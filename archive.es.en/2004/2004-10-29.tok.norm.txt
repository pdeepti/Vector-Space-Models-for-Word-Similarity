but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "

that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2004 working women face upward battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as top managers are still the exception in germany germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .
why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .
" the number of women in leading positions is slowing but surely rising , " bda 's köster said .
" it 's just a matter of time , although it 's not moving as quickly as we 'd like . " sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering plans to appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board - a sad first for germany .
no other industrial nation has as few female top managers as germany .
-lrb- july 10 , 2004 -rrb- germany struggles to close daycare gap the childcare crisis in germany has reached epic proportions .
politicians are trying to plug the holes , but parents and experts remain skeptical .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .
" the number of women in leading positions is slowing but surely rising , " bda 's köster said .
" it 's just a matter of time , although it 's not moving as quickly as we 'd like .

if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .

increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links .

not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .

past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .

the coalition pointed to tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in human rights . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has voted against lifting the european arms embargo against china , in direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .
the motion made future weapons exports dependent on china signing up to the united nations pact on political and human rights .
the foreign affairs spokesman for the greens ' parliamentary group , ludger volmer , said china 's tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in the area of human rights " make arms exports to china out of the question at the moment . "
the eu had introduced the embargo in 1989 after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 's tiananmen square which left hundreds of people dead .
eu split over ban but schröder and french president jacques chirac advocate a suspension of the eu arms embargo . last december , schröder - who has been keen to increase trade relations with beijing - expressed his desire to end the ban during a state visit to china .
the chancellor has frequently stressed how much china has changed since it violently suppressed the pro-democracy protests 15 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his china visit with chinese parliament chief wu bangguo .
while in china earlier in october , chirac echoed his german neighbor when he said " most eu countries " were in favor of rescinding the embargo .
yet chirac may have been counting his chickens before they hatched .
just after his china visit , eu foreign ministers expressed skepticism and voted to review the matter .
spearheaded by britain , the scandinavian countries and some of the new eu members from eastern europe such as poland and the czech republic , a good portion of the bloc opposed any resumption of arms sales to china .
washington favors keeping ban outside of europe , the us has also opposed plans to renew arms trade with china .
the state department said that if the eu were to lift sanctions , it would contribute to regional instability because high-tech military equipment from europe , such as radar and communications gear , could be used to intimidate taiwan further and even threaten us troops in the region .
the us also fears that a suspension of the embargo would hurt efforts to improve human rights in china .
french president chirac does not necessarily share that opinion .
during his last visit , he called the ban the product of " another time , " much to the irritation of human rights group and politicians back home .
alain madelin , a lawmaker in chirac 's ruling party , told french radio , " china needs human rights , freedom .
it does n't need our weapons . "
for the time being , china will not be receiving any weapons or military equipment from the european union despite the fact that schröder and chirac both are convinced otherwise . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe remains skeptical of china while a flurry of eu delegations pay tribute to beijing 's growing economic prowess , many still harbor reservations about china 's human rights record as evidenced by brussels ' recent decision to continue the arms embargo .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .

british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 29.10.2004 traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't like germans , but they like bert trautmann the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .
it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

the coalition pointed to tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in human rights . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has voted against lifting the european arms embargo against china , in direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .
the motion made future weapons exports dependent on china signing up to the united nations pact on political and human rights .
the foreign affairs spokesman for the greens ' parliamentary group , ludger volmer , said china 's tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in the area of human rights " make arms exports to china out of the question at the moment . "
the eu had introduced the embargo in 1989 after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 's tiananmen square which left hundreds of people dead .
eu split over ban but schröder and french president jacques chirac advocate a suspension of the eu arms embargo . last december , schröder - who has been keen to increase trade relations with beijing - expressed his desire to end the ban during a state visit to china .
the chancellor has frequently stressed how much china has changed since it violently suppressed the pro-democracy protests 15 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his china visit with chinese parliament chief wu bangguo .
while in china earlier in october , chirac echoed his german neighbor when he said " most eu countries " were in favor of rescinding the embargo .
yet chirac may have been counting his chickens before they hatched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.10.2004 opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history is being written on rome 's capitoline hill although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert . the first european constitution is n't a constitution in the obvious sense .
it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .
previous treaties would simply retain their validity .
europe would have to pull itself together and hope for better luck next time . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome is hosting the prestigious signing ceremony for the new european constitution friday .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .

establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .
" we realize that the world is more important than its borders , and that everything crosses borders , including media . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the 2004 us presidental election .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .
he signed off the letter by stressing " his sincerest wishes for a recovery " and extending his " cordial friendship . "
but many feel that even if arafat regains his health , his political battle is lost . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for freezing palestinian aid amidst corruption allegations and a leadership crisis , a growing chorus of german politicians are calling for measures to be taken against the government of yasser arafat , including a freezing of european union aid .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "

british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 29.10.2004 traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't like germans , but they like bert trautmann the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .
it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe europe -pipe- 29.10.2004 european media offers advice on us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry gets the international vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .
" the number of women in leading positions is slowing but surely rising , " bda 's köster said .
" it 's just a matter of time , although it 's not moving as quickly as we 'd like .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .

despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 29.10.2004 traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't like germans , but they like bert trautmann the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .
it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .

28 , 2004 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern .

in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .

the coalition pointed to tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in human rights . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has voted against lifting the european arms embargo against china , in direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .
the motion made future weapons exports dependent on china signing up to the united nations pact on political and human rights .
the foreign affairs spokesman for the greens ' parliamentary group , ludger volmer , said china 's tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in the area of human rights " make arms exports to china out of the question at the moment . "
the eu had introduced the embargo in 1989 after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 's tiananmen square which left hundreds of people dead .
eu split over ban but schröder and french president jacques chirac advocate a suspension of the eu arms embargo . last december , schröder - who has been keen to increase trade relations with beijing - expressed his desire to end the ban during a state visit to china .
the chancellor has frequently stressed how much china has changed since it violently suppressed the pro-democracy protests 15 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his china visit with chinese parliament chief wu bangguo .
while in china earlier in october , chirac echoed his german neighbor when he said " most eu countries " were in favor of rescinding the embargo .
yet chirac may have been counting his chickens before they hatched .
just after his china visit , eu foreign ministers expressed skepticism and voted to review the matter .
spearheaded by britain , the scandinavian countries and some of the new eu members from eastern europe such as poland and the czech republic , a good portion of the bloc opposed any resumption of arms sales to china .
washington favors keeping ban outside of europe , the us has also opposed plans to renew arms trade with china .
the state department said that if the eu were to lift sanctions , it would contribute to regional instability because high-tech military equipment from europe , such as radar and communications gear , could be used to intimidate taiwan further and even threaten us troops in the region .
the us also fears that a suspension of the embargo would hurt efforts to improve human rights in china .
french president chirac does not necessarily share that opinion .
during his last visit , he called the ban the product of " another time , " much to the irritation of human rights group and politicians back home .
alain madelin , a lawmaker in chirac 's ruling party , told french radio , " china needs human rights , freedom .
it does n't need our weapons . "
for the time being , china will not be receiving any weapons or military equipment from the european union despite the fact that schröder and chirac both are convinced otherwise . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe remains skeptical of china while a flurry of eu delegations pay tribute to beijing 's growing economic prowess , many still harbor reservations about china 's human rights record as evidenced by brussels ' recent decision to continue the arms embargo .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .

past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .

but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .

the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .
he signed off the letter by stressing " his sincerest wishes for a recovery " and extending his " cordial friendship . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2004 working women face upward battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as top managers are still the exception in germany germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .
why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .
" the number of women in leading positions is slowing but surely rising , " bda 's köster said .
" it 's just a matter of time , although it 's not moving as quickly as we 'd like .

but the crisis surrounding the bloc 's leadership threatens to steal the limelight . security measures were tight ahead of the arrival of hundreds of dignitaries for the signing of the european union 's proposed new constitution . leaders and governments of the 25 eu member states and four candidate nations will be taking part in the event , which will be held on the capitoline hill . deputy president of the european convention and one of the founding fathers of the treaty , giuliano amato , expressed his satisfaction . " with this constitution , we take a step forward , " he said .
" we thereby establish a more visible system and reaffirm the existence of a european system of government with growing characteristics of democracy . " hundreds of policemen were already patrolling the streets thursday .
authorities also took the unprecedented step of blocking off traffic to the heart of the city in order to guarantee the safety of the delegations .
they further decided to close major roman landmarks , like the colosseum and the roman forum . unforeseen obstacles italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi must have felt confident he had everything under control .
he 'd pushed for the signing to take place in rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor konrad adenauer -lrb- left -rrb- and state secretary walter hallstein sign the treaty of rome on march 25 , 1957 .
after all , the italian capital hosted the historic endorsement of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community 47 years ago . but then , berlusconi found himself overtaken by events he had n't predicted . consulting on the future incoming eu commission president jose barroso was forced wednesday to withdraw his proposed team after it became clear the european parliament was about to reject it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione sparked a large controversy in the eu parliament .
the flare-up centered on the italian candidate for the commission , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was nominated to be justice commissioner . many european parliament deputies were outraged by a recent comment made by buttiglione describing homosexuality as a sin .
buttiglione 's conservative views on women and marriage have also met with criticism . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi approved barroso 's decision to retract his line-up to allow for a period of reflection . the rome gathering will now also be an opportunity for eu leaders to consult on the future of buttiglione .
barroso has said he will make all necessary adjustments to his team and hopes to resolve the impasse in the next few weeks . in the meantime , outgoing commission president romano prodi has agreed to stay on until a new executive team wins the parliament 's approval . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president-in-waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.10.2004 opinion : the constitution is n't perfect but must do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history is being written on rome 's capitoline hill although the eu constitution has plenty of flaws and it still has to be ratified by member states , it reflects a compromise and marks the dawning of a new era , says dw 's bernd riegert . the first european constitution is n't a constitution in the obvious sense .
it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .

the coalition pointed to tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in human rights . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has voted against lifting the european arms embargo against china , in direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .
the motion made future weapons exports dependent on china signing up to the united nations pact on political and human rights .
the foreign affairs spokesman for the greens ' parliamentary group , ludger volmer , said china 's tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in the area of human rights " make arms exports to china out of the question at the moment . "
the eu had introduced the embargo in 1989 after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 's tiananmen square which left hundreds of people dead .
eu split over ban but schröder and french president jacques chirac advocate a suspension of the eu arms embargo . last december , schröder - who has been keen to increase trade relations with beijing - expressed his desire to end the ban during a state visit to china .

the state department said that if the eu were to lift sanctions , it would contribute to regional instability because high-tech military equipment from europe , such as radar and communications gear , could be used to intimidate taiwan further and even threaten us troops in the region .
the us also fears that a suspension of the embargo would hurt efforts to improve human rights in china .
french president chirac does not necessarily share that opinion .
during his last visit , he called the ban the product of " another time , " much to the irritation of human rights group and politicians back home .
alain madelin , a lawmaker in chirac 's ruling party , told french radio , " china needs human rights , freedom .

spearheaded by britain , the scandinavian countries and some of the new eu members from eastern europe such as poland and the czech republic , a good portion of the bloc opposed any resumption of arms sales to china .
washington favors keeping ban outside of europe , the us has also opposed plans to renew arms trade with china .
the state department said that if the eu were to lift sanctions , it would contribute to regional instability because high-tech military equipment from europe , such as radar and communications gear , could be used to intimidate taiwan further and even threaten us troops in the region .
the us also fears that a suspension of the embargo would hurt efforts to improve human rights in china .
french president chirac does not necessarily share that opinion .
during his last visit , he called the ban the product of " another time , " much to the irritation of human rights group and politicians back home .
alain madelin , a lawmaker in chirac 's ruling party , told french radio , " china needs human rights , freedom .
it does n't need our weapons . "
for the time being , china will not be receiving any weapons or military equipment from the european union despite the fact that schröder and chirac both are convinced otherwise . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe remains skeptical of china while a flurry of eu delegations pay tribute to beijing 's growing economic prowess , many still harbor reservations about china 's human rights record as evidenced by brussels ' recent decision to continue the arms embargo .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .

british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 29.10.2004 traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't like germans , but they like bert trautmann the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .
it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

28 , 2004 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .
previous treaties would simply retain their validity .
europe would have to pull itself together and hope for better luck next time . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome is hosting the prestigious signing ceremony for the new european constitution friday .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .

despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .

dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .

2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .

the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de glossary : the european union from a-z 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "

that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2004 working women face upward battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as top managers are still the exception in germany germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .
why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .
" the number of women in leading positions is slowing but surely rising , " bda 's köster said .
" it 's just a matter of time , although it 's not moving as quickly as we 'd like . " sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering plans to appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board - a sad first for germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2004 working women face upward battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as top managers are still the exception in germany germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .
why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .
" you do n't just reach your goals through qualifications and hard work , but also through the right contacts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it not about what you know , but rather who you know ?
hence , the old boys networks were born .
mentoring between men has been around for thousands of years .
in greek mythology , mentor was a friend of odysseus , who gave advice to his son telemachus .
his name is synonymous with the concept of a faithful and wise adviser .
in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .
on their career path , women face more and other restraints than men , the ihk 's hindenberg said .
since they 're confronted with different challenges , they need different strategies to deal with them .
the ihk , for example , has just announced it will offer a six-month course called " fit for success " for women in management positions .
but the course does n't cover rhetoric or communication .
rather , it will teach women the rules of the game in the top echelons and the strategies needed to get there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt , federal minister of family affairs , is a strong proponent of helping women to the top .
however , minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said that women 's opportunities can not be achieved by adapting to the male model of life .
" rather , we need a model in which not the men set the benchmark , which women must adapt to , but where the needs of women , children and men are the gage , " she said in a statement .
a matter of time according to the ihk , of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 leading companies , seven are held by women .
one of the few , karin dorrepaal , recently became the first woman to be named to the executive board of one of the 30 blue chip companies listed on the german stock index , pharmaceutical giant schering .
perhaps this appointment marks the beginning of a new era of top female managers .
" the number of women in leading positions is slowing but surely rising , " bda 's köster said .
" it 's just a matter of time , although it 's not moving as quickly as we 'd like . " sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering plans to appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board - a sad first for germany .
no other industrial nation has as few female top managers as germany .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .
he signed off the letter by stressing " his sincerest wishes for a recovery " and extending his " cordial friendship . "

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .

the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .

the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .
previous treaties would simply retain their validity .
europe would have to pull itself together and hope for better luck next time . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome is hosting the prestigious signing ceremony for the new european constitution friday .

in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .

the coalition pointed to tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in human rights . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has voted against lifting the european arms embargo against china , in direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .
the motion made future weapons exports dependent on china signing up to the united nations pact on political and human rights .
the foreign affairs spokesman for the greens ' parliamentary group , ludger volmer , said china 's tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in the area of human rights " make arms exports to china out of the question at the moment . "
the eu had introduced the embargo in 1989 after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 's tiananmen square which left hundreds of people dead .
eu split over ban but schröder and french president jacques chirac advocate a suspension of the eu arms embargo . last december , schröder - who has been keen to increase trade relations with beijing - expressed his desire to end the ban during a state visit to china .
the chancellor has frequently stressed how much china has changed since it violently suppressed the pro-democracy protests 15 years ago .

just after his china visit , eu foreign ministers expressed skepticism and voted to review the matter .
spearheaded by britain , the scandinavian countries and some of the new eu members from eastern europe such as poland and the czech republic , a good portion of the bloc opposed any resumption of arms sales to china .
washington favors keeping ban outside of europe , the us has also opposed plans to renew arms trade with china .
the state department said that if the eu were to lift sanctions , it would contribute to regional instability because high-tech military equipment from europe , such as radar and communications gear , could be used to intimidate taiwan further and even threaten us troops in the region .
the us also fears that a suspension of the embargo would hurt efforts to improve human rights in china .
french president chirac does not necessarily share that opinion .
during his last visit , he called the ban the product of " another time , " much to the irritation of human rights group and politicians back home .
alain madelin , a lawmaker in chirac 's ruling party , told french radio , " china needs human rights , freedom .
it does n't need our weapons . "

british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 29.10.2004 traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't like germans , but they like bert trautmann the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .
it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .
-lrb- oct .
28 , 2004 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .

dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .

it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .

majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .
in december , government leaders were scheduled to give their final stamp of approval at an eu summit in rome , but they were unable to agree on many of the key points , specifically voting procedures .
dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .
in december , government leaders were scheduled to give their final stamp of approval at an eu summit in rome , but they were unable to agree on many of the key points , specifically voting procedures .
dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .

it marks neither the founding of a new european super-state , nor does it iron out the many differences between the bloc 's 25 nations . the " constitution " label basically describes a new treaty based on international law between sovereign states , which joins together the various treaties in eu history , ranging from rome and maastricht to amsterdam and nice . it foresees streamlining european law and allowing for a more transparent relationship between the institutions - although the eu commission , currently a major sticking point , still occupies an uneasy position between the european council and the parliament . the constitution will also be introducing two new top positions : an eu president appointed by the council as its representative for two years ; and a european foreign minister expected to represent the eu 's foreign policy - sketchy as this may be - on the world stage . greater scope for identification what is new , however , is the constitution 's proposed voting system .
all but the most sensitive eu decisions are now to be decided by a so-called " double majority " system under which an eu decision would need support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population . majority decision-making is set to be introduced in certain areas for the first time , while it wo n't apply in areas such as foreign , economic and defense policy - those areas particularly sensitive to national interests . the role of the parliament , which this week bared its teeth and showed the commission who 's boss , is set to be strengthened , while the leading role of the council , which represents the member states , remains unchanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission , the breydel building supporters of the new constitution hope it will give the people of europe greater scope to identify with their historically unique union .
its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .

its detractors , meanwhile , believe that the highly complex constitution is packed with impenetrable legalese that leaves brussels with even more of a bureaucratic headache than ever . but will it ever take effect ? it will be interesting to see how implementing the constitution develops .
establishing a standardized , user-friendly legal framework for the recently-expanded 25 bloc was clearly long overdue . but will it ever take effect ?
it still has to be ratified in every member state over the next two years , and at least eight of them are expected to hold a referendum next year .
past experience in france , ireland , denmark and sweden has shown that the electorate often defies the ambitions of the political elite . it seems highly likely that people in britain , poland and france will reject the constitution .
it looks as though germany , meanwhile , the bloc 's largest member , has decided to rule out a referendum on the grounds that the constitution is so complex and important that it makes a simple yes or no impossible .
moreover , it 's an issue that could all too easily be co-opted by domestic , populist lobby groups . a compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valéry giscard d 'estaing everyone agrees that the constitution , as fleshed out by a european convention of lawmakers and national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- pictured -rrb- , is a compromise .
but under the circumstances , it 's the best that could be hoped for . it has obvious weaknesses .
the possibility , for example , of altering its existing form has not been addressed .
again , the question is unanimity .
nonetheless , it 's apparent even today that the constitution will need rewriting in the not too distant future .
the possibility of turkey 's accession will make this necessary , for a start . admitting a country with turkey 's size and population will require immediate overhauling of the constitution 's decision-making processes as well as its economic stipulations .
the accession treaty to be signed by up to 28 states -lrb- including current members as well as the next round of candidates romania , bulgaria and croatia -rrb- will necessitate new international law and also require an altered constitution . a new era what began in rome in 1957 as a six-member body is now poised on the threshold of a new era .
the constitution illustrates just how far peaceful integration within post-war europe has come .
it 's a path that can only lead forward , and despite the many obstacles strewn along the way , it 's one that blazes a trail for other parts of the world . if the constitution does not take effect in 2007 as planned , it would hardly spell the end of the eu .
previous treaties would simply retain their validity .
europe would have to pull itself together and hope for better luck next time . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome is hosting the prestigious signing ceremony for the new european constitution friday .

the coalition pointed to tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in human rights . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has voted against lifting the european arms embargo against china , in direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in a parliamentary motion on thursday , the greens and schröder 's own social democratic party rejected a resumption of arms sales to china by the european union .
the motion made future weapons exports dependent on china signing up to the united nations pact on political and human rights .
the foreign affairs spokesman for the greens ' parliamentary group , ludger volmer , said china 's tensions with taiwan and " massive deficits " in the area of human rights " make arms exports to china out of the question at the moment . "

eu split over ban but schröder and french president jacques chirac advocate a suspension of the eu arms embargo . last december , schröder - who has been keen to increase trade relations with beijing - expressed his desire to end the ban during a state visit to china .

washington favors keeping ban outside of europe , the us has also opposed plans to renew arms trade with china .
the state department said that if the eu were to lift sanctions , it would contribute to regional instability because high-tech military equipment from europe , such as radar and communications gear , could be used to intimidate taiwan further and even threaten us troops in the region .
the us also fears that a suspension of the embargo would hurt efforts to improve human rights in china .
french president chirac does not necessarily share that opinion .

british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 29.10.2004 traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't like germans , but they like bert trautmann the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . " " watch for her gestures rather than her words , " advised a palace official ahead of queen elisabeth 's three-day state visit .
it was a somewhat euphemistic way of saying her majesty most certainly will not be saying sorry for anything , which is bound to come as disappointment to german mass-circulation daily bild . germany 's most-read newspaper recently launched an inflammatory campaign called " will the queen apologize ? " and the answer is : " no , she wo n't . "
on the agenda , however , is a concert at the berlin philharmonic - intended to raise money for the final restoration of the dresden frauenkirche , destroyed in 1945 .
it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .

28 , 2004 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern .

it 's the closest approximation of an apology bild is going to get . traut the kraut shows the way others are more willing to help break down prejudices . the queen will have an unexpected companion on her german tour : bert trautmann , otherwise known as " traut the kraut , " will be presented with the order of the british empire in berlin next week for his efforts to improve german-british relations . now 82 , trautman first arrived in england as a prisoner of war and outraged fans when he joined first division club manchester city in 1949 . back then , some 40,000 people took to the streets to protest his signing .
his spectacular goalkeeping soon won them over , but it was n't until he broke his neck and continued playing in the 1956 cup final that the british public realized this was a man it could trust . later that year he was the first foreigner ever to be named " footballer of the year . " rediscovering national pride recent years have seen a sea-change in germany 's relationship with its turbulent past .
increasingly , a new generation of artists , bands , film-makers and fashion designers are breaking with the country 's post-war legacy of guilt and are n't ashamed to embrace their national identity . it 's a trend increasingly reflected in germany 's cultural establishment .
günter grass , winner of the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , risked charges of revisionism by addressing the topic of germany 's own suffering in his novel " crabwalk . "
the book explored the effect on three generations of the torpedoing of the wilhelm gustloff ship in 1945 , one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time which cost 9,000 german men , women , and children their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author friedrich jörg historian jörg friedrich -lrb- pictured -rrb- went one step further with his 2002 book " the fire , " about the destruction of german cities by allied bombs .
not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .

28 , 2004 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe europe -pipe- 29.10.2004 european media offers advice on us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry gets the international vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .
" we realize that the world is more important than its borders , and that everything crosses borders , including media . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the 2004 us presidental election .
bild backs bush europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe europe -pipe- 29.10.2004 european media offers advice on us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry gets the international vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .

not surprisingly , it was serialized in bild . in august , chancellor schöder demonstrated how much world war ii is bound up with private sorrow for many germans when he paid his first-ever visit to the grave of his father , a soldier who fell in romania in 1944 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from " the downfall " after decades of shying away from dramatizing world war ii , the public 's largely positive reception to acclaimed film director bernd eichinger 's big budget movie " the downfall , " which charts hitler 's last ten days in his berlin bunker , also goes to show how much progress germans have made in coming to terms with their history . rewriting history ? recognizing that germans were also victims in world war ii is one thing , but to most of the country , the latest bild campaign is embarrassingly over-the-top . and after all , a recent british council survey shows that more germans dislike their own country more than they dislike britain . the german press might have overstepped the mark , but britain sure is bearing a grudge . speculation about the possible apology first surfaced last week in british tabloid newspaper the daily express , which was followed by a comment piece in the rival daily mail written by right-wing columnist simon heffer which has been given widespread coverage in germany . entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the idea of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " evil sells her majesty 's trip comes one week after the german government invited 20 english history teachers to reappraise their image of germany on a six-day , all-expenses-paid trip .
but five-star hotel accommodation and a night at the berlin state opera were n't enough to persuade them to look beyond third reich stereotypes .
everything else is just too dull , apparently . " the problem with the nazis is that they are sexy , " gerald clarke told british newspaper the guardian .
" evil is fascinating . " asked whether he 'd teach german studies differently in future , another member of the group expressed surprise .
" i 'm doubtful , " he said . bild , meanwhile , did an about-turn friday and decided it would show up its british counterparts and celebrate german-british links . " if all the nations in the world felt as close as this , the world would be a better place , " it said in an editorial . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers . " it 's another symbol of globalization , " roy greenslade , a british journalism professor and media columnist , told the reuters news agency .

but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest . us president george bush has always been a polarizing figure for most europeans .
his folksy charm and texan cowboy image may play to the worst stereotypes that some in europe have of america , but the majority of eu citizens also strongly disagree with bush 's policies on the war in iraq , the environment and international law . the watershed of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states prodded bush to radically reshape american foreign policy , often in ways that non-americans found arrogant and brash .
with the wide-ranging implications for the rest of the world hinging on the outcome of the us election , many of europe 's newspapers and magazines have decided to go so far as to endorse a candidate this year . unsurprisingly perhaps , much of the european press has come out in favor of bush 's opponent john kerry .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because the world belongs to everyone and everyone 's future was at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
it noted that while in the us the race between kerry and bush is a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation . backlash for the guardian the left-leaning guardian newspaper even started a letter-writing campaign that encouraged british citizens to contact potential swing-voters in the hotly contested state of ohio .
however , that initiative backfired after the london paper received hundreds of complaints about foreign meddling in us affairs . the guardian was backed in its support for kerry by the business-oriented financial times .
it called bush 's challenger " the better , safer choice " for americans to pick next week .
even the respected british economist newsmagazine on thursday reversed its 2000 endorsement of bush , arguing this year kerry was the man for the most important job on the planet . " it was a difficult call , " said the economist editor bill emmott .
" but in the end we felt -lsb- bush -rsb- has been too incompetent to deserve re-election . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist said it has a right to plead for a us candidate since some 45 percent of its sales were in the united states .
that ca n't be said for germany 's tabloid bild .
however , the paper does have the largest circulation in europe , reaching an estimated 12 million readers daily .
despite germans ' overwhelming antipathy for bush and his policies , bild was one of the few foreign publications to back the incumbent for reelection .
bild for bush published by the conservative springer verlag , bild said bush was a known quantity in europe and that he had learned from the mistakes of his first term .
the paper also argued bush had a better sense than kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners .
that 's a reference to the assumption that kerry will ask iraq war opponents france and germany to contribute troops to help stabilize the country . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the endorsement . the tabloid also said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . of course , most americans are left cold by all of the interest in their election , but that likely wo n't stop europeans and others from offering their opinions in the future according to some media watchers .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .
he signed off the letter by stressing " his sincerest wishes for a recovery " and extending his " cordial friendship . "
but many feel that even if arafat regains his health , his political battle is lost . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for freezing palestinian aid amidst corruption allegations and a leadership crisis , a growing chorus of german politicians are calling for measures to be taken against the government of yasser arafat , including a freezing of european union aid .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .
but carlotta köster from the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- disagrees .
" we can not back this up with facts , " köster told dw-world .
a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .
as family structures have changed , and there 's no longer a grandmother nearby to help with the children , working women are dependent on public or private childcare facilities .
and there are simply too few of them in germany .
" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .
but with a rise in position , the ratio deviates .
birds of a feather stick together various studies suggest that the concept of gender plays a large role here , too .
top positions are associated with common " male " traits , such as aggressiveness and the ability to assert oneself .
and these are characteristics , which women " typically " do n't have .
but women themselves are also often too modest , said schmidt .
" women tend to hide their light under a bushel , " the minister said in a statement earlier this year .
it is also human nature to favor working with a person who is similar to oneself .
since most top managers are men , they tend to choose younger men to follow in their footsteps .
the fact that even women without families who do not want children are less likely to be helped up the career ladder supports this theory .
the old boys networks " men have long since recognized the principle of success , " schmidt has said .

in the meantime , all large german companies have mentoring and shadowing programs to support young women in their ranks , too .
and it makes sense to continue to help them , when you consider the economic costs of educating women , according to schmidt .
" if germany wants to remain internationally competitive , it would be economic nonsense to not take advantage of the qualifications of over half of the population : women , " she said .
women must be armed but while the german economy can not do without women , they in turn have to be ready for a rough climate .

why is it so difficult for women to get ahead in europe 's largest economy ? go to any german university campus , and you 'll see endless female faces .
but in most german boardrooms , the only women you 'll see are the ones serving the coffee .
" it 's certainly not a question of qualifications , " said jürgen hindenberg , head of the association for further training at the chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- ihk -rrb- in bonn , at the presentation of a new course for female managers .
half of university graduates in germany are women .
but less than 4 percent of them make it into leading management positions .
renate schmidt , the federal minister for family affairs , has said too few women are top managers because of attitude .
" the most serious cause for this is still the bias that women are not motivated and suitable enough , " according to schmidt .

a career or a family : " a sad development " köster said that the dearth of women in executive positions development was mainly due to the " catastrophic situation " of child care in germany .
a woman wanting to climb the career ladder to the top is expected to work longer hours and show more dedication to her job .
" but what can she do with her children if she works late or has to go on a business trip ? " said köster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is very difficult for german women to have both children and a career .

" a lot of women feel that they ca n't have both children and a career , " said köster .
she said a recent study found that 40 percent of women with university degrees between the ages of 30 and 35 do not even have children .
" this is a sad development . "
bda figures show that in lower management , the relation of men and women is 50-50 .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .
he signed off the letter by stressing " his sincerest wishes for a recovery " and extending his " cordial friendship . "
but many feel that even if arafat regains his health , his political battle is lost . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for freezing palestinian aid amidst corruption allegations and a leadership crisis , a growing chorus of german politicians are calling for measures to be taken against the government of yasser arafat , including a freezing of european union aid .

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .
yet the poor health of the palestinian leader will have a significant impact on the future of the middle east .
gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for germany 's ruling social democrats , said the time had come for a change in the palestinian leadership .
" arafat 's system is drawing to an end , " he told german public radio südwestfunk .
" i think that this is exactly the right time for more moderate forces to fill this vacuum , " said weisskirchen .
" they could give palestine a real chance at being part of a process to move forward together with israel . "
but german foreign minister joschka fischer said that he foresees no void in the palestinian leadership despite arafat 's hospitalization .
" i have the impression that there will not be a power vacuum , rather on the contrary everything will be done to avoid that , " fischer said .
europe needs to get involved according to weisskirchen , there were by all means " level-headed people " next in line among palestinian politicians .
he said moderates at the helm would presumably give the guarantee that they will act as europe expects .
" at any rate , they 'll know that they will only get infrastructure and financial support when they are free of corruption , " weisskirchen said .
" this will be a stipulation for aid by the european union . "
christian sterzing from the german heinrich böll foundation 's office in ramallah said now is the chance for europe to get re-involved in the middle east .
" they have to finally forget their reservations and hit on this vacuum , " he told deutschlandfunk .
due to the elections in the united states , it could take months before a new us administration would be fit for work .
" but the developments here are so rapid that there needs to be immediate and quick support , " said sterzing .
he said he hoped that eu foreign policy chief javier solana will be able to suggest a realistic plan of action to the eu foreign ministers .
" there are signs that the eu is ready to return to action , " said sterzing .
arafat 's political battle is lost medics have diagnosed the 75-year-old arafat as suffering from a potentially fatal blood disorder .
this required further tests outside the west bank , where he has been kept under virtual house arrest for the last three years .
the israeli government , whose troops had been confining him to his west bank headquarters , said earlier that it would authorize arafat to leave his base for treatment and return thereafter .
on thursday , french president jacques chirac sent a get-well message to the man who has come to symbolize the palestinian struggle for independence .
" france , as you know , backs the aspirations you embody for the creation of a viable , prosperous and peaceful palestinian state alongside a state of israel assured of its security , " the president wrote .
he signed off the letter by stressing " his sincerest wishes for a recovery " and extending his " cordial friendship . "

even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician . yasser arafat appeared in good spirits as he arrived at a french military hospital in the southwestern paris suburb of clamart on friday .

in a study undertaken by the bi construction sector association on payment morale in the industry , the federation found that public-sector companies and institutions were slower at settling their bills than private companies .
and that was often disastrous for small and mid-sized builders , bi chief michael kniepper said .
the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn was slowest of all , with construction firms often having to wait 99 days before receiving their money , much longer than the recommended norm of 46 days .
that meant that small and mid-sized companies , who often depended almost solely on deutsche bahn for contracts , frequently had to take out bank loans to finance the purchase of materials and equipment .
" this is a case of a monopolist flexing his muscles to the full , " knipper criticized . more briefs 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler allegedly probed over secret bank accounts 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler stands by smart 28.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler steers back into profit 28.10.2004 -pipe- altana suffers setback in launch of asthma drugs 28.10.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank buys portfolio from ing bhf 27.10.2004 -pipe- vw seeks to boost us phaeton sales 27.10.2004 -pipe- chemicals giant celanese to cut jobs 27.10.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank mulls job cuts radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .
in december , government leaders were scheduled to give their final stamp of approval at an eu summit in rome , but they were unable to agree on many of the key points , specifically voting procedures .
dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de glossary : the european union from a-z radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .

dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .

it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .

the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .

dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .

2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .

a group of 105 delegates led by french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing spent 16 months drafting the blueprint at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in july 2003 .
the draft was then discussed by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference in october .
in december , government leaders were scheduled to give their final stamp of approval at an eu summit in rome , but they were unable to agree on many of the key points , specifically voting procedures .
dw-world has put together a quick reader 's guide on the most important points in the draft constitution . foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .

the station at ebbsfleet will be on the route from st pancras to the channel tunnel when the route opens in 2007 .

a lawyer for a us army official has said the fbi has asked to speak to his client about how the army gave the firm a key deal to restore iraqi oil .
the fbi claims come as a us government inquiry continues to look at why the deal was not put open to competition .
halliburton , once run by vice president dick cheney , dismissed the fbi claim .
mr cheney led halliburton between 1995 and 2000 .
' political move ' wendy hall , a halliburton spokeswoman , dismissed the allegation as election politics .
the initiation of an fbi investigation into criminal misconduct will help restore public confidence lawyer michael kohn " the old allegations have once again been recycled , this time one week before the election , " she said .
ms hall added that while the company was co-operating with various investigations , the auditing arm of the us congress - the government accountability office - had found that halliburton 's no-bid work in iraq was legal .
she said the multibillion-dollar contract to restore iraqi oil facilities was rightly given to halliburton because it was the only company that could have carried out the work .
' whistleblower ' the fbi has declined to comment on the allegations that it is now investigating the matter .
bunnatine greenhouse , the army corps of engineers ' chief contracting officer , went public last weekend with allegations that her agency unfairly awarded halliburton subsidiary kbr no-bid contracts .
her lawyer , michael kohn , said the involvement of the fbi " underscores the seriousness of the misconduct , and it also demonstrates how courageous ms greenhouse was for stepping forward " .
mr kohn added : " the initiation of an fbi investigation into criminal misconduct will help restore public confidence .
" the army must aggressively protect ms greenhouse from the retaliation she will encounter as a result of blowing the whistle on this misconduct , " he told the associated press .
