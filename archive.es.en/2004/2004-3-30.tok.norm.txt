they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .
-lrb- march 8 , 2004 -rrb- could longer work hours revive the german economy ?
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .

more flexibility could be a solution . for years , weekly working hours have been on a continual decline in germany .
in the metal and electrical industry , with more than 3 million employees the economy 's biggest sector , for example , western germany has had the 35-hour week for nearly ten years .
now things are going in the other direction .
the 40-hour week has been reintroduced for civil servants , and the remaining federal , state and municipal employees are also expected to work one and a half hours longer each week .
in rare unanimity , the state premiers cancelled the applicable collective labor agreement last week .
opposition party leaders see it as a signal for the private sector too . times have gotten tougher for the german economy .
and it 's easy to foresee that they will become even tougher due to the growing globalization of the world economy .
germany must protect its ability to compete internationally , so roll up those sleeves and get to work .
do n't just work more but work longer .
and do it without compensation , that is , more work without more pay .
the trade unions see this as a challenge to the current social situation and want to prevent working hours from being extended , even if they have to resort to strikes .
that 's the current status of the discussion . bypassing the real issues unfortunately , the debate misses the heart of the issue .
it 's a shame , since blanket solutions are hardly helpful to everyday operations .
for one , the extended presence of civil servants in no way means that more work will be done .
nor would longer work hours result in the loss of 100,000 jobs , as the german trade union federation dgb fears . in contrast , production is much more directly linked to working hours in the private sector .
but there no one is demanding employers introduce an across-the-board extension of working hours .
instead , they are calling for more flexibility . shorter week was a failure the fact is that shortening the work week to as little as 35 hours has been proven wrong , since work has not only become more scarce but also more expensive .
first , companies reacted by rationalizing and automating production , then , by relocating work-intensive manufacturing to so-called low-wage countries .
the result is that work has become increasingly more stressful , and less and less of it takes place in germany . shortening work hours failed to prevent the rise in unemployment .
instead , it boosted automation and outsourcing .
in broad areas of production , on assembly lines , for example , the development is irreversible - even if work hours are extended without wage compensation .
in the services industry unpaid overtime has long been the norm .
but that 's not a desirable model for the future . instead , when it comes to working hours a maximum of flexibility is necessary .
the " breathing factory " is necessary .
when order volume is high , people must work more .
the additional work can be compensated by free time during slack periods .
working hours should reflect orders received .
such a model for the work week - which is already being practiced in many places - has a future . karl zawadzky -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions threaten strike to prevent longer hours , same pay germany 's unions are vehemently opposed to plans for lengthening working hours without wage increases .

in the metal and electrical industry , with more than 3 million employees the economy 's biggest sector , for example , western germany has had the 35-hour week for nearly ten years .
now things are going in the other direction .
the 40-hour week has been reintroduced for civil servants , and the remaining federal , state and municipal employees are also expected to work one and a half hours longer each week .
in rare unanimity , the state premiers cancelled the applicable collective labor agreement last week .
opposition party leaders see it as a signal for the private sector too . times have gotten tougher for the german economy .
and it 's easy to foresee that they will become even tougher due to the growing globalization of the world economy .
germany must protect its ability to compete internationally , so roll up those sleeves and get to work .
do n't just work more but work longer .
and do it without compensation , that is , more work without more pay .
the trade unions see this as a challenge to the current social situation and want to prevent working hours from being extended , even if they have to resort to strikes .
that 's the current status of the discussion . bypassing the real issues unfortunately , the debate misses the heart of the issue .
it 's a shame , since blanket solutions are hardly helpful to everyday operations .
for one , the extended presence of civil servants in no way means that more work will be done .
nor would longer work hours result in the loss of 100,000 jobs , as the german trade union federation dgb fears . in contrast , production is much more directly linked to working hours in the private sector .
but there no one is demanding employers introduce an across-the-board extension of working hours .
instead , they are calling for more flexibility . shorter week was a failure the fact is that shortening the work week to as little as 35 hours has been proven wrong , since work has not only become more scarce but also more expensive .
first , companies reacted by rationalizing and automating production , then , by relocating work-intensive manufacturing to so-called low-wage countries .
the result is that work has become increasingly more stressful , and less and less of it takes place in germany . shortening work hours failed to prevent the rise in unemployment .
instead , it boosted automation and outsourcing .
in broad areas of production , on assembly lines , for example , the development is irreversible - even if work hours are extended without wage compensation .
in the services industry unpaid overtime has long been the norm .
but that 's not a desirable model for the future . instead , when it comes to working hours a maximum of flexibility is necessary .
the " breathing factory " is necessary .
when order volume is high , people must work more .
the additional work can be compensated by free time during slack periods .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .
struck is confident he will be able to defend his budget against attempts by finance minister hans eichel to cut government spending wherever possible . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck : nato needs to stay in kosovo beyond 2006 german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region .

they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .

" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .

" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .

fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .

in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .

the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .

the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2004 countdown begins for cyprus reunification deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots marched under the cyprus flag proposed by the u.n. on monday .
u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.03.2004 unions threaten strike to prevent longer hours , same pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abcs of contract negotiation : teachers would be affected germany 's unions are vehemently opposed to plans for lengthening working hours without wage increases .
they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .
-lrb- march 8 , 2004 -rrb- could longer work hours revive the german economy ?
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .
but the talks in brussels have not kept ireland from slashing its corporate tax rate to 12.5 percent . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . "
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- german tradesmen look east as the countdown for eu expansion continues , many small and medium-sized german companies are growing increasingly fearful of the impending competition from across the borders .
but some firms can hardly wait .
-lrb- march 6 , 2004 -rrb- keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .

for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .
-lrb- march 19 , 2004 -rrb- german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .
-lrb- march 19 , 2004 -rrb- german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .

the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .

for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .

" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .
struck is confident he will be able to defend his budget against attempts by finance minister hans eichel to cut government spending wherever possible . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck : nato needs to stay in kosovo beyond 2006 german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2004 countdown begins for cyprus reunification deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots marched under the cyprus flag proposed by the u.n. on monday .
u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .
but the talks in brussels have not kept ireland from slashing its corporate tax rate to 12.5 percent . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.03.2004 countdown begins for cyprus reunification deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek and turkish cypriots marched under the cyprus flag proposed by the u.n. on monday .
u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .

the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .
-lrb- march 19 , 2004 -rrb- german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .
-lrb- march 19 , 2004 -rrb- german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .
struck is confident he will be able to defend his budget against attempts by finance minister hans eichel to cut government spending wherever possible . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck : nato needs to stay in kosovo beyond 2006 german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .

" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .
-lrb- march 8 , 2004 -rrb- could longer work hours revive the german economy ?
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.03.2004 unions threaten strike to prevent longer hours , same pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abcs of contract negotiation : teachers would be affected germany 's unions are vehemently opposed to plans for lengthening working hours without wage increases .
they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .
struck is confident he will be able to defend his budget against attempts by finance minister hans eichel to cut government spending wherever possible . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck : nato needs to stay in kosovo beyond 2006 german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- germany announces military cuts military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain .

for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live kick off !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.03.2004 ministers reach agreement in emissions fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german industry will soon have caps on carbon emissions .
germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .
-lrb- march 19 , 2004 -rrb- german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .

for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .

the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .

the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.03.2004 unions threaten strike to prevent longer hours , same pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abcs of contract negotiation : teachers would be affected germany 's unions are vehemently opposed to plans for lengthening working hours without wage increases .
they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .
such flexibility could also prevent firms from moving jobs overseas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .
-lrb- march 8 , 2004 -rrb- could longer work hours revive the german economy ?
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .
but the talks in brussels have not kept ireland from slashing its corporate tax rate to 12.5 percent . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .

as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses . german chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday there needed to be a " critical debate " over how to avoid tax competition between the old and new eu members .
he pointed to the fact that the average corporate tax level in the new member states was roughly 10 percent lower than in the old eu states . " this creates a competitive situation that is problematic for the current members of the european union , " schröder said according to the associated press . both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . " it 's at levels at which western europe can not compete with , " tax experts at the chancellery told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . hunting for companies a recent study by the cologne-based institute for the german economy -lrb- iw -rrb- said all of the new eu countries were taking an aggressive approach toward poaching western firms .
" low tax rates are , after small labor costs , the second most import reason for moving production to a new location , " iw economist winfried fuest said . the eu will expand in may to include poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , cyprus , malta , lithuania , latvia and estonia . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said this week said it was unacceptable that the eu was funding major development and infrastructure projects in the new member states while they used low corporate taxes to entice companies to abandon old eu countries . " it can not continue that we give these countries financial aid via the eu that they then use to keep their taxes low , " stoiber said at a regional meeting of his christian social union party . the calls by german politicians to combat the eastern european tax advantages comes on the heels of a firestorm ignited by comments made by ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , who recommended german companies should move jobs to low-wage former-communist eu countries . schröder and other members of his social democratic party called braun 's suggestion " unpatriotic " at a time when german unemployment hovers at 11 percent . despite germany 's concern , there is likely little the old eu members can do to keep eastern european countries from using low taxes to encourage foreign investment .
the current 15-member eu has haggled for years over implementing a minimum corporate tax level to curb competition for firms within the bloc .
but the talks in brussels have not kept ireland from slashing its corporate tax rate to 12.5 percent . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business booster to firms : go east the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .
-lrb- march 19 , 2004 -rrb- german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

german defense minister struck has said berlin will honor its commitment to purchase 180 eurofighter aircraft , ending speculation germany might renege on its order due to budgetary constraints . under the catchphrase ' bundeswehr in transformation , ' the german defense minister is currently engineering the biggest overhaul of the german armed forces in their 55-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck -lrb- photo -rrb- aims to radically change the face of the monolithic cold war standing army in an effort to get in shape for germany ’ s new security challenges such as anti-terror operations , conflict prevention and nation building . on tuesday , struck said military procurement and the pan-european eurofighter aircraft project are essential elements of the reform drive .
" germany sticks to its order of 180 eurofighter jets , " struck said .
" the first aircraft will come into operation this month .
we will also ask parliament for the completion of this aircraft with modern air-to-air missile systems when they will be available in 2006 . " ambitious military shopping spree struck thus ended speculation that germany might cut the most expensive arms deal in its history and reduce the order to 140 aircraft due to budgetary constraints . struck also announced that 60 wide-body a400m -lrb- photo -rrb- transport planes would be purchased as planned , as part of a european defense effort to boost military transport capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military plane airbus a 400 m the funding of the ambitious military projects , however , still remains unclear .
the eurofighter is expected to cost the government € 18 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- , while the a400m planes amount to € 8.3 billion . the defense minister ’ s military shopping plans include major investment in satellite-based military communication and surveillance as well as upgrading the equipment of soldiers on the ground . keeping up with partners in addition , struck also announced investments in the german armed forces of more than € 20 billion , which he hopes to finance by major troop reductions and scrapping outdated military hardware . projects that are to be shelved include purchasing a new navy helicopter and a new pilotless surveillance drone also for the navy .
all in all , struck hopes to be able to spend up to € 26 billion in new armaments , enabling germany to keep up with its partners in nato and europe . " the bundeswehr is on the right path to reach three essential goals , " struck said .
" first of all , we will create modern structures in the military . secondly , we will make contributions to the overall transformation of nato and the european defense effort , and thirdly , we will provide planning security for germany ’ s arms industry and for all of our bundeswehr staff . " national defense not sidelined germany ’ s highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , defended the defense minister on tuesday against accusations the new bundeswehr would neglect national defense . germany ’ s opposition conservatives have claimed the transformed armed forces would be unable to react efficiently to national emergencies and in the case of a terror attack at home .
they want to create a u.s.-style national guard to boost home defense . " these tasks have been taken very seriously by our planners , " schneiderhahn said .
" but we don ’ t need structures requiring the storage of enormous amounts of hardware for potential mobilization which would be too costly to maintain and upgrade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the defense minister ’ s spending spree , experts say , can only materialize when the planned reductions of 35,000 troops are really carried out , and the funds freed up by the reforms remain in the armed forces .
struck is confident he will be able to defend his budget against attempts by finance minister hans eichel to cut government spending wherever possible . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck : nato needs to stay in kosovo beyond 2006 german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .
firms need to be able to flexibly increase work hours to accomodate more productivity , he said .

they threatened to go on strike if necessary . " if we need to , we will fight , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told zdf television .
public servants ca n't always be called upon to fix the country 's budget problems , he said .
speaking in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder also voiced his opposition to a general extension of the working week to 40 or more hours .
he said he would prefer to find flexible solutions which take companies ' situations into consideration . in a meeting of state premiers last thursday on civil service work contracts , the heads of germany 's states agreed to extend working hours for western german civil servants , without pay increases .
the goal of the new contracts is to increase weekly working hours from 38.5 to at least 40 hours per week .
germany 's large civil service population includes teachers and hospital workers , as well as those directly employed directly in the government bureaucracy .
the plan comes at a time when germany is facing mounting pressure to restructure its costly labor market or stand by as jobs and investment move to the cheaper climates of eastern europe or asia . german workers already work the least number of hours for the most pay compared to their eastern european neighbors , according to a study by the cologne insitute for business research .
setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber to prevent job loss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , head of the conservative csu party , demanded a 40-hour work week without increased pay , saying public servants should set an example for private industry .
he also claimed the move would increase german productivity .
he went on to say he expects some german states to introduce a work week of up to 42 hours before the end of this year .
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the christian democratic union , also came out in favor of the longer hours .
one or two more hours a week would be the best way to increase competitiveness while securing incomes , he said .
unions , including verdi and the dgb trade union federation , think otherwise .
faulty concept speaking to the financial times deutschland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer newspaper , dgb 's sommer said lengthening working hours is basically a faulty concept .
" longer working hours destroy jobs , prevent new hiring , and reduce job opportunities for those who are out of work , " he said .
" lengthening working hours in the public sector would cut out more than 100,000 jobs " across the country .
he acknowledged that in exceptional cases , " short-term additional work hours could be the way for some companies to pull out of a crisis . "
over the weekend , verdi spokesman harald reitter said a 40 hour week without more pay comes down to workers taking a pay cut .
he also demanded an explanation as to how increased working hours could lead to more jobs .
he calculated that an increase to 42 working hours a week for civil service jobs would lead to the loss of 130,000 jobs country-wide .
the debate came about as a number of german states cancelled their civil service contracts last week .
in the new contract negotiations , not only working hours but also benefits - such as a thirteenth month of pay for christmas - will come under the lens .
even some ruling politicians are calling for new contracts .
one supporter of increased work hours is interior minister otto schily .
and german economics minister wolfgang clement said he does n't oppose the idea of longer working hours in germany in all cases .

germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions . german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin , locked in a months-long battle over the setting of carbon emissions caps on industries , finally reached a compromise on monday night . trittin said the two had agreed to allot companies carbon limits of up to 503 million tons by 2007 .
in a second phase , the emissions would be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 . the breakthrough came after chancellor gerhard schröder called several members of his cabinet to his office on monday to settle the long-running dispute over how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- the country should be allowed to discharge into the atmosphere . the emissions caps , introduced after adoption of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gases , are part of germany 's strategy to cut its co2 emissions by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin trittin , a member of the environmentalist green party , which is the junior partner in the governing coalition , originally wanted germany to cut emissions from 505 million tons -lrb- the emissions amount in 2000-2002 -rrb- to 488 million tons in the first phase of the plan during 2005-2007 . in the second phase , 2008-2012 , trittin wanted to cut further co2 emissions to 480 tons . clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had come down on the side of german industry and had been adamant about keeping levels at 505 million during the first phase . he said further emissions reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry , which is trying to shake off three years of economic stagnation .
he has insisted that requiring utilities and other energy-intensive companies to invest in emissions-reducing measures at this time would incur heavy costs on them , push energy prices higher and endanger the country 's nascent economic recovery . frank-walter steinmeyer , head of the federal chancellery , attempted to bring the two sides closer with a compromise suggestion of 499 million tons , but that figure was rejected by clement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder schröder had called clement and trittin , along with foreign minister joschka fischer and steinmeyer to the chancellery for a meeting monday night to settle the issue ahead of the eu 's wednesday deadline . emissions trading carbon dioxide is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted by industry and many scientists believe it is the main culprit behind global warming .
overall , the eu wants to cut 1990 co2 emissions by eight percent by 2012 .
to do that , the eu has set forth a two-pronged strategy : placing limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide industry and utilities can release into the atmosphere , and to implement an emissions trading system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from companies who have remained under their pollution caps .
at the start of 2005 , utility companies and certain industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - will be able to buy and sell emission credits .
they must first however apply for emissions certificates , which will allow them to release carbon dioxide in the first place .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 . but up to now , only eight countries are ready with their allocation plans .
these are the united kingdom , ireland , the netherlands , denmark , finland , austria , portugal and new member state latvia .
member states that miss the deadline will likely receive a " letter of formal notice " from the commission , anthony hobley , a senior associate in the climate change group of law firm baker & mckenzie in london , told bloomberg .
the commission will probably negotiate with member states before starting legal action , which would take as long as two years . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin locks horns over emission certificates one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers .

u.n. secretary-general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .
the parties have until march 31 to agree to the plan , which has sparked mixed feelings . kofi annan said he believed the peace plan would allow both sides to win as he handed over the 9,000-page document to the parties meeting in the swiss resort of bürgenstock .
the plan reworked by the u.n. secretary general and which is meant to allow a united cyprus to join the european union on may 1 , comes after six days of talks with greek and turkish cypriot negotiators . but the greek side reacted to the plan with dismay .
" he gave us a sandwich and a cup of coffee .
them -lrb- the turkish delegation -rrb- he gave a five-course meal with champagne , " a representative from the greek cypriot delegation told ap .
the turkish delegation , however , appeared pleased with the plan , some details of which have been leaked to the press . the plan is said to call for a republic led by a federal senate made up of six greek cypriots and three turkish cypriots .
elections to the body could take place as early as june . greek cypriot returnees restricted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots will continue to rule the northern part of the island , even after greek cypriots return .
fewer greek refugees - 18 percent of the turkish-cypriot population rather than 21 percent - will be allowed to return to their homes on the turkish part of the island .
the north will only be opened up to greek cypriots once the turkish cypriot per capita income more than triples , to 85 percent of the greek cypriot level . despite greek cypriot objections , turkish soldiers will be permitted to remain stationed on cyprus indefinitely , though their numbers will be limited to 650 if turkey joins the eu .
the turkish cypriot side had repeatedly expressed concern that the turkish minority would be overwhelmed by the greek cypriots . the plan reportedly does not respond to greek cypriot insistence that turkish settlers who moved to cyprus after 1974 be forced to leave .
instead 45,000 of them would be granted cypriot citizenship , while the remainder would be allowed to continue living on the island . the mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 , when turkey invaded the north in the wake of a greek cypriot coup that was backed by greece . deadline looms greek prime minister costas karamanlis and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogen , whose governments serve as guarantors to the negotiations , and their foreign ministers were also present for the talks in bürgenstock on tuesday .
the two leaders are said to be anxious for a successful end to the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan annan 's strict schedule for the cyprus talks gives the two sides until tuesday morning to respond to the suggestions , which include over 130 proposals for new laws in a united cyprus , and requires them to complete talks on wednesday . annan is to meet separately with the greek and turkish cypriot delegations later on tuesday to hear their views . if no agreement is reached by wednesday , annan will submit his own suggestion .
in any case , referenda on the topic will be held on both parts of the island on april 20 .
if either side rejects the proposal , unification will be put on ice .
the greek cypriot part of the island will then join the european union alone , and turkey will face a setback to its own efforts to accede to the eu . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek conservatives win election greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.03.2004 the gas station singer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu : a star in ghana and a car-washer in germany a service station in an industrial area of münster could n't be farther away from ghana .
for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

for bawa abudu , it 's a place where he can earn enough to feed his family - at least until the money matches his music 's acclaim . a gas station on a busy road that cuts through an industrial suburb of münster seems like a strange place to find an african prince and a popular ghanian musician .
but bawa abudu has proven so popular that drivers are lining up just to have him wash their cars , and passing motorists toot their horns , flash their headlights and wave .
the 51-year-old bawa , son of the chief of his tribe , originally came to germany in 1980 to purchase used agricultural equipment for the busanga people back in his hometown of tamale in northern ghana .
but his good language skills led to work with the british armed forces in münster , and he later married a german woman and started a family before eventually landing a job at the gas station .
reggae and recognition teaming up with jamaican-born british soldiers , bawa played in reggae bands and then began releasing recordings of his traditional music to widespread acclaim in ghana .
germans are slowly catching on to bawa 's music , and his new single " ayamayoto " was recently released by bmg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bawa abudu cd cover despite the acclaim , sales of his music in ghana and germany are not enough to support a family .
to the people of münster , bawa is known as the man who sings while washing cars at the local gas station .
for bawa , washing cars is just a way to pay the bills , while it also allows him to sing throughout the day .
bawa smiles as he reflects upon his musical success in ghana and says that it makes up for any sacrifices he has had to make in germany .
" each time i go home my music is played all over , especially in the northern part of ghana , where i was born , " he says .
" almost every child can sing my songs .
so i 'm loved there ...
i 'm great there , and i thank god that people really do like me .
here you 're not being recognized , but when you get home you feel like ... someone . "
carrying on the tradition featuring the thumb piano , guitar and african xylophone , bawa abudu 's music draws heavily upon his traditional roots .
but perhaps his biggest musical influence was his mother , who is the custodian of the busanga 's oral history .
" she had to sing the history of our tribe and pass it in music to other generations , and i grew up with this , " says bawa . " my mother was a very important figure in the tribe , and she has instilled a lot in me that i still have . "
carrying on the tradition of his mother , bawa writes about his tribe 's history and ancestors , but he also writes about the modern day problems they face .
" i write about our social problems , i write about our ancestors , i write about life in general and i also write about slavery , colonialism , depression , depravation and things of that sort , " he says . language is another important aspect of bawa 's music .
mainstream record company producers may make his songs more appealing for a mass market by adding electronic dance beats , but bawa insists on singing in his native hausa .
" i sing in hausa because the hausa language is the second most-widely spoken language in africa after swahili .
so by doing that , i catch a lot of people in africa , " he says . " people from south africa , people from other sides of africa all understand me . "
car wash crooning the exact meaning of his lyrics is often lost on the many germans who come to bawa to get their cars washed .
but regular customers , like karl kramer , are surprisingly big fans of the man and his music .
" i have to ask myself whether i 'm coming here for my car or my soul , " he confides .
" is my soul being cleansed or my car ?
i do n't know exactly . ...
he is a wonderful poet and singer . "
with loyal customers like that , it 's no wonder that the closest music store has run out of bawa 's latest cd four times in recent months .
but looking to the future , bawa hopes that one day he 'll be able to support his family entirely through his music and return to ghana to help establish kindergartens and a music studio .
" my biggest dream is to be able to establish a studio in ghana and to be able to sort out the young talent and help produce them and find a market for them in europe , " he says .
for now , at least , bawa is content with the stark contrasts in his life : respect for his work washing cars in germany and adulation for his music in ghana . guy degan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

citigroup recently predicted that hutchison would lose $ 2.6bn on 3g this year , slightly more than it lost in 2003 .

the food giant announced on monday that the jobs will go over an 18-month period at the plant , which makes easter eggs and quality street .
the move will turn halifax into a " high performing " site , the company said .
the transport and general workers ' union -lrb- t & g -rrb- plans to oppose the cuts , which nearly halve the workforce .
national officer brian revell said the announcement raised concerns over nestlé 's future intentions . "
halifax is responsible for some of the world 's best loved confectionery brands " paul graddon , factory manager " it seems clear that nestlé are working to a clear strategy of cutbacks and job losses in the uk .
he added that nestlé had now announced more than 400 job losses in the uk in the past few weeks .
factory manager paul graddon said the job losses did not reflect on the employees at the site .
" the proposed changes are about transforming halifax into a high-performing factory , making it a better place to work for everyone and building its long-term future .
" halifax is responsible for some of the world 's best loved confectionery brands . "
the factory , which was opened in 1964 , produces more than a million of tins of quality street and 25 million easter eggs every year .

privatisation of telstra , which could bring 30bn australian dollars -lrb- £ 12bn ; $ 22bn -rrb- into state coffers , has long been an aim of the current government .
but the opposition-dominated senate vetoed the plan , after rejecting it first last october .
left-wing senators fear the effect on services to remote rural areas .
providing telecoms services to the sparsely-populated hinterland is highly unprofitable , and the opposition fears a privatised utility will not maintain standards .
brinkmanship there is an element of politics to the senate 's decision , however .
the opposition labor party , currently riding high in the polls , hopes the government will exercise its right to dissolve parliament and call elections .
" if -lsb- prime minister -rsb- john howard wants to use this bill as a double dissolution trigger labor says bring it on , " labor communications spokesman lindsay tanner said .
the government passed up such an opportunity the last time the telstra bill was rejected , however , and is unlikely to take the bait this time .
the government has other options for telstra 's future , including spinning off non-core interests such as its stake in tv provider foxtel , or its sensis advertising unit e-mail this to a friend related to this story : senate inflicts telstra sale defeat -lrb- 30 oct 03 -pipe- business -rrb- australia clears path for telstra sale -lrb- 21 aug 03 -pipe- business -rrb- broadband growth hits telecoms giants -lrb- 21 feb 03 -pipe- business -rrb- telstra sell-off clears another hurdle -lrb- 08 nov 02 -pipe- business -rrb- australian telecom sell-off fiasco -lrb- 04 nov 02 -pipe- business -rrb- pccw ditches mobile ambitions -lrb- 01 jul 02 -pipe- business -rrb- australia sells sydney airport -lrb- 25 jun 02 -pipe- business -rrb- australia budgets for defence -lrb- 14 may 02 -pipe- business -rrb- related internet links : telstra australian senate the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

revenge in his testimony , the witness alleged that mr malik took him aside one day at the local sikh temple and asked him to drop a briefcase off at the vancouver airport .
he was told the case contained a time bomb and that it would destroy the plane that it was on .
the witness says he refused because of the number of innocent people it would kill .

the crew of a yacht will spend six months surveying hundreds of km of coastline , from cornwall to scotland .
the sharks , which are harmless , are still rare around the uk , and are under threat from several human activities .
they grow up to 12m -lrb- 38 ft -rrb- in length , can weigh seven tonnes , and have been known to live for 50 years .
but they feed on plankton , and the only real risk they pose to people is if they collide with boats .
the survey , a repeat of a similar voyage in 2003 , is being organised by the wildlife trusts .
the trusts ' project , supported by the national express group and the heritage lottery fund , involves the yacht forever changes sailing on 1 may to monitor likely shark sites from the western channel to the firth of clyde , northern ireland and the western isles of scotland .
long-distance travellers the survey is due to end in early october .
it aims to judge what threats the basking shark still faces , to identify individuals , and to help to establish population size and structure .
basking sharks are already known to travel considerable distances in search of food .
one of the main aims of the survey is to find out which areas are important feeding and breeding grounds for the sharks and if they return to the same places each year .
photo-identification and video recording carried out in previous surveys allows the team to track the movements and behaviour of individual sharks over long periods .
" hot spots " already identified include the area around land 's end , the lizard peninsula and the waters off plymouth in the south west ; the isle of man ; strangford lough ; the isle of arran ; and the hebrides .
the trusts say recent studies by cefas -lrb- the uk 's centre for environment , fisheries and aquaculture science -rrb- using satellite tags have shown the sharks tend to move out to deeper water outside the summer months , when they are most likely to be seen close inshore .
the survey team is keen to identify not only where the sharks congregate to feed , but also where they mate : the frequent courtship behaviour observed off the lizard suggests this may be an important breeding area .
the sharks are protected within uk territorial waters , though some of the legislation does not cover scottish and northern irish waters .
last year 's survey covered 3,695 km -lrb- 2,295 miles -rrb- and sighted 108 sharks .

the crew of a yacht will spend six months surveying hundreds of km of coastline , from cornwall to scotland .
the sharks , which are harmless , are still rare around the uk , and are under threat from several human activities .
they grow up to 12m -lrb- 38 ft -rrb- in length , can weigh seven tonnes , and have been known to live for 50 years .
but they feed on plankton , and the only real risk they pose to people is if they collide with boats .
the survey , a repeat of a similar voyage in 2003 , is being organised by the wildlife trusts .
the trusts ' project , supported by the national express group and the heritage lottery fund , involves the yacht forever changes sailing on 1 may to monitor likely shark sites from the western channel to the firth of clyde , northern ireland and the western isles of scotland .
long-distance travellers the survey is due to end in early october .
it aims to judge what threats the basking shark still faces , to identify individuals , and to help to establish population size and structure .
basking sharks are already known to travel considerable distances in search of food .
one of the main aims of the survey is to find out which areas are important feeding and breeding grounds for the sharks and if they return to the same places each year .
photo-identification and video recording carried out in previous surveys allows the team to track the movements and behaviour of individual sharks over long periods .
" hot spots " already identified include the area around land 's end , the lizard peninsula and the waters off plymouth in the south west ; the isle of man ; strangford lough ; the isle of arran ; and the hebrides .
the trusts say recent studies by cefas -lrb- the uk 's centre for environment , fisheries and aquaculture science -rrb- using satellite tags have shown the sharks tend to move out to deeper water outside the summer months , when they are most likely to be seen close inshore .
the survey team is keen to identify not only where the sharks congregate to feed , but also where they mate : the frequent courtship behaviour observed off the lizard suggests this may be an important breeding area .

aol won the car - a $ 47,000 boxster s - as part of a court settlement against an unnamed e-mailer last year .
" we 'll take cars , houses , boats - whatever we can find and get a hold of , " said aol 's randall boe .
according to mr boe , the porsche 's previous owner made more than $ 1m by sending junk e-mail .
hitting them where it hurts aol is one of the noisiest opponents of the evasive spam trade , and this month joined forces with microsoft , yahoo and earthlink to sue hundreds of spammers .
seizure of property is becoming a major tactic in these lawsuits , since guilty spammers often protest their inability to pay large fines .
the porsche-owning spammer , whose identity remains confidential , was one of a group sued last year for having sent 1 billion junk messages to aol members , pitching pornography , college degrees , cable tv descramblers and other products .
mr boe said the porsche was seized mainly for its symbolic value , as the obvious fruit of an illegal trade .
the porsche sweepstake lasts until 8 april , and will be open only to those who were aol members when it was first announced .

it says the problem is now as serious as sea level rise , over-fishing , water shortages and inadequate sanitation ; and may be putting off many tourists .
unep is helping the island states to deal with their waste , but acknowledges much more should , and could , be done .
it cites the example of the pacific island of nauru , which now has a blue-green shoreline - not from the colour of the sea , but because of the mounds of discarded beer cans which disfigure its beaches .
unsightly problem unep says the throw-away society threatens people 's health , encouraging pests like rats which spread disease .
it also helps to undermine livelihoods , as tourists are less likely to return to a rubbish-strewn paradise .
a short walk along any coastline close to human habitation in the pacific islands will reveal many examples of inappropriate waste disposal unep released several reports on the problems of small island developing states -lrb- which it calls sids -rrb- during the annual meeting here of its governing council , which ends on 31 march .
dr klaus toepfer , unep 's executive director , said : " small islands across the caribbean , indian ocean and the pacific are some of the most vulnerable nations on earth .
" they are threatened by global warming in the guise of more extreme weather events and rising sea levels , and their water supplies are often restricted .
" many are also found in remote locations and have limited natural resources , which in turn makes them economically vulnerable .
" handling solid wastes from industry , households and tourism is emerging as another issue with which they need advice and help .
such wastes are not only unsightly and a threat to wildlife ; they can also contaminate rivers and groundwater as they slowly degrade . "
solid issue unep and other un agencies and waste experts have been helping the islanders to face the waste problem .
but dr toepfer said : " we need to do much more right across the range of wastes if we are to ensure a clean , healthy and sustainable environment for the citizens of these states . "
unep 's reports on the waste problem were compiled by its global programme of action for the protection of the marine environment from land-based activities and its global international waters assessment .
they make clear that what happens to rubbish and litter is only part of a wider waste crisis : caribbean islands discharge 90 % of their wastewater untreated , and in parts of the north-east pacific the level of untreated sewage is 98 % .
and the reports say the provision of facilities for disposing of waste often leaves " social attitudes " unchanged .
one report says : " a short walk along any coastline close to human habitation in the pacific islands will reveal many examples of inappropriate waste disposal , even in areas where there is a municipal collection system such as the city of suva , in fiji . "
another says " the most critical issue " for island states in the indian ocean is disposing of solid wastes .

the uk has the highest self-harm rates in europe .
one in 10 teenagers deliberately hurts themselves and 24,000 are admitted to hospital each year .
the inquiry , organised by the mental health foundation and the camelot foundation , will examine why the numbers are so high .
the two-year inquiry will be chaired by catherine mcloughlin cbe .
she is a former deputy chief nursing officer and current chairwoman of the nurses ' welfare service .
high rates rates of self-harm in the uk have increased sharply over the past decade .
the most common method of self-harm involves repeatedly cutting the skin , but others include burning , scalding , hitting or scratching , hair pulling or swallowing small amounts of toxic substances to cause discomfort or damage . "
the task facing us is to understand why more young people seem to be harming themselves " catherine mcloughlin , inquiry chairwoman the average age for children starting to self-harming is 13 years old , but children as young as seven have been found to self-harm .
certain groups of young people are more susceptible to self-harming , such as young asian women and young female prisoners .
whilst young women outnumber young men in the ratio of seven to one , rates of self-harm among young men and boys have almost doubled since the 1980s .
" self-harm among young people is an issue that is much-debated , but we lack a proper understanding of it , and have a limited capacity to respond effectively in the areas of policy and services , " said ms mcloughlin .
" the task facing us is to understand why more young people seem to be harming themselves , how we can engage with them , and above all , what we can do to help . "
stress susan elizabeth , director of the camelot foundation said the stress of modern life was often thought to blame .
she told bbc breakfast : " it seems the more stresses that young people have in their lives the more it seems they are turning to self-harm as a way of dealing with those stresses . "
she said the inquiry would take the views of young people into account .
" one of our key priorities for the national inquiry is that it should reflect the views and experience of young people who self-harm .
" to achieve this , we will be consulting regularly with five sites across the uk , where groups of young people who self-harm already meet . " " it was only when i looked on the internet and had private counselling that i started to improve " katie foulser katie foulser , 20 , used to cut herself up to 10 times a day .
she has since set up the self harm alliance to provide a resource for other young people .
" there was little help available , " she said .
" i went to my gp and she was quite supportive .
but it was only when i looked on the internet and had private counselling that i started to improve . "
dr andrew mcculloch , chief executive of the mental health foundation , said : " the increase in self-harm is one of a number of indicators in the mental health field that show something is wrong .
" it may be visible evidence of growing problems facing our young people , or of a growing inability to respond to those problems .
" there is a desire across the health and social care spectrum to develop appropriate responses , but the evidence base is limited .
self-harm is a complex issue , and our inquiry will have to be broad in its outlook . "

the task facing us is to understand why more young people seem to be harming themselves catherine mcloughlin , inquiry chairwoman the average age for children starting to self-harming is 13 years old , but children as young as seven have been found to self-harm .
certain groups of young people are more susceptible to self-harming , such as young asian women and young female prisoners .
whilst young women outnumber young men in the ratio of seven to one , rates of self-harm among young men and boys have almost doubled since the 1980s .
" self-harm among young people is an issue that is much-debated , but we lack a proper understanding of it , and have a limited capacity to respond effectively in the areas of policy and services , " said ms mcloughlin .
" the task facing us is to understand why more young people seem to be harming themselves , how we can engage with them , and above all , what we can do to help . "
stress susan elizabeth , director of the camelot foundation said the stress of modern life was often thought to blame .
she told bbc breakfast : " it seems the more stresses that young people have in their lives the more it seems they are turning to self-harm as a way of dealing with those stresses . "
she said the inquiry would take the views of young people into account .
" one of our key priorities for the national inquiry is that it should reflect the views and experience of young people who self-harm .
" to achieve this , we will be consulting regularly with five sites across the uk , where groups of young people who self-harm already meet . " it was only when i looked on the internet and had private counselling that i started to improve katie foulser katie foulser , 20 , used to cut herself up to 10 times a day .
she has since set up the self harm alliance to provide a resource for other young people .
" there was little help available , " she said .
" i went to my gp and she was quite supportive .
but it was only when i looked on the internet and had private counselling that i started to improve . "
dr andrew mcculloch , chief executive of the mental health foundation , said : " the increase in self-harm is one of a number of indicators in the mental health field that show something is wrong .
" it may be visible evidence of growing problems facing our young people , or of a growing inability to respond to those problems .
" there is a desire across the health and social care spectrum to develop appropriate responses , but the evidence base is limited .
self-harm is a complex issue , and our inquiry will have to be broad in its outlook . "

bbc news online looks back at his long and respected career .
for more than half a century , alistair cooke 's weekly broadcasts of letter from america for bbc radio monitored the pulse of life in the united states and relayed its strengths and weaknesses to 50 countries .
his retirement from the show earlier this month after 58 years , due to ill health , brought a flood of tributes for his huge contributing to broadcasting .
born in salford , near manchester , northern england , alistair cooke 's father was an iron-fitter and methodist lay-preacher .
alistair cooke : consummate broadcaster winning a scholarship to jesus college , cambridge he read english , edited the undergraduate magazine , granta , and founded the cambridge university mummers .
alistair cooke made his first visit to the united states in 1932 , on a commonwealth fund fellowship which took him to both yale and harvard universities .
following his return to britain , he became the bbc 's film critic and , in 1935 , london correspondent for america 's national broadcasting corporation .
he returned to the united states in 1937 to work as a commentator on american affairs for the bbc .
he made his home there and , in 1941 , became an american citizen .
a passion for jazz march 1946 saw the first edition of american letter , which became letter from america in 1949 .
the series was the longest-running series in history to be presented by a single person .
alistair cooke never decided what he was going to talk about until he wrote the script , made no notes during the preceding week and preferred to rely on his memory .
in an interview given at the time of the 3,000th edition of letter from america , he appeared to have mixed feelings about the future of the united states .
" in america , " he said , " the race is on between its decadence and its vitality , and it has lots of both . "
he addressed congress in 1973 cooke led his listeners through the american vicissitudes of korea , kennedy , vietnam , watergate , nixon 's resignation and clinton 's scandals .
in all of this , cooke pulled no punches .
the lyricism of his broadcasting and the urbanity of his voice did not disguise his fears for america which he saw becoming a more violent society .
a liberal by nature , he reserved particular dislike for what he saw as the shallow flag-waving of the reagan presidency .
alongside working for the bbc and the guardian , for which he wrote from 1945 to 1972 , he developed a passion for jazz and golf and , as a film critic , he mixed with hollywood stars .
as a commentator on history , cooke was sometimes an eyewitness too .
he was just yards away from senator bobby kennedy when the latter was assassinated in 1968 .
he was never as comfortable on television as radio but , by the 1970s , his hugely successful television series america recounted his personal history of his adopted homeland and won international acclaim , two emmy awards and spawned a million-selling book .
british or american ?
the queen awarded him an honorary knighthood in 1973 and the following year , for a journalist , he received the ultimate recognition - he was asked to address the united states congress on its 200th anniversary .
he told his audience he felt as if he was in a dream , standing naked before them and there was only one thing he could find to say .
teasing , he exclaimed to the assembled legislators , " i gratefully accept your nomination for president of the united states ! "
naturally , he brought the house down .
many britons thought he was american , but to the americans he was the quintessential brit , the man who brought them the best of british television as presenter of masterpiece theatre .
for his part , he explained , " i feel totally at home in both countries . "
he impressed both audiences with his high quality work .
with his unquenchable curiosity , alistair cooke remained for decades the consummate broadcaster , an elegant writer and a man of enormous wit and charm who made sense of the american century .

teasing , he exclaimed to the assembled legislators , " i gratefully accept your nomination for president of the united states ! "
naturally , he brought the house down .
many britons thought he was american , but to the americans he was the quintessential brit , the man who brought them the best of british television as presenter of masterpiece theatre .
for his part , he explained , " i feel totally at home in both countries . "
he impressed both audiences with his high quality work .
with his unquenchable curiosity , alistair cooke remained for decades the consummate broadcaster , an elegant writer and a man of enormous wit and charm who made sense of the american century .

the number of pupils attending grammar schools has risen under the labour government , official figures show .
this is mainly due to the redesignation of eight schools as grammar schools in 1998 , the year after labour came to power .
but grammars have maintained their popularity , with the country 's 164 schools expanding to take in another 9,873 students .
more than 150,000 children are now educated at wholly selective state schools compared to just under 118,000 in 1983 .
are grammar schools a good thing ?
or are they socially divisive ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of the opinions we have received : it all comes down to money at the end of the day sam , bucks , uk our town has a grammar school one end and a secondary modern the other .
however , it is a well known fact that children who attend the state middle schools have a very slim chance of getting in , unless parents can afford 11 + tutoring , which is too expensive for a lot of ordinary parents .
therefore the majority of -lrb- ex-private school -rrb- children at our local grammar school are brought in from other more affluent areas by coach , paid for by our rising council taxes while all the other schools constantly struggle to raise funds , sending home letters on a regular basis asking parents for money for equipment etc .
the last ofsted report noted that although friendly , the grammar school did not reflect the community it was in .
of course it would n't , because hardly any children from the community attends it .
it all comes down to money at the end of the day .
sam , bucks , uk i wonder how recently the people who have replied so far have been in a school .
yes , the comprehensive system can work , but only if the behaviour of the pupils allow it to happen .
as a teacher i have had many of my classes disrupted by pupils who are unwilling to work or let anyone else work .
whilst dealing with these pupils the rest of the class are missing valuable teaching time .
this is happening more and more frequently with social inclusion and the disrespect that has become the norm from pupils and parents .
of course this is not so in all cases , but unfortunately it is happening more and more frequently .
so-called ' bright ' pupils will eventually succeed , but mainly by their own efforts guided by teachers despite what type of school they go to .
shirley , west sussex as a trainee teacher , i would be horrified if my younger brother , who is about to start secondary school , attended any of the local comprehensives which spend most of the time dealing with the troublesome pupils and leaving behind the unassuming hardworking ones .
my brother worked hard to pass the entrance examination for a local selective secondary school and i believe he should be rewarded for that by being taught in an environment where he will be pushed to achieve his full potential .
george , liverpool , uk it is not the name of the school but the standard that matters .
i failed my 11 + and went to a good secondary modern school where i was groomed to take the entrance examination for the local excellent technical college .
i am now a european engineer , chartered engineer and a graduate .
all through my education i was lucky to have excellent teachers who knew their subjects and could teach .
it is a shame that people worry about a name and not the main criteria , how good the teachers are .
thomas d. jago , khobar , saudi arabia if as a society we valued technical education as much as we valued academic achievement , grammar schools or grammar streams would have their place .
irene fletcher , hull , uk i do n't understand why people are saying that grammar schools are socially divisive .
i went to a grammar school and i think they encourage more mixing between backgrounds .
it is state education and is available to all , regardless of income .
but you also get those who are at the wealthier end of the spectrum who otherwise would have gone to a private school .
comprehensives will still have some division based on income because it depends whether you can afford a home with the correct postcode .
adam , ripon is it selfish to want my child to reach his potential ?
lisa , london if only we had a grammar school locally !
i 'm a single parent on a low income with a very bright child , iq 145 , yet the only school i can get him into is the one nearest to our council estate .
he has to struggle in a class where the teachers need to spend time with children learning at a much slower pace .
is that fair ?
is it selfish to want my child to reach his potential ?
lisa , london the real divide in education , and one that affects society in general , and life-chances for young people in particular , is that between the private and maintained sectors .
compared with that , the grammar / comprehensive debate is a side-show .
tony roake , west sussex i went to a comprehensive school , and was constantly distracted by the ' bad element ' who did n't want to learn .
luckily , most of them had been expelled towards the end .
i often think that i could have left school with better qualifications , if i was sent to school with kids who actually wanted to learn .
james , dorset , uk being in a grammar school yet having experienced both comprehensive and private education , i know that the children who are more academically able benefit the greatest when with others of their intellectual capacity so they can share ideas and inspire each other .
sometimes if put in a class with people with less motivation , that child does not achieve their full potential .
people need to realise that one type of education does not fit all children and that if a child is academically able , they should be given the opportunity to develop that .
anita , london the comprehensive system enabled me to reach my potential at a later age john , surrey i would have failed the 11 plus miserably at such a young age .
the comprehensive system enabled me to reach my potential at a later age and enabled me to excel in science , eventually leading to graduation from university with a degree in physics .
john , surrey we need to put more effort into helping comprehensive schools raise their standards rather than providing a system that creams the brightest and forgets the rest .
tl , cleveland i recently , got offers from two of the country 's leading grammar schools , for my a-level courses , after studying at a comprehensive all my life .
i chose to apply , because i felt the need to spend more time with people of the same academic ability and motivation as myself , and i think grammar schools , allow pupils a chance for this .
i think that for this reason , we need to allow pupils to be able to have this opportunity .
jm , uk i think that a tiered education system reflects and supports the diverse abilities of the population .
can it be wrong for society to demand more from the most capable ?
can it be wrong to tailor the education service to the abilities of a child ?
i think not .
terence summers , andover , england i went to a comprehensive and did very well academically , but that was only because the school streamed children of different abilities and taught them separately .
i dread to think what it would have been like without the streaming .
so i can see that for some children , there is a need to be taught in a challenging environment like in a grammar school .
bilal patel , london , uk comprehensives should be made to work but the only way this can happen is by streaming diane , halifax comprehensives should be made to work but the only way this can happen is by streaming - something avoided in this pc age .
by grading pupils the brightest can be challenged and those with greater needs helped more or even better allowed to excel in other areas such as sport or music .
one of my local schools strives to find something that all pupils are good at so they are not left out .
diane , halifax they are socially divisive .
grammar schools , prospects of a ' better ' education are making people even more elitist and prone to take care of no.1 without a thought for anyone else .
it 's just another index of the selfishness in our culture .
neil , uk grammars should have been abolished in 1997 when labour returned to power , completing the abolition scheme that was started in the late 1970s .
as a labour party member , i feel disgusted and disillusioned .
what party do i vote for to rid our country of these divisive , elitist institutions ?
just how big a majority do labour want before they do the right thing ?
nick james , bexley , kent i went to a grammar school having moved from bedfordshire , where the 11 + is not used .
a lot of the other kids in my grammar school had been to junior schools that coach the pupils especially to pass the 11 + .
i had never been put under pressure to succeed , so the whole process was much less stressful for me than my classmates .
ben , leeds , uk between " socially divisive " and mediocre , guess which one i , as well as most parents and students themselves , would choose ?
hugh , london , uk my husband failed his 11 + but eventually obtained a masters degree in law jane , uk my husband failed his 11 + but eventually obtained a masters degree in law .
this goes to show how stupid it is to try to put labels on children at such a young age .
jane , uk but what about if you 're not ' clever ' ?
do our cleverest students go on to become teachers ?
of course not , they go where the profiles are high and the salaries too .
so what about if you 're not ' clever , ' then ?
should these students just stay at home , produce children and watch trisha ?
neil , uk no !
there should be better resourcing for state schooling , with internal streaming to separate capabilities .
the idea of a grammar education merely creates a class division .
the sad decline of state education is rather a result of social and educational policy .
graham , uk why , oh why do we still have this debate .
it is n't comprehensives good / bad , grammar bad / good .
it is about ability .
able pupils attain more if they are surrounded by other able pupils - so win / win .
less able pupils get turned off if they are mixed with ' swots ' and so lose / lose .
john , cheshire i went to a state school which had excellent teachers .
i ended up passing my gcse 's , passing my a levels and going on to university to study law .
i think it is very ignorant to think that state schools are of a lower class of academic establishment next to a grammar school .
teachers are the key , not the school .
in a day where we have to teach our children social and racial tolerance , all children regardless of class background should learn together .
gareth , runcorn , cheshire we should go back to the old methods of grammar and secondary modern sandy , uk we should go back to the old methods of grammar and secondary modern .
when will people accept that some children are cleverer than others and need to be pushed more .
one size fits all will never work in any form of education .
sandy , uk can someone explain why grammar schools should be abolished to be replaced by comprehensives with streaming by ability ?
i ca n't really see the difference .
children all know which the ' top ' streams are .
how does that make those in the lower streams feel ?
not much different than those who do n't pass the 11 + , i would think .
i do n't think the children are that bothered anyway , it 's the parents ' who complain about feeling second class .
sali , uk grammar schools provide social mobility for the poor and should be encouraged .
discouraging excellence has never made things fairer - it has just made things generally worse .
frank church , london , england let us stop pretending that one size fits all and that all people are the same rob , yorks , uk i am a teacher in a comprehensive school and i send my children to a private school due to a lack of grammar schools in this area .
we must increase their numbers to allow clever young people to be pushed with their peers in an elite academic environment .
the comprehensive experiment has failed to the detriment of many thousands .
let us stop pretending that one size fits all and that all people are the same .
rob , yorks , uk is sense dawning in education at last ?
when i went to a grammar school in the 60 's and then on to cambridge i still kept in contact with primary school friends who went to secondary modern schools .
many of the secondary moderns schools were adding sixth forms before labour got in with their dogma and destroyed a perfectly good system .
roger jackson , stockport , england i went to a grammar school in trafford , a local authority that has been stubbornly selective for decades .
because my school was smaller we lacked some of the facilities of the larger secondary moderns .
physical education was particularly limited .
i grew up in the north west yet never once played rugby at school !
i am thankful though that i got to study the 3 sciences separately instead of them being lumped together into " science " .
oliver richardson , usa to separate kids like this at 11 creates divisions that last a lifetime douglas , milton keynes , uk why should the majority of decent kids who are different shades of average be consigned to second rate schools with no discipline or standards , and on top of that have to bear the brunt of peer pressure from that sector of society that nobody wants their kids hanging around with ?
to separate kids like this at 11 creates divisions that last a lifetime - great for those who get in , disastrous for those who do n't .
douglas , milton keynes , uk arbitrary separation in different schools leads on to arbitrary , and divisive , separation in adult life .
friends and acquaintances made at school often continue into later life .
mixing with the full community spectrum at school leads to a fuller understanding of the community , and each other , as adults .
while separation into different classes according to educational needs is necessary within a school for some subjects such separation does not prevent social interaction outside class .
having separate schools guarantees that social interaction will not occur resulting in split societies the results of which are so plain for all to see here in the uk and elsewhere .
john m , lynemeads , uk yes , they are a good thing .
as a secondary school teacher one of the most frustrating things is not being able to give enough time to kids who find things difficult and also not being able to stretch the high attainers enough .
there simply is n't enough time or support in the classroom and anyone who thinks otherwise should try teaching for a week or so before making any comments !
ben , bristol , uk build more grammar schools .
make them available to everyone who has the ability to go , regardless of ' social class ' .
entrance should n't be based on an entrance exam , it should be based on a portfolio of the child 's work .
this will stop ' well off ' parents fiddling the system by hiring exam tutors .
amanda , england it should be within the capabilities of schools to cater for all levels pauline fothergill , halifax , uk grammar schools should be abolished and the comprehensive system made to work .
if there were no grammar schools creaming off the brightest children , and they were integrated into schools catering for all abilities , secondary schools would improve .
it should be within the capabilities of schools to cater for all levels , albeit with suitable streaming .
this way no child would be left feeling a failure at 11 if he or she failed to gain a place at a selective school .
pauline fothergill , halifax , uk i went to a grammar school in the 60s which merged to become a comprehensive whilst i was there .
it was sad to see the demoralisation of some of the more academic teacher who were used to teaching ' higher ' streams and could not handle none academic pupils .
this despite the fact that the new school had the best and most modern facilities .
my elder son is dyslexic but very good at maths .
at his grammar school he has been for all sorts of maths challenges and inter-school competitions which have greatly improved his academic confidence .
i 'm not sure this would have happened at his local comprehensive .
anonymous life is socially divisive - just make the best of what you 've got .
we need to raise standards in our comprehensive schools to the standard of the grammar schools .
pay teachers who are prepared to work with less able children more money as they have to work much harder to get good results .
veejay , england my dad went to a grammar school in the 1940s / 50s .
many boys in his form were from mining villages and were very poor indeed .
however , owing to the fact that they did not have to pay for their grammar school education -lrb- it was free in those days -rrb- , four of the boys in his form were able to take full advantage of the grammar school system and eventually went on to gain phds .
bring back grammar schools and make them free of fees ; if children are clever enough to pass an entrance exam , they are clever enough to have their fees paid .
liz , lancs , uk grammar schools really are not the issue - choice is .
i would abolish state education , let schools operate in a market -lrb- and there will then be a school for all tastes -rrb- , give parents vouchers to spend and if schools charge above the voucher value , make independent schools earn their charitable status by subsidising poorer entrants .
all types of school co-exist happily in the independent sector , so the challenge is to give all parents this choice .
hj , berks , uk let the brightest be taught alongside each other caz , uk i went to a grammar school and my sister went to a state comprehensive .
the comprehensive school had occurrences such as teenage pregnancies , drug abuse and teacher bullying .
i did not experience anything like this , and used to be totally shocked when my sister came home and told me about them .
if parents want their children to take the test and get into a school where education is the priority , and pride in both yourselves and your surroundings is first and foremost , then why should n't they encourage their children to go to the grammar schools ?
let the brightest be taught alongside each other , they can only benefit from this , as well as the higher standard of teaching that the grammar school system instils .
caz , uk at our primary school we had the option of taking the 11-plus to get into grammar school , or just going to the local comprehensive .
my sister was a slow developer , and still found reading difficult at 11 .
there is no way she would have passed the 11-plus .
she went to the comprehensive and came out with 8 gcses at c or above , 2 a-levels and 2 as-levels -lrb- all grades a-c -rrb- .
she has since went on to obtain a 2i at a " proper " university .
this would never have happened had she failed the 11-plus and gone to the secondary modern .
comprehensives allow flexibility and movement between classes of different levels .
i guess we were lucky though in that our local comprehensive was a very good school .
katherine , london , uk i went to a grammar school from 1992-1999 .
although the school was selective it was wholly on tests , no-one paid to be there .
as with everything it 's creating the right learning environment , i liked being pushed to achieve whereas others will rebel against it .
i was academically strong so it suited me , whereas my brother -lrb- had he attended the same school -rrb- would have hated it cause he is more creative .
the only problem is that grammar schools is that the teachers do drum into you that you are better all the time and this can become socially divisive .
if this is stopped and it is just seen as a more academic option then there is nothing wrong with grammar school .
helen w , uk i went to a basic comprehensive , then non-selective sixth form college , then cambridge university .
at my school all classes were streamed after about the first year , so the more academically minded kids got more academic stimulation , and kids less academically inclined got what they needed too .
being in a school with children of different backgrounds and academic abilities gave me a view of a massive cross section of society and abilities and i would n't have had it any other way .
i think that going to a grammar school would have robbed me of a valuable experience .
katherine , london , uk not only would i not increase the number of grammar schools i would in fact abolish them along with private schools and force all children to go to state run schools .
this would help to prevent a long term elite appearing in society where the rich remain rich by depriving the poor .
at the very least it will mean the children of the rich / powerful -lrb- who generally end up rich / powerful -rrb- will have to , at least for their formative years , understand and mix with a broader range of society 's offerings .
graham smith , southampton , uk yes .
i failed my 11 plus but still got into university .
-lrb- i 'm reading a phd right now . -rrb-
grammar schools help some children and encourages those who do n't get in to work harder , just to prove that that test did n't mean a thing .
getting rid of grammars will not stop some kids being lazy or not working hard enough .
alexander hay , uk i grew up in n. ireland and went to a selective state grammar school .
while i was not at the top of the class , it allowed those with differing abilities to be streamed into a classroom environment that best suited their needs .
my school was composed of kids from a wide variety of social backgrounds - there purely on merit .
i got a good education i probably would have had to pay for on the " mainland " .
karl , leeds i went to a grammar school in the late 60 's .
it meant i had to leave behind a lot of friends and then you had parents who felt their children were somehow " superior " to those going to other schools .
today this is even more apparent with the number of parents being even more snobby in their views .
it is also a fact that many parents pay for tuition to get their children into grammar schools , so they are not necessarily the brightest , simply they have the money for tutoring .
i think all schools should be renamed grammar schools and the ks2 test used to place them in appropriate classes , rather than any form of selective test .

viewers have voted only fools and horses as britain 's favourite sitcom .
the winner was announced in a live final on bbc two , with blackadder in second place and the vicar of dibley a surprise third .
votes have been taken since january , when the bbc asked the public to nominate their favourite from a list of 10 including dad 's army , fawlty towers , open all hours , the good life and porridge .
was only fools and horses right to win ?
what is your favourite sitcom ?
what is the funniest sitcom moment ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments it beggars belief that the vicar of dibley made the top 100 , let alone came 3rd paul , cardiff although black adder will always be my favourite , everyone knew ' .. fools and horses ' would win .
despite the fact that some of the recent christmas specials have been poor , there are so many classic moments from it , that it could never have been beaten .
and whilst fawlty towers and blackadder are fantastic , they seem removed and surreal , whilst del and rodders could be people from up the road .
so many of the top ten though , display the wonder and originality of british comedy , that it beggars belief that the vicar of dibley made the top 100 , let alone came 3rd .
paul , cardiff i totally agree with michael samuel of wolverhampton .
blackadder is by far the funniest sitcom .
only fools & horses is a classic , but really a classic soap / comedy .
people love the trotters , but just because they are popular it does not mean that they are the funniest .
anyone who is intelligent enough to understand sarcasm & appreciate truly great comedy will agree that blackadder is the true winner , with fawlty towers a close second !
as for the vicar of dibley , i would rather eat one of baldrick 's toe-nails than watch it - it simply is not funny .
shaun , stanwick , northants , england i wonder how many of you moaning about the result actually bothered to register your own vote ?
i do n't like only fools and horses myself , but the bbc would n't show endless repeats and del boy specials if nobody was watching them -lrb- or would they ? -rrb- .
i 'm amazed fawlty towers did n't fare better , and i 'd watch repeats of red dwarf , blackadder and drop the dead donkey any day , but these appeal to a more limited audience than the likes of only fools and vicar of dibley .
kat , derby what a stupid question !
how can you possibly choose one ?
there 's so many truly excellent ones : only fools and horses , dad 's army , steptoe and son , ' til death us do part , rise and fall of rp , rising damp , the good life , men behaving badly , etc .
sadly open all hours ruins itself by legalising making fun of people who stammer .
it is not funny in any way to stammer .
dave deacon , england dad 's army can not be beaten for the sheer genius of the script writing coupled with the brilliant cast .
every episode is a gem .
it still appeals to young and old alike and is the best sitcom ever produced .
david griffiths , bexhill , east sussex my top 5:1 .
fawlty towers 2 .
only fools and horses 3 .
porridge 4 .
blackadder 5 .
open all hours tim nicholson , herne bay i can accept only fools and horses coming first it 's a great comedy regardless of the more recent episodes although i think blackadder really should have won .
but i 'm still really blown away at vicar of dibley coming third , how did it beat classics like dad 's army and fawlty towers ?
it 's unbelievable that such an unfunny , crime against comedy got into the top ten let alone the third best british comedy of all time .
michael samuel , wolverhampton , england was dreading that only fools would win ... it passed its sell by date about six specials and three seasons ago mike toone , derby , uk i must be the only person in the country to find ' ofah ' boring then .
the jokes can be seen a mile off , and really are n't very funny at all .
it 's nice to see blackadder coming so high , its truly intelligent writing , and brilliant comic performances deserve to be number one .
and surely it 's time for a repeat of yes minister ?
with the current political landscape , we need some good satire .
emma , london i was dreading that only fools would win , not that i do n't like it , but it passed its sell by date about six specials and three seasons ago .
consistence-wise it should have been either blackadder ; porridge ; open all hours or dad 's army .
i 'm still bemused how the vicar of dibley made it to number 3 - divine intervention i think .
miketoone , derby , uk i was honestly surprised when fawlty towers and yes , minister went out of the running quite so early on .
i was still optimistic that my favourite - the hilarious , witty and comical blackadder , stood a chance of winning .
alas , it was not to be !
on a positive note , the night showed what a wonderfully varied repertoire of situation comedy we have the joy to watch in great britain !
kirsty-jacqueline lingard , edinburgh all i can say is where was steptoe and son ?
andrew burns , st marys , usa blackadder not winning was as poor a choice as bad as butch oscar wilde , father of 20 children and author of the pamphlet ' why i like to do it with girls ' being sent down for being a whoopsie ed , london , uk what about the thin blue line ? - excellent comedy .
of the 10 , i would have voted for blackadder .
thomas wirshup , portland oregon usa all i can say is where was steptoe and son ?
andrew burns , st marys , georgia , usa i believe fawlty towers is consistently the best british sitcom .
ofah is brilliant but ft filmed 12 nuggets of gold while latterly ofah has been hit and miss .
paul reid , hamilton , scotland the early years were great , but spare us another christmas special !
it should have been off to the glue factory years ago .
the beeb are the only fools flogging us dead horses .
dave .
chris giles , reading , england how drop the dead donkey did not make it into the top ten is beyond me .
i am surprised that no-one has picked up on the fact that only bbc comedies made it into the top ten .
hmmmm !
given a choice of one programme or another to watch , you all know you 'd pick a blackadder episode over an only fools every time chris comben , redhill , uk for sheer characterisation , topical plot and excellent humour , drop the dead donkey should have been there .
john harding , lancaster , england dibley , grave and good life should n't have been in the top 10 -lrb- dibley not in the top 20 -rrb- steptoe , red dwarf and father ted are so much better .
yes m / pm and blackadder are examples of brilliant writing , they transfer to radio just as well as tv and that 's the sign of superb writing .
rowan atkinson is one of the best comedic actors of all time , only he can make ' bob ' sound funny .
when it comes down to it , given a choice of one programme or another to watch , you all know you 'd pick a blackadder episode over an only fools every time .
chris comben , redhill , uk bring back the goodies ! !
elwood herring , birmingham , uk only fools and hoses should have won this by a mile , not by just 22 % of the vote .
it portrayed the aspirations of everyone .
it gave us sadness it gave us births , deaths and marriages but above all it gave us comedy by the bucket load .
a well deserved winner .
brian lee , bolton que ?
i do n't believe it .
do n't be stupid man .
o-o-o-o-only f-f-f-f-fools and horses at number one ?
ian butt , maldon , uk in my opinion , the women of britain have the title for best british sitcom .
absolutely fabulous is the winner hands down in my book !
sarah , kc , usa i agree with the first two choices , though my own personal favourite sitcom is father ted , and i was disappointed that it just missed out on the top ten .
however , i think its humour is lost on the majority of the population , whereas fools & horses has a more universal appeal .
james judge , altrincham , england .
que ?
i do n't believe it .
do n't be stupid man .
o-o-o-o-only f-f-f-f-fools and horses at number one ?
nah , sorry .
yes minister and yes prime minister should have won it by a mile .
but credit to all of them .
great british comedy at its best .
ian butt , maldon , essex , uk how dibley can come above yes , minister or porridge is utterly beyond me .
i love fools and horses , but it can not compete with the emotional integrity and brilliance of blackadder .
and on a lighter note , what about non-bbc sitcoms i.e. rising damp and father ted ?
grace , barcelona , spain although my favourite sitcom is blackadder , i voted for only fools as i think it is a better example of how a sitcom should be , i.e appealing to the widest possible audience , although i agree the specials set in other countries were poor .
out of the top 10 i agreed with all of them apart from the vicar of dibley , which was only commissioned -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- because dawn french is in it .
in my opinion the jokes are bad , with the only saving grace being roger lloyd pack reprising his role as trigger , but as a farmer rather than a road sweeper .
john , chesterfield , uk this poll is a sad reflection of the effect of dumbing down micky , saltburn , uk i 'm shocked vicar of dibley got as far as it did .
top three should have included fawlty towers , simply because everyone can see where basil is coming from , but can also see how rude he is , plus as was said , no catchphrases -lrb- except ' basil ! ' or ' i am from barcelona ' -rrb- .
and blackadder .. surely only fools and horses went on for too long and lost some of what made it funny ?
stuart gardner , uk i think everyone is basing that " only fools " is " best " purely on the never ending xmas specials that are thrown at us when there is no viewing competition and a guaranteed bored audience .
i get really annoyed with all the harking back to how good the old days were , " they do n't make shows like that anymore " .
we have now got reality tv and endless shows telling us how ill and at risk we all are .
i would rather be down the pub to be honest , making the most of my last pleasures these shows tell me i will soon lose .
william , france this poll is a sad reflection of the effect of dumbing down .
that a show as mindless and banal as only fools and horses can be considered better than fawlty towers is beyond belief .
' lite ' entertainment indeed .
micky , saltburn an impossible task !
richard avery , seville , spain what an impossible task !
every one of the top ten -lrb- with the exception of vicar of dibley -rrb- is a gem in its own right .
characters with personality , depth and predictable interaction with the other characters mark the apex of british television comedy .
as sir winston said ; " we shall never see their like again " .
of course dell and ' dave ' will win .
richard avery , seville , spain anything that has n't been repeated constantly on bbc america .
dad 's army and open all hours .
kat , uk / us only fools and horses is quality comedy , which is timeless , highly entertaining and has memorable characters that have stood the test of time .
you 're guaranteed to laugh every time you watch an episode .
it appeals to all and is without a doubt britain 's best sitcom !
jassi , birmingham , uk david jason is a national treasure dorothy williams , montreal canada open all hours with the great comedic talents of ronnie barker and david jason combining to give us such a wonderful show .
only fools and horses will win though because it appeals to all people - young and old , rich and poor .
david jason is a national treasure .
dorothy williams , montreal canada i think that only fools and horses will win , but my favourite has to be dad 's army ; it is timeless , clean humour .
i only regret that so many of the cast did not live to see how popular it would become !
michael buchanan , bolton , uk the characters , script , timing , every detail of fawlty towers have stood the test of time , a recommendation in itself .
yes , we know each and every episode off by heart , but believe it or not , that just seems to make it funnier .
vanessa macdonald , valletta , malta how i miss seeing hyacinth bucket and her slob of a brother-in-law , onslow .
keeping up appearances gets my vote linda carthew , gravenhurst ont , canada everyone knows it 's blackadder ben woodhouse , norwich , uk this effort to find the best british sitcom is a waste of time .
everyone knows it 's blackadder , and if they do n't , well they 're just wrong .
ben woodhouse , norwich , uk my fave is dad 's army , but i fear the awful only fools . will win .
i think dibley was good but not top ten material !
su , britain am i the only one who thinks that only fools and horses should have been retired after a couple of series ?
it is dated and tired , the ' specials ' never worked when they changed locations and it became popular for being popular .
my vote goes to the vicar of dibley which never ceases to make me laugh and at the same time does not insult my intelligence .
phil , devon , uk although i saw fawlty towers about 20 years ago , i did not really appreciate the comedy sitcom , until i watched the two series again recently at home on dvd .
i believe that this is best british sitcom i have ever watched , and in my opinion should be voted the best .
a close second would be dad 's army .
john weightman , london i reckon that faulty towers will win , but my vote personally goes to blackadder .
unlike a number of sitcoms , this one got better and better as more of them got made .
a true classic !
nathan james , liverpool my favourite is fawlty towers for its sheer enthusiasm barry p , havant , england whichever entry wins it is noticeable that the finalists are from that dreaded group of ' family shows ' .
apart from parts of blackadder 2 the humour is based on intelligence rather than crudity , perhaps aspiring writers for the future will note this .
my favourite is fawlty towers for its sheer enthusiasm and some of the funniest action .
unlike most other shows ft does not work in audio only , it has to be seen as well as heard .
barry p , havant , england i 'd find it hard to choose one in particular .
my personal favourites are yes minister , open all hours and dad 's army .
that said , it will also be difficult to describe the winner as britain 's favourite sitcom , as all the entrants are bbc programmes !
why is father ted not included ?
peter larrad , oldham , england every single one on this list is a comic gem and a testament to our unique and powerful sense of humour .
the winner hands down for me is only fools and horses .
never has a programme been able to keep coming back with the same characters and still make us smile ed , london uk i will be astonished if only fools and horses does n't win .
it 's not my favourite , but it seems the only sitcom whose appeal transcends all barriers of fashion , age , class and political leanings .
that said , my vote goes for blackadder , and i still lament the fact that the vicar of dibley made the top ten when the young ones and father ted did n't , and citizen smith did n't even make the shortlist !
ben , liverpool i find it difficult to choose the comedy which met its remit with most success - there have been many that provided me with near endless laughs .
timeless shows like porridge and blackadder can be just as fresh today as they were when first broadcast .
red dwarf can make me laugh , even though i 'm sure i know the scripts off by heart .
only fools does n't seem to hold up over time - perhaps because they dragged it on too long .
fawlty towers is a classic farce but is a farce really intelligent enough ?

viewers have voted only fools and horses as britain 's favourite sitcom .
the winner was announced in a live final on bbc two , with blackadder in second place and the vicar of dibley a surprise third .
votes have been taken since january , when the bbc asked the public to nominate their favourite from a list of 10 including dad 's army , fawlty towers , open all hours , the good life and porridge .
was only fools and horses right to win ?
what is your favourite sitcom ?
what is the funniest sitcom moment ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments it beggars belief that the vicar of dibley made the top 100 , let alone came 3rd paul , cardiff although black adder will always be my favourite , everyone knew ' .. fools and horses ' would win .
despite the fact that some of the recent christmas specials have been poor , there are so many classic moments from it , that it could never have been beaten .
and whilst fawlty towers and blackadder are fantastic , they seem removed and surreal , whilst del and rodders could be people from up the road .
so many of the top ten though , display the wonder and originality of british comedy , that it beggars belief that the vicar of dibley made the top 100 , let alone came 3rd .
paul , cardiff i totally agree with michael samuel of wolverhampton .
blackadder is by far the funniest sitcom .
only fools & horses is a classic , but really a classic soap / comedy .
people love the trotters , but just because they are popular it does not mean that they are the funniest .
anyone who is intelligent enough to understand sarcasm & appreciate truly great comedy will agree that blackadder is the true winner , with fawlty towers a close second !
as for the vicar of dibley , i would rather eat one of baldrick 's toe-nails than watch it - it simply is not funny .
shaun , stanwick , northants , england i wonder how many of you moaning about the result actually bothered to register your own vote ?
i do n't like only fools and horses myself , but the bbc would n't show endless repeats and del boy specials if nobody was watching them -lrb- or would they ? -rrb- .
i 'm amazed fawlty towers did n't fare better , and i 'd watch repeats of red dwarf , blackadder and drop the dead donkey any day , but these appeal to a more limited audience than the likes of only fools and vicar of dibley .
kat , derby what a stupid question !
how can you possibly choose one ?
there 's so many truly excellent ones : only fools and horses , dad 's army , steptoe and son , ' til death us do part , rise and fall of rp , rising damp , the good life , men behaving badly , etc .
sadly open all hours ruins itself by legalising making fun of people who stammer .
it is not funny in any way to stammer .
dave deacon , england dad 's army can not be beaten for the sheer genius of the script writing coupled with the brilliant cast .
every episode is a gem .
it still appeals to young and old alike and is the best sitcom ever produced .
david griffiths , bexhill , east sussex my top 5:1 .
fawlty towers 2 .
only fools and horses 3 .
porridge 4 .
blackadder 5 .
open all hours tim nicholson , herne bay i can accept only fools and horses coming first it 's a great comedy regardless of the more recent episodes although i think blackadder really should have won .
but i 'm still really blown away at vicar of dibley coming third , how did it beat classics like dad 's army and fawlty towers ?
it 's unbelievable that such an unfunny , crime against comedy got into the top ten let alone the third best british comedy of all time .
michael samuel , wolverhampton , england was dreading that only fools would win ... it passed its sell by date about six specials and three seasons ago mike toone , derby , uk i must be the only person in the country to find ' ofah ' boring then .
the jokes can be seen a mile off , and really are n't very funny at all .
it 's nice to see blackadder coming so high , its truly intelligent writing , and brilliant comic performances deserve to be number one .
and surely it 's time for a repeat of yes minister ?
with the current political landscape , we need some good satire .
emma , london i was dreading that only fools would win , not that i do n't like it , but it passed its sell by date about six specials and three seasons ago .
consistence-wise it should have been either blackadder ; porridge ; open all hours or dad 's army .
i 'm still bemused how the vicar of dibley made it to number 3 - divine intervention i think .
miketoone , derby , uk i was honestly surprised when fawlty towers and yes , minister went out of the running quite so early on .
i was still optimistic that my favourite - the hilarious , witty and comical blackadder , stood a chance of winning .
alas , it was not to be !
on a positive note , the night showed what a wonderfully varied repertoire of situation comedy we have the joy to watch in great britain !
kirsty-jacqueline lingard , edinburgh all i can say is where was steptoe and son ?
andrew burns , st marys , usa blackadder not winning was as poor a choice as bad as butch oscar wilde , father of 20 children and author of the pamphlet ' why i like to do it with girls ' being sent down for being a whoopsie ed , london , uk what about the thin blue line ? - excellent comedy .
of the 10 , i would have voted for blackadder .
thomas wirshup , portland oregon usa all i can say is where was steptoe and son ?
andrew burns , st marys , georgia , usa i believe fawlty towers is consistently the best british sitcom .
ofah is brilliant but ft filmed 12 nuggets of gold while latterly ofah has been hit and miss .
paul reid , hamilton , scotland the early years were great , but spare us another christmas special !
it should have been off to the glue factory years ago .
the beeb are the only fools flogging us dead horses .
dave .
chris giles , reading , england how drop the dead donkey did not make it into the top ten is beyond me .
i am surprised that no-one has picked up on the fact that only bbc comedies made it into the top ten .
hmmmm !
given a choice of one programme or another to watch , you all know you 'd pick a blackadder episode over an only fools every time chris comben , redhill , uk for sheer characterisation , topical plot and excellent humour , drop the dead donkey should have been there .
john harding , lancaster , england dibley , grave and good life should n't have been in the top 10 -lrb- dibley not in the top 20 -rrb- steptoe , red dwarf and father ted are so much better .
yes m / pm and blackadder are examples of brilliant writing , they transfer to radio just as well as tv and that 's the sign of superb writing .
rowan atkinson is one of the best comedic actors of all time , only he can make ' bob ' sound funny .
when it comes down to it , given a choice of one programme or another to watch , you all know you 'd pick a blackadder episode over an only fools every time .
chris comben , redhill , uk bring back the goodies ! !
elwood herring , birmingham , uk only fools and hoses should have won this by a mile , not by just 22 % of the vote .
it portrayed the aspirations of everyone .
it gave us sadness it gave us births , deaths and marriages but above all it gave us comedy by the bucket load .
a well deserved winner .
brian lee , bolton que ?
i do n't believe it .
do n't be stupid man .
o-o-o-o-only f-f-f-f-fools and horses at number one ?
ian butt , maldon , uk in my opinion , the women of britain have the title for best british sitcom .
absolutely fabulous is the winner hands down in my book !
sarah , kc , usa i agree with the first two choices , though my own personal favourite sitcom is father ted , and i was disappointed that it just missed out on the top ten .
however , i think its humour is lost on the majority of the population , whereas fools & horses has a more universal appeal .

rowan atkinson is one of the best comedic actors of all time , only he can make ' bob ' sound funny .
when it comes down to it , given a choice of one programme or another to watch , you all know you 'd pick a blackadder episode over an only fools every time .
chris comben , redhill , uk bring back the goodies ! !
elwood herring , birmingham , uk only fools and hoses should have won this by a mile , not by just 22 % of the vote .
it portrayed the aspirations of everyone .
it gave us sadness it gave us births , deaths and marriages but above all it gave us comedy by the bucket load .
a well deserved winner .
brian lee , bolton que ?
i do n't believe it .
do n't be stupid man .
o-o-o-o-only f-f-f-f-fools and horses at number one ?
ian butt , maldon , uk in my opinion , the women of britain have the title for best british sitcom .
absolutely fabulous is the winner hands down in my book !
sarah , kc , usa i agree with the first two choices , though my own personal favourite sitcom is father ted , and i was disappointed that it just missed out on the top ten .
however , i think its humour is lost on the majority of the population , whereas fools & horses has a more universal appeal .
james judge , altrincham , england .
que ?
i do n't believe it .
do n't be stupid man .
o-o-o-o-only f-f-f-f-fools and horses at number one ?
nah , sorry .
yes minister and yes prime minister should have won it by a mile .
but credit to all of them .
great british comedy at its best .
ian butt , maldon , essex , uk how dibley can come above yes , minister or porridge is utterly beyond me .
i love fools and horses , but it can not compete with the emotional integrity and brilliance of blackadder .
and on a lighter note , what about non-bbc sitcoms i.e. rising damp and father ted ?
grace , barcelona , spain although my favourite sitcom is blackadder , i voted for only fools as i think it is a better example of how a sitcom should be , i.e appealing to the widest possible audience , although i agree the specials set in other countries were poor .
out of the top 10 i agreed with all of them apart from the vicar of dibley , which was only commissioned -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- because dawn french is in it .
in my opinion the jokes are bad , with the only saving grace being roger lloyd pack reprising his role as trigger , but as a farmer rather than a road sweeper .
john , chesterfield , uk this poll is a sad reflection of the effect of dumbing down micky , saltburn , uk i 'm shocked vicar of dibley got as far as it did .
top three should have included fawlty towers , simply because everyone can see where basil is coming from , but can also see how rude he is , plus as was said , no catchphrases -lrb- except ' basil ! ' or ' i am from barcelona ' -rrb- .
and blackadder .. surely only fools and horses went on for too long and lost some of what made it funny ?
stuart gardner , uk i think everyone is basing that " only fools " is " best " purely on the never ending xmas specials that are thrown at us when there is no viewing competition and a guaranteed bored audience .
i get really annoyed with all the harking back to how good the old days were , " they do n't make shows like that anymore " .
we have now got reality tv and endless shows telling us how ill and at risk we all are .
i would rather be down the pub to be honest , making the most of my last pleasures these shows tell me i will soon lose .
william , france this poll is a sad reflection of the effect of dumbing down .
that a show as mindless and banal as only fools and horses can be considered better than fawlty towers is beyond belief .
' lite ' entertainment indeed .
micky , saltburn an impossible task !
richard avery , seville , spain what an impossible task !
every one of the top ten -lrb- with the exception of vicar of dibley -rrb- is a gem in its own right .
characters with personality , depth and predictable interaction with the other characters mark the apex of british television comedy .
as sir winston said ; " we shall never see their like again " .
of course dell and ' dave ' will win .
richard avery , seville , spain anything that has n't been repeated constantly on bbc america .
dad 's army and open all hours .
kat , uk / us only fools and horses is quality comedy , which is timeless , highly entertaining and has memorable characters that have stood the test of time .
you 're guaranteed to laugh every time you watch an episode .
it appeals to all and is without a doubt britain 's best sitcom !
jassi , birmingham , uk david jason is a national treasure dorothy williams , montreal canada open all hours with the great comedic talents of ronnie barker and david jason combining to give us such a wonderful show .
only fools and horses will win though because it appeals to all people - young and old , rich and poor .
david jason is a national treasure .
dorothy williams , montreal canada i think that only fools and horses will win , but my favourite has to be dad 's army ; it is timeless , clean humour .
i only regret that so many of the cast did not live to see how popular it would become !
michael buchanan , bolton , uk the characters , script , timing , every detail of fawlty towers have stood the test of time , a recommendation in itself .
yes , we know each and every episode off by heart , but believe it or not , that just seems to make it funnier .
vanessa macdonald , valletta , malta how i miss seeing hyacinth bucket and her slob of a brother-in-law , onslow .
keeping up appearances gets my vote linda carthew , gravenhurst ont , canada everyone knows it 's blackadder ben woodhouse , norwich , uk this effort to find the best british sitcom is a waste of time .
everyone knows it 's blackadder , and if they do n't , well they 're just wrong .
ben woodhouse , norwich , uk my fave is dad 's army , but i fear the awful only fools . will win .
i think dibley was good but not top ten material !
su , britain am i the only one who thinks that only fools and horses should have been retired after a couple of series ?
it is dated and tired , the ' specials ' never worked when they changed locations and it became popular for being popular .
my vote goes to the vicar of dibley which never ceases to make me laugh and at the same time does not insult my intelligence .
phil , devon , uk although i saw fawlty towers about 20 years ago , i did not really appreciate the comedy sitcom , until i watched the two series again recently at home on dvd .
i believe that this is best british sitcom i have ever watched , and in my opinion should be voted the best .
a close second would be dad 's army .
john weightman , london i reckon that faulty towers will win , but my vote personally goes to blackadder .
unlike a number of sitcoms , this one got better and better as more of them got made .
a true classic !
nathan james , liverpool my favourite is fawlty towers for its sheer enthusiasm barry p , havant , england whichever entry wins it is noticeable that the finalists are from that dreaded group of ' family shows ' .
apart from parts of blackadder 2 the humour is based on intelligence rather than crudity , perhaps aspiring writers for the future will note this .
my favourite is fawlty towers for its sheer enthusiasm and some of the funniest action .
unlike most other shows ft does not work in audio only , it has to be seen as well as heard .
barry p , havant , england i 'd find it hard to choose one in particular .
my personal favourites are yes minister , open all hours and dad 's army .
that said , it will also be difficult to describe the winner as britain 's favourite sitcom , as all the entrants are bbc programmes !
why is father ted not included ?
peter larrad , oldham , england every single one on this list is a comic gem and a testament to our unique and powerful sense of humour .
the winner hands down for me is only fools and horses .
never has a programme been able to keep coming back with the same characters and still make us smile ed , london uk i will be astonished if only fools and horses does n't win .
it 's not my favourite , but it seems the only sitcom whose appeal transcends all barriers of fashion , age , class and political leanings .
that said , my vote goes for blackadder , and i still lament the fact that the vicar of dibley made the top ten when the young ones and father ted did n't , and citizen smith did n't even make the shortlist !
ben , liverpool i find it difficult to choose the comedy which met its remit with most success - there have been many that provided me with near endless laughs .
timeless shows like porridge and blackadder can be just as fresh today as they were when first broadcast .
red dwarf can make me laugh , even though i 'm sure i know the scripts off by heart .
only fools does n't seem to hold up over time - perhaps because they dragged it on too long .
fawlty towers is a classic farce but is a farce really intelligent enough ?

the researchers have estimated that fewer than 5,000 of the endangered great apes remain in their habitat .
that represents an astonishing drop of 12,000 gorillas since 1994 , says the group conservation international .
war , over-hunting , mining and the spread of humans into the apes ' former habitat have placed the species under serious threat it is claimed . "
if community-based conservation projects get in and have the support of the government then 10-15 years down the line populations will become stable again " dr patrick mehlman " this decline is massive .
but these are also extraordinary circumstances .
this is an area that was ravaged by war , " juan carlos bonilla , senior director for central africa at conservation international , told bbc news online .
" there 's room for concern and for cautious optimism .
there 's been an extraordinary response .
never has so much interest centred on this area for conservation , " he added .
' massive decline ' but if the gorilla 's decline continues at the present pace , conservationists agree that it might not be long before it is driven to extinction .
" gorillas are slow reproducers .
this has to be a long-term focus , " dr patrick mehlman , director of africa programmes for dian fossey gorilla fund international , told bbc news online .
the eastern lowland gorilla is found almost exclusively in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
civil war and mining of the mineral coltan , which is used to make pinhead capacitors in mobile phones and laptops , has brought an influx of people into areas where the apes live .
with this often comes a thriving bushmeat trade .
" there 's all sorts of things being done , but it 's logistically a very difficult place to work , " said david jay , project co-ordinator at the born free foundation .
" ideally , you would n't ban the coltan mining , because it 's a very poor area and you do n't want to deny people a livelihood .
but you want to make sure it 's being done in a sustainable way . "
a spokeswoman for the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- told bbc news online : " we and other organisations are working on the bushmeat issue to encourage those countries in which it is a problem to enforce their own laws on the killing and selling of great apes .
" but when the political situation is out of control it 's very hard to see how there 's going to be any priority put on those laws .
it 's looking very bleak at the moment . "
long haul maiko national park in drc , which is home to many lowland gorillas and has been a protected area since 1938 , has had little actual protection according to conservation international .
the organisation is making an estimated $ 3m -lrb- £ 1.6m -rrb- investment in the dian fossey gorilla fund international -lrb- dfgfi -rrb- to strengthen its programme in the region .
included within this investment is a plan to strengthen protection for the maiko national park .
" in eastern congo , at present , we do n't have these huge multinational logging companies building these roads that then become paths for the bushmeat out , " said dr mehlman .
he added that he wanted to establish projects to get existing communities in the drc involved with conservation of the gorillas .
" i 'm optimistic for the long haul .
if community-based conservation projects get in and have the support of the government then 10-15 years down the line populations will become stable again . "
dr mehlman said he also wanted to develop industries in the area not based on timber .
these include banana growing and tourism .
ebola is another contributing factor to the gorilla 's demise .
when the gorilla is pushed into ever smaller areas , ebola and other diseases can spread like wildfire through its population .
a recent survey of mountain gorillas showed their numbers had risen 17 % since 1989 .

the researchers have estimated that fewer than 5,000 of the endangered great apes remain in their habitat .
that represents an astonishing drop of 12,000 gorillas since 1994 , says the group conservation international .
war , over-hunting , mining and the spread of humans into the apes ' former habitat have placed the species under serious threat it is claimed .
if community-based conservation projects get in and have the support of the government then 10-15 years down the line populations will become stable again dr patrick mehlman " this decline is massive .
but these are also extraordinary circumstances .
this is an area that was ravaged by war , " juan carlos bonilla , senior director for central africa at conservation international , told bbc news online .
see where eastern lowland gorillas live " there 's room for concern and for cautious optimism .
there 's been an extraordinary response .
never has so much interest centred on this area for conservation , " he added .
' massive decline ' but if the gorilla 's decline continues at the present pace , conservationists agree that it might not be long before it is driven to extinction .
" gorillas are slow reproducers .
this has to be a long-term focus , " dr patrick mehlman , director of africa programmes for dian fossey gorilla fund international , told bbc news online .
the eastern lowland gorilla is found almost exclusively in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
gorillas are just another victim of the country 's civil war civil war and mining of the mineral coltan , which is used to make pinhead capacitors in mobile phones and laptops , has brought an influx of people into areas where the apes live .
with this often comes a thriving bushmeat trade .
" there 's all sorts of things being done , but it 's logistically a very difficult place to work , " said david jay , project co-ordinator at the born free foundation .
" ideally , you would n't ban the coltan mining , because it 's a very poor area and you do n't want to deny people a livelihood .
but you want to make sure it 's being done in a sustainable way . "
a spokeswoman for the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- told bbc news online : " we and other organisations are working on the bushmeat issue to encourage those countries in which it is a problem to enforce their own laws on the killing and selling of great apes .
" but when the political situation is out of control it 's very hard to see how there 's going to be any priority put on those laws .
it 's looking very bleak at the moment . "
long haul maiko national park in drc , which is home to many lowland gorillas and has been a protected area since 1938 , has had little actual protection according to conservation international .
the organisation is making an estimated $ 3m -lrb- £ 1.6m -rrb- investment in the dian fossey gorilla fund international -lrb- dfgfi -rrb- to strengthen its programme in the region .
included within this investment is a plan to strengthen protection for the maiko national park .
" in eastern congo , at present , we do n't have these huge multinational logging companies building these roads that then become paths for the bushmeat out , " said dr mehlman .
he added that he wanted to establish projects to get existing communities in the drc involved with conservation of the gorillas .
" i 'm optimistic for the long haul .
if community-based conservation projects get in and have the support of the government then 10-15 years down the line populations will become stable again . "
dr mehlman said he also wanted to develop industries in the area not based on timber .
these include banana growing and tourism .
ebola is another contributing factor to the gorilla 's demise .
when the gorilla is pushed into ever smaller areas , ebola and other diseases can spread like wildfire through its population .
a recent survey of mountain gorillas showed their numbers had risen 17 % since 1989 .
it suggested conservation efforts to protect the species from poachers in their remote habitat were paying off .
eastern lowland gorillas are concentrated in the maiko national park in eastern dr congo .

bbc news online looks back at his long and respected career .
for more than half a century , alistair cooke 's weekly broadcasts of letter from america for bbc radio monitored the pulse of life in the united states and relayed its strengths and weaknesses to 50 countries .
his retirement from the show earlier this month after 58 years , due to ill health , brought a flood of tributes for his huge contributing to broadcasting .
born in salford , near manchester , northern england , alistair cooke was the son of a methodist minister .
alistair cooke : consummate broadcaster winning a scholarship to jesus college , cambridge he read english , edited the undergraduate magazine , granta , and founded the cambridge university mummers .
alistair cooke made his first visit to the united states in 1932 , on a commonwealth fund fellowship which took him to both yale and harvard universities .
following his return to britain , he became the bbc 's film critic and , in 1935 , london correspondent for america 's national broadcasting corporation .
he returned to the united states in 1937 to work as a commentator on american affairs for the bbc .
he made his home there and , in 1941 , became an american citizen .
a passion for jazz march 1946 saw the first edition of american letter , which became letter from america in 1949 .
the series was the longest-running series in history to be presented by a single person .
alistair cooke never decided what he was going to talk about until he wrote the script , made no notes during the preceding week and preferred to rely on his memory .
in an interview given at the time of the 3,000th edition of letter from america , he found much to criticise about the united states .
" in america , " he said , " the race is on between its decadence and its vitality , and it has lots of both . "
he addressed congress in 1973 cooke led his listeners through the american vicissitudes of korea , kennedy , vietnam , watergate , nixon 's resignation and clinton 's scandals .
in all of this , cooke pulled no punches .
the lyricism of his broadcasting and the urbanity of his voice did not disguise his fears for america which he saw becoming a more violent society .
a liberal by nature , he reserved particular dislike for what he saw as the shallow flag-waving of the reagan presidency .
alongside working for the bbc and the guardian , for which he wrote from 1945 to 1972 , he developed a passion for jazz and golf and , as a film critic , he mixed with hollywood stars .
as a commentator on history , cooke was sometimes an eyewitness too .
he was just yards away from senator bobby kennedy when the latter was assassinated in 1968 .
he was never as comfortable on television as radio but , by the 1970s , his hugely successful television series america recounted his personal history of his adopted homeland and won international acclaim , two emmy awards and spawned a million-selling book .
british or american ?
the queen awarded him an honorary knighthood in 1973 and the following year , for a journalist , he received the ultimate recognition - he was asked to address the united states congress on its 200th anniversary .
he told his audience he felt as if he was in a dream , standing naked before them and there was only one thing he could find to say .
teasing , he exclaimed to the assembled legislators , " i gratefully accept your nomination for president of the united states ! "
naturally , he brought the house down .
many britons thought he was american , but to the americans he was the quintessential brit , the man who brought them the best of british television as presenter of masterpiece theatre .
for his part , he explained , " i feel totally at home in both countries . "
he impressed both audiences with his high quality work .
with his unquenchable curiosity , alistair cooke remained for decades the consummate broadcaster , an elegant writer and a man of enormous wit and charm who made sense of the american century .
a special one hour tribute , remembering alistair cooke will be broadcast on bbc radio four at 2100 bst on tuesday 30 march , 2004 and at 2000 bst on saturday 3rd april , 2004 .
a world service tribute is being broadcast at 1030 gmt , 1430gmt -lrb- not europe -rrb- and 2130 gmt -lrb- europe -rrb- on tuesday 30 march , 2004 .

a liberal by nature , he reserved particular dislike for what he saw as the shallow flag-waving of the reagan presidency .
alongside working for the bbc and the guardian , for which he wrote from 1945 to 1972 , he developed a passion for jazz and golf and , as a film critic , he mixed with hollywood stars .
as a commentator on history , cooke was sometimes an eyewitness too .
he was just yards away from senator bobby kennedy when the latter was assassinated in 1968 .
he was never as comfortable on television as radio but , by the 1970s , his hugely successful television series america recounted his personal history of his adopted homeland and won international acclaim , two emmy awards and spawned a million-selling book .
british or american ?
the queen awarded him an honorary knighthood in 1973 and the following year , for a journalist , he received the ultimate recognition - he was asked to address the united states congress on its 200th anniversary .
he told his audience he felt as if he was in a dream , standing naked before them and there was only one thing he could find to say .
teasing , he exclaimed to the assembled legislators , " i gratefully accept your nomination for president of the united states ! "
naturally , he brought the house down .
many britons thought he was american , but to the americans he was the quintessential brit , the man who brought them the best of british television as presenter of masterpiece theatre .
for his part , he explained , " i feel totally at home in both countries . "
he impressed both audiences with his high quality work .
with his unquenchable curiosity , alistair cooke remained for decades the consummate broadcaster , an elegant writer and a man of enormous wit and charm who made sense of the american century .
a special one hour tribute , remembering alistair cooke will be broadcast on bbc radio four at 2100 bst on tuesday 30 march , 2004 and at 2000 bst on saturday 3rd april , 2004 .
