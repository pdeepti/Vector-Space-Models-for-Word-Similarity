brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .
" if virulence goes up , it would trigger larger outbreaks and more poultry deaths ... and this increases the chance of human to human transmission , " virologist keo poon from the university of hong kong told reuters news agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands answers in german bse scare hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .

the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .
in the last year , blair has had to endure a series of sharp blows to his position .
the latest was on tuesday when the government just barely won a house of commons vote 316 to 311 on increasing university tuition fees . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair survives to fight another day british prime minister tony blair claimed a narrow victory on tuesday evening as the conservative opposition and rebels in his own party were defeated on the student fees vote .

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .
" if virulence goes up , it would trigger larger outbreaks and more poultry deaths ... and this increases the chance of human to human transmission , " virologist keo poon from the university of hong kong told reuters news agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands answers in german bse scare hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .

overall , according to le monde , 270 people are mentioned on the list from 40 countries , 17 of which are in europe .
the information was confirmed by abdel saheb salmane qotob , an official from the iraqi oil ministry , who also said that the matter would be pursued in court to recuperate the money for the iraqi people .
pasqua is alleged to have received 12 million barrels of oil , which , at current prices of 35 dollars a barrel , would net the former french minister about 420 million dollars or over half a billion euro .
also on this list are other prominent french figures , including at least two prime ministers and two foreign ministers .
pasqua , who sits on the influential budget commission in the parliament , has furiously denied the claims .
" i have never received anything from saddam hussein , neither money , nor oil " , he told le monde .
" i am not and have never been a friend of his . "
pasqua protests that he was not one of those who visited iraq regularly , saying , " there are a certain number of countries that i do not know .
iraq is one of them .
syria is another . "
furthermore , he suspects dirty tricks from the " american services . "
he told le figaro , " if they are quoting my name and they know it is not true , this might be to discredit the list ... because perhaps on the list there are the names of people which would be better not getting out .
i am just trying to understand , i have no information , i am speculating . "
before entering the european parliament , pasqua was french interior minister for two spells from 1986-1991 and then again from 1993-1995 .
his group in the european parliament has 23 seats , making it the sixth largest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu set to renew zimbabwe sanctions eu foreign ministers , due to meet in brussels on feb .
23 will approve the renewal of the targeted sanctions on leaders of zimbabwe 's ruling zanu-pf party , diplomats have confirmed .
the measures , which were put in place in 2002 , restrict the travel of 72 government officials and people close to them , in retaliation for human rights abuses in the country .

his words followed a generally upbeat meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday when several member states stressed the importance of striking a deal as soon as possible .
member states are aware that if the talks - which collapsed at a summit last - slide into late 2004 , or 2005 , the problems are only likely to be greater .
at this time , a new european commission will be finding its feet , while talks on future funding of the eu - always a bitter subject - will have taken off .
the current eu presidency , ireland , will present a progress report on the constitution to eu leaders at a summit in march and from there will be decided whether to pursue a deal in earnest .

schily insisted that the planned repatriation would go off smoothly considering that millions of afghan refugees from other countries were already back in afghanistan .
following a talk with his afghan counterpart , ali ahmad dschalali , schily stressed that the german government accepted civil war refugees only for a limited time , but not on a permanent basis .
the interior minister also urged afghanistan to do more in its fight against the drug trade , but admitted that thriving drug markets in germany and elsewhere in europe were compounding the problem . schily also announced on wednesday that germany would in future cooperate closely with turkey in battling organized crime because turkey is a key transit hub for drugs via the balkans to europe . more briefs 27.01.2004 -pipe- former professor accused of nazi-era “ mercy killings ” 27.01.2004 -pipe- germany and canada sign women ’ s soccer deal 27.01.2004 -pipe- bayern 's deisler leaves nerve clinic 27.01.2004 -pipe- german to be extradited from kazakhstan 27.01.2004 -pipe- schröder 's party fined for illegal donation 26.01.2004 -pipe- germany to compensate victims of nazi medical experiments 26.01.2004 -pipe- germany leads opposition to eu pay rise 26.01.2004 -pipe- gunman kills two in german mosque radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2004 a dating service that breaks taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans wants to bring love among the mentally disabled out of the shadows .
a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

following a talk with his afghan counterpart , ali ahmad dschalali , schily stressed that the german government accepted civil war refugees only for a limited time , but not on a permanent basis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2004 a dating service that breaks taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans wants to bring love among the mentally disabled out of the shadows .
a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2004 a dating service that breaks taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans wants to bring love among the mentally disabled out of the shadows .
a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2004 a dating service that breaks taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans wants to bring love among the mentally disabled out of the shadows .
a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .

in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .

but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2004 a dating service that breaks taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans wants to bring love among the mentally disabled out of the shadows .
a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

at the same time wolfgang clement said he is not hoping for a " white knight " to save aventis from rival sanofi-synthelabo sa .
berlin fears that the 9,000 germans employed by aventis would be laid off if the takeover goes through .
clement said he had raised the issue with france , but he played down berlin ’ s involvement in the affair .
" we have no possibility other than to make the problems clear , publicly and privately , " the minister told reporters .
clement denied an earlier report that germany was helping to find a " white knight " for the french-based company .
" if shareholders decide on a takeover , then i hope that the german site and its interests will be taken into account , " he said .

a chocolate bar , for example was 7.2 percent more expensive last year than in the previous year .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .
" if virulence goes up , it would trigger larger outbreaks and more poultry deaths ... and this increases the chance of human to human transmission , " virologist keo poon from the university of hong kong told reuters news agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands answers in german bse scare hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .

originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .

overall , according to le monde , 270 people are mentioned on the list from 40 countries , 17 of which are in europe .
the information was confirmed by abdel saheb salmane qotob , an official from the iraqi oil ministry , who also said that the matter would be pursued in court to recuperate the money for the iraqi people .
pasqua is alleged to have received 12 million barrels of oil , which , at current prices of 35 dollars a barrel , would net the former french minister about 420 million dollars or over half a billion euro .
also on this list are other prominent french figures , including at least two prime ministers and two foreign ministers .
pasqua , who sits on the influential budget commission in the parliament , has furiously denied the claims .
" i have never received anything from saddam hussein , neither money , nor oil " , he told le monde .
" i am not and have never been a friend of his . "
pasqua protests that he was not one of those who visited iraq regularly , saying , " there are a certain number of countries that i do not know .
iraq is one of them .
syria is another . "
furthermore , he suspects dirty tricks from the " american services . "
he told le figaro , " if they are quoting my name and they know it is not true , this might be to discredit the list ... because perhaps on the list there are the names of people which would be better not getting out .
i am just trying to understand , i have no information , i am speculating . "
before entering the european parliament , pasqua was french interior minister for two spells from 1986-1991 and then again from 1993-1995 .
his group in the european parliament has 23 seats , making it the sixth largest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc eu parliamentarian denies receiving saddam ’ s millions pasqua 's name features on a list published by al-mada -lrb- the horizon -rrb- , an iraqi newspaper , which details those who received gifts from the former iraqi dictator .
overall , according to le monde , 270 people are mentioned on the list from 40 countries , 17 of which are in europe .
the information was confirmed by abdel saheb salmane qotob , an official from the iraqi oil ministry , who also said that the matter would be pursued in court to recuperate the money for the iraqi people .
pasqua is alleged to have received 12 million barrels of oil , which , at current prices of 35 dollars a barrel , would net the former french minister about 420 million dollars or over half a billion euro .
also on this list are other prominent french figures , including at least two prime ministers and two foreign ministers .
pasqua , who sits on the influential budget commission in the parliament , has furiously denied the claims .
" i have never received anything from saddam hussein , neither money , nor oil " , he told le monde .
" i am not and have never been a friend of his . "
pasqua protests that he was not one of those who visited iraq regularly , saying , " there are a certain number of countries that i do not know .
iraq is one of them .
syria is another . "
furthermore , he suspects dirty tricks from the " american services . "
he told le figaro , " if they are quoting my name and they know it is not true , this might be to discredit the list ... because perhaps on the list there are the names of people which would be better not getting out .
i am just trying to understand , i have no information , i am speculating . "
before entering the european parliament , pasqua was french interior minister for two spells from 1986-1991 and then again from 1993-1995 .
his group in the european parliament has 23 seats , making it the sixth largest .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .
" if virulence goes up , it would trigger larger outbreaks and more poultry deaths ... and this increases the chance of human to human transmission , " virologist keo poon from the university of hong kong told reuters news agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands answers in german bse scare hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .

franz osten became just what he set out looking for in 1920s india - the exotic .
he also turned into one of the founding fathers of india 's film industry . indian film buff himansu rai had a singular vision when he made his way to germany in 1924 .
he wanted to use european expertise to turn around the indian film business , and he planned to do so by making movies about the world 's religions . european-educated rai decided to start with christianity . inspired by the traditional passion plays , he headed to bavaria 's oberammergau , where the life and sufferings of jesus christ has been reenacted every decade since the 17th century .
once there he found willing collaborators in the ostermayr brothers , heads of emelka film company studios .
but by that time rai had scrapped his original idea of filming the passion of christ , and together with emelka he decided to start with the life of gautama buddha . the munich film studio was enticed by the promise of the exotic - in addition to rai 's assurance that he would cover production costs .

franz osten became just what he set out looking for in 1920s india - the exotic .
he also turned into one of the founding fathers of india 's film industry . indian film buff himansu rai had a singular vision when he made his way to germany in 1924 .
he wanted to use european expertise to turn around the indian film business , and he planned to do so by making movies about the world 's religions . european-educated rai decided to start with christianity . inspired by the traditional passion plays , he headed to bavaria 's oberammergau , where the life and sufferings of jesus christ has been reenacted every decade since the 17th century .
once there he found willing collaborators in the ostermayr brothers , heads of emelka film company studios .
but by that time rai had scrapped his original idea of filming the passion of christ , and together with emelka he decided to start with the life of gautama buddha . the munich film studio was enticed by the promise of the exotic - in addition to rai 's assurance that he would cover production costs .
director joe may 's successful movie " the indian tomb " had already proved in 1921 that german audiences were keen on films with foreign stories and locations .
the exotic was " in " in post-world war i germany . rai offered emelka the opportunity to make a film on location with real indians instead of the german actors made-up to look like indians .
the studio jumped at the chance and sent director franz osten , one of the three ostermayr brothers , to follow rai back to his homeland . 30 dazzling elephants osten , his german camera crew and 30 elephants laden with gold and jewels worth 450,000 gold marks -lrb- around $ 100,000 today -rrb- belonging to the cooperative maharajah of the city of jaipur , spent five months filming on some of india 's most impressive sites .
with the help of baton-wielding policemen , the thousands of extras were kept on the set and calm presided , despite the sweltering heat of the rajasthan sun in northwestern india . for osten , rai and emelka , at least , the efforst paid off .
" the light of asia , " starring himansu rai as guatama buddha , was a hit in germany , the first in a series of films that osten and rai made together .
rai 's wife , devika rani , the most sought after indian actress in the 1930s , also acted in osten 's films . bombay talkies rai and rani established their own film production company , " bombay talkies , " in 1934 , and enlisted osten 's talents .
german cameramen and technicians came from europe to train indian colleagues .
bombay talkies became one of the most influential studios in indian film history . osten , considered a second-rate filmmaker in germany , made 16 movies for bombay talkies within four years .
he and rai peppered the films with social criticism , striking out at corruption , the caste system and forced marriage . in 1939 , in the midst of filming , osten was arrested by the british colonial rulers and deported .
the 64-year-old returned to munich and never made another film .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

franz osten became just what he set out looking for in 1920s india - the exotic .
he also turned into one of the founding fathers of india 's film industry . indian film buff himansu rai had a singular vision when he made his way to germany in 1924 .
he wanted to use european expertise to turn around the indian film business , and he planned to do so by making movies about the world 's religions . european-educated rai decided to start with christianity . inspired by the traditional passion plays , he headed to bavaria 's oberammergau , where the life and sufferings of jesus christ has been reenacted every decade since the 17th century .
once there he found willing collaborators in the ostermayr brothers , heads of emelka film company studios .
but by that time rai had scrapped his original idea of filming the passion of christ , and together with emelka he decided to start with the life of gautama buddha . the munich film studio was enticed by the promise of the exotic - in addition to rai 's assurance that he would cover production costs .
director joe may 's successful movie " the indian tomb " had already proved in 1921 that german audiences were keen on films with foreign stories and locations .
the exotic was " in " in post-world war i germany . rai offered emelka the opportunity to make a film on location with real indians instead of the german actors made-up to look like indians .

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .
in the last year , blair has had to endure a series of sharp blows to his position .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .

lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .

who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .
in the last year , blair has had to endure a series of sharp blows to his position .

franz osten became just what he set out looking for in 1920s india - the exotic .
he also turned into one of the founding fathers of india 's film industry . indian film buff himansu rai had a singular vision when he made his way to germany in 1924 .
he wanted to use european expertise to turn around the indian film business , and he planned to do so by making movies about the world 's religions . european-educated rai decided to start with christianity . inspired by the traditional passion plays , he headed to bavaria 's oberammergau , where the life and sufferings of jesus christ has been reenacted every decade since the 17th century .
once there he found willing collaborators in the ostermayr brothers , heads of emelka film company studios .
but by that time rai had scrapped his original idea of filming the passion of christ , and together with emelka he decided to start with the life of gautama buddha . the munich film studio was enticed by the promise of the exotic - in addition to rai 's assurance that he would cover production costs .
director joe may 's successful movie " the indian tomb " had already proved in 1921 that german audiences were keen on films with foreign stories and locations .
the exotic was " in " in post-world war i germany . rai offered emelka the opportunity to make a film on location with real indians instead of the german actors made-up to look like indians .

with the help of baton-wielding policemen , the thousands of extras were kept on the set and calm presided , despite the sweltering heat of the rajasthan sun in northwestern india . for osten , rai and emelka , at least , the efforst paid off .
" the light of asia , " starring himansu rai as guatama buddha , was a hit in germany , the first in a series of films that osten and rai made together .

bombay talkies became one of the most influential studios in indian film history . osten , considered a second-rate filmmaker in germany , made 16 movies for bombay talkies within four years .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .
in the last year , blair has had to endure a series of sharp blows to his position .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

franz osten became just what he set out looking for in 1920s india - the exotic .
he also turned into one of the founding fathers of india 's film industry . indian film buff himansu rai had a singular vision when he made his way to germany in 1924 .
he wanted to use european expertise to turn around the indian film business , and he planned to do so by making movies about the world 's religions . european-educated rai decided to start with christianity . inspired by the traditional passion plays , he headed to bavaria 's oberammergau , where the life and sufferings of jesus christ has been reenacted every decade since the 17th century .
once there he found willing collaborators in the ostermayr brothers , heads of emelka film company studios .
but by that time rai had scrapped his original idea of filming the passion of christ , and together with emelka he decided to start with the life of gautama buddha . the munich film studio was enticed by the promise of the exotic - in addition to rai 's assurance that he would cover production costs .
director joe may 's successful movie " the indian tomb " had already proved in 1921 that german audiences were keen on films with foreign stories and locations .
the exotic was " in " in post-world war i germany . rai offered emelka the opportunity to make a film on location with real indians instead of the german actors made-up to look like indians .
the studio jumped at the chance and sent director franz osten , one of the three ostermayr brothers , to follow rai back to his homeland . 30 dazzling elephants osten , his german camera crew and 30 elephants laden with gold and jewels worth 450,000 gold marks -lrb- around $ 100,000 today -rrb- belonging to the cooperative maharajah of the city of jaipur , spent five months filming on some of india 's most impressive sites .
with the help of baton-wielding policemen , the thousands of extras were kept on the set and calm presided , despite the sweltering heat of the rajasthan sun in northwestern india . for osten , rai and emelka , at least , the efforst paid off .
" the light of asia , " starring himansu rai as guatama buddha , was a hit in germany , the first in a series of films that osten and rai made together .
rai 's wife , devika rani , the most sought after indian actress in the 1930s , also acted in osten 's films . bombay talkies rai and rani established their own film production company , " bombay talkies , " in 1934 , and enlisted osten 's talents .
german cameramen and technicians came from europe to train indian colleagues .
bombay talkies became one of the most influential studios in indian film history . osten , considered a second-rate filmmaker in germany , made 16 movies for bombay talkies within four years .
he and rai peppered the films with social criticism , striking out at corruption , the caste system and forced marriage . in 1939 , in the midst of filming , osten was arrested by the british colonial rulers and deported .
the 64-year-old returned to munich and never made another film .
in germany , his name is hardly known .
in india , however , he left his mark as one of the founders of bollywood . anne herrberg -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin goes bollywood clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .
" if virulence goes up , it would trigger larger outbreaks and more poultry deaths ... and this increases the chance of human to human transmission , " virologist keo poon from the university of hong kong told reuters news agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands answers in german bse scare hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .

the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .

" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .

franz osten became just what he set out looking for in 1920s india - the exotic .
he also turned into one of the founding fathers of india 's film industry . indian film buff himansu rai had a singular vision when he made his way to germany in 1924 .
he wanted to use european expertise to turn around the indian film business , and he planned to do so by making movies about the world 's religions . european-educated rai decided to start with christianity . inspired by the traditional passion plays , he headed to bavaria 's oberammergau , where the life and sufferings of jesus christ has been reenacted every decade since the 17th century .
once there he found willing collaborators in the ostermayr brothers , heads of emelka film company studios .
but by that time rai had scrapped his original idea of filming the passion of christ , and together with emelka he decided to start with the life of gautama buddha . the munich film studio was enticed by the promise of the exotic - in addition to rai 's assurance that he would cover production costs .
director joe may 's successful movie " the indian tomb " had already proved in 1921 that german audiences were keen on films with foreign stories and locations .
the exotic was " in " in post-world war i germany . rai offered emelka the opportunity to make a film on location with real indians instead of the german actors made-up to look like indians .
the studio jumped at the chance and sent director franz osten , one of the three ostermayr brothers , to follow rai back to his homeland . 30 dazzling elephants osten , his german camera crew and 30 elephants laden with gold and jewels worth 450,000 gold marks -lrb- around $ 100,000 today -rrb- belonging to the cooperative maharajah of the city of jaipur , spent five months filming on some of india 's most impressive sites .
with the help of baton-wielding policemen , the thousands of extras were kept on the set and calm presided , despite the sweltering heat of the rajasthan sun in northwestern india . for osten , rai and emelka , at least , the efforst paid off .
" the light of asia , " starring himansu rai as guatama buddha , was a hit in germany , the first in a series of films that osten and rai made together .
rai 's wife , devika rani , the most sought after indian actress in the 1930s , also acted in osten 's films . bombay talkies rai and rani established their own film production company , " bombay talkies , " in 1934 , and enlisted osten 's talents .
german cameramen and technicians came from europe to train indian colleagues .
bombay talkies became one of the most influential studios in indian film history . osten , considered a second-rate filmmaker in germany , made 16 movies for bombay talkies within four years .
he and rai peppered the films with social criticism , striking out at corruption , the caste system and forced marriage . in 1939 , in the midst of filming , osten was arrested by the british colonial rulers and deported .
the 64-year-old returned to munich and never made another film .
in germany , his name is hardly known .
in india , however , he left his mark as one of the founders of bollywood . anne herrberg -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin goes bollywood clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat .

the government of british prime minister tony blair was exonerated from any wrongdoing in the death of weapons expert david kelly on wednesday .
but the so-called hutton inquiry had plenty of harsh criticism for the bbc . in what will come as a welcome boost for the beleaguered blair , u.k. judge lord hutton said claims that the british government had doctored intelligence in a controversial dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction was “ unfounded ” and no one could be held responsible for kelly ’ s suicide . kelly , a weapons expert at the british ministry of defense , was found dead in july after being named as a source for a bbc report that alleged the government " sexed up " a dossier used to make the case for war against iraq . “ i am satisfied that kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist , ” lord hutton said on wednesday , adding there could be no way to foresee the public pressure put on the scientist would cause him to take his life . however , hutton said bbc reporter andrew gilligan was wrong to say that to beef up an otherwise lackluster dossier , the government had intentionally included a now questionable claim that iraqi weapons of mass destruction were deployable in 45 minutes . “ the reality was that the 45-minute claim was based on an intelligence report the secret intelligence service considered to be reliable , ” hutton said . bbc blasted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan from the bbc .
in his 328-page report , he also lambasted the bbc ’ s supervisory system as “ defective ” and said gilligan had unfairly attacked the government ’ s integrity without properly founding the charges . in response to hutton ’ s withering criticism , bbc board of governors chairman gavyn davies said late wednesday afternoon he would resign . addressing the house of commons on wednesday , blair welcomed the results of the inquiry .
in a strongly worded statement he said there should be now be no doubts about the actions of the government during the affair . “ the allegation that i or anyone else lied to this house or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- is itself the real lie , ” blair said . since kelly 's death , blair has been sharply criticized by the media and opposition conservatives for his alleged role in the affair .
members in his own party have also criticized him for not being forthright in the disclosure of the facts quoted in the weapons dossier .
in the last year , blair has had to endure a series of sharp blows to his position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2004 a dating service that breaks taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans wants to bring love among the mentally disabled out of the shadows .
a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .

brussels is confident its measures against spiraling bird flu in southeast asia are sufficient to keep the disease away from eu borders , even as fears rise that the deadly virus might jump the species barrier . after last week ’ s official discovery of the outbreak of bird flu in thailand , the spread of the disease has taken on staggering dimensions with the deadly virus now detected in china , laos , vietnam , japan , cambodia , indonesia , south korea , taiwan and pakistan .
the avian flu virus has killed at least eight people so far and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than sars that ravaged south east asia last year .
originally discovered in waterfowl and subsequently believed to be passed on to chickens , the avian flu strain first jumped from chicken to human in 1997 in hong kong , infecting 18 people and killing six of them .
the virus containing the deadly h5n1 strain causes flu-like symptoms in humans ranging from sudden high fever , head-and body ache , fatigue and cough .
patients can on to develop lung infections and need to be isolated immediately .
lee jong-wook , who heads the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- , spoke on wednesday of a " serious threat to global health " even as south east asia ’ s poultry industry took a severe battering following export bans by several nations .
brussels clamps import ban on thai chicken the european union , the second largest buyer of thai chicken , was quick to impose a ban on chicken meat exports from thailand last week after bangkok confirmed the avian flu outbreak .
however the eu ’ s health and consumer protection commissioner , david byrne came under fire for inadvertently supporting false claims by the thai government that there was no avian flu in the country – four days before brussels imposed the ban on thai chicken exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vendor and live chicken at a malaysian market .
this week however , the 15-nation eu reinforced its hard line against thailand , saying poultry imports will be off supermarket shelves in the european union for at least five months .
" an independent verification of measures taken by thai authorities to eradicate the disease has to take place -lrb- before lifting the ban -rrb- , " the european commission ’ s health and consumer protection spokeswoman beate gminder told a news conference .
" reliance on thai assurances is not the best way forward . "
eu veterinary experts are to meet on feb .
2-3 to discuss the situation with thai authorities .
gminder added that the length of the ban should be seen in relation to the dutch case of bird flu last year .
the netherlands followed international rules for combating the virus and resumed chicken exports after five months .
on wednesday france announced it had asked the european commission to also ban the import of live birds from countries in asia affected by the outbreak of bird flu .
france ’ s agriculture , health and trade ministries said in a statement that the move would cover a ban on all live birds including pets arriving with passengers .
officials stressed that passengers travelling to affected countries in asia should avoid all contact with live chickens and poultry markets .
germany plays down consumer fears the german government also sought to reassure consumers on wednesday .
the german consumer protection ministry said in a statement that eu export bans on poultry products from asia were sufficient to ward off the virus from european borders and stressed that existing older imports of chicken from the affected regions didn ’ t pose a threat to german consumers because the virus was killed if the meat was cooked properly .
bernhard fleischer , the director of the hamburg tropical institute , said in a television interview on wednesday that the risk of a bird flu infection in germany was " absolutely minimal . "
fleischer also ruled out the avian flu virus being imported into germany through the luggage of tourists coming back to europe from the affected regions .
" the virus is not very stable and it would definitely be destroyed during a long haul , if it was there at all , " he said .
experts fear mutation of strain but despite the reassurances that the virus stands little chance of making it to europe , worries still persist that that the h5n1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it .
the who fears that a new influenza pandemic could begin if humans become infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time .
who officials believe that co-infection could breed an entirely new virus that could spread from person to person .
doctors believe that humans can so far only catch the disease through exposure to live chickens .
but medical circles are now alarmed about the prospect of a sudden mutation which produces a strain of h5n1 capable of transmission between humans .
there is already evidence that the h5n1 strain has become more virulent , judging by the unusually large number of ducks dying from bird flu in southern china .
" if virulence goes up , it would trigger larger outbreaks and more poultry deaths ... and this increases the chance of human to human transmission , " virologist keo poon from the university of hong kong told reuters news agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands answers in german bse scare hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .

a matchmaking service in germany has successfully brought together lonely hearts with mental disabilities .
long taboo in many places , bernd zemellas is teaching patients that love and relationships are human rights . the protestant foundation in alsterdorf near hamburg is the largest facility for the mentally disabled in northern germany , with more than 1,200 residents .
it 's also the workplace of psychologist bernd zemellas , who is famous for " the treasure chest , " a matchmaking service for people with mental disabilities .
since he started his unconventional dating service in 1998 , zemellas has attracted more than 300 clients .
zemella doesn ’ t see any difference between his and a " normal " dating service .
" the keyword ‘ normality ’ here is decisive , " he explains .
" fulfilling one ’ s desire for a partner is a human right in my opinion .
and helping people take a step in that direction is a major concern of mine . "
more than 300,000 people in germany are mentally disabled .
depending on the degree of their handicap , many are housed in assisted-living situations and eek out a living through social assistance and by doing odd jobs in workshops that employ people with disabilities .
others work and live entirely independently and only require ambulant help .
nonetheless , talk of relationships or sexuality between disabled people has remained a taboo subject .
all too often , society views mentally disabled people like children – naive and asexual .
zemella is working to change those stereotypes .
looking for a first love many of the people who come to zemella have never had a relationship .
for some , daily life is so hard to tackle that there is no leisure time remaining to hunt for a partner .
others must be taught that they have the right to sexuality and relationships .
normally , it ’ s the people caring for the mentally disabled who must first broach the subject , introducing their patients to the idea of the " right one , " or " treasure hunt " and lead them to their local matchmaker .
very few go to zemella on their own .
and those who do make it to zemella tend to play traditional roles when searching for a match .
women , he says , tend to wait to be " chosen , " whereas men tend to be more active when it comes to searching .
accordingly , the psychologist says he has three times as many men in his index cards than women .
the same selection criteria are applied as at any other matchmaking service – couples are brough together based on appearance , hobbies and other interests .
but the degree of handicap is also important .
" those who are less mentally disabled want to be with someone who they can do something with , " zemella explains .
bring people together the old way using a digital camera , zemella takes snapshots of his customers and places their data in his computer .
however , unlike many dating services , zemella doesn ’ t leave it up to the computer to make the match-ups .
" i still do everything by hand .
in principal i could let the computer do that , but i still have a relatively small number of customers .
i go to a lot of trouble .
i take at least one morning each week to go back and look and check to see things – was that right decision ? " he says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children hold hands whether or not a match has been successfully made is usually already determined on the first date .
some pairs are even hand-in-hand before they leave the psychologist ’ s office .
parents and caretakers often attend the first meeting between a potential couple and zemella .
of zemella ’ s several hundred erstwhile lonely hearts , 40 pairs have been successfully brought together and two couples have married .
others have moved in together , while some just see their " sweetheart " a few times each week because they reside in assisted living situations and are unable to get together more often .
overcoming preconceptions there can also be other challenges .
many couples face resistance from their families and friends , since loving relationships between the mentally disabled are still a foreign idea to many .
" i ’ ve already had the concrete experience that , after i took on a woman , i got a call a few days later , " zemella explains .
" it was from her father .
the parents said : ‘ this is not something our daughter should be doing .
please take her off your list .
i assume that in many cases , the parents are afraid that these relationship will increase the desire to perhaps have a child and start a family . "
parents often fear that the offspring of their mentally disabled son or daughter will also be born with a handicap , zemella said .
but today this legal gray zone has been eliminated .
minors can no longer be sterilized and fully grown women can only be given the operation if they voluntarily submit to it .
if they ’ re not capable of making a decisions for themselves , it must be made by their legal custodian .
many parents also worry that a child could overstrain a mentally disabled couple .
few embark on family path to date , the desire for children among mentally handicapped couples has been more the exception than the rule .
of all the couples zemella has brought together , he says only two are seriously considering embarking on the family path .
if they do , there are avenues of support available to them .
they can live in special facilities that provide care for both the persons with disabilities and their children .
but in the cases of the worst disabilities , sometimes the children would have to be places in a foster home .
that ’ s why zemella finds it important to provide guidance not only to the couples , but also to their parents .
" i don ’ t want to create any misconceptions , since the whole thing can be problematic , " says zemella .
" to that end i share the concerns of parents .
but people can and should speak openly about this rather than just categorically saying : ‘ no , that ’ s not something for you , and that ’ s why this ‘ relationship chapter ’ is nothing for you . ’ " daphne antachopolous -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compensation for being born ?

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- thai pm risks losing populist touch bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 28 january , 2004 , 05:01 gmt thai pm risks losing populist touch tim luard bbc news online one man who may come to rue asia 's outbreak of bird flu more than most is thaksin shinawatra , thailand 's high-profile , populist prime minister .
since coming to power in a landslide election victory three years ago , the charismatic , multimillionaire telecoms tycoon has become the most prominent leader in the region , widely admired by thais and other asians for his dynamic , hands-on style .
so for a man who prides himself on his public relations skills and problem-solving , his belated admission that his government kept quiet about avian flu to avoid causing panic has been extremely damaging .
analysts said it also highlighted a growing tendency for mr thaksin 's liking for secrecy and bluster to land him in hot water .
" the way he has tried to present the country as picture-perfect often leads to a cover-up of various problems and makes the government unable to react in a timely and efficient way , " said sunai phasuk , a human rights activist and adviser to the thai senate foreign relations committee .
mr thaksin has yet to recover from the political fallout over a series of attacks in the muslim-majority south earlier in january , according to dr sunai .
several soldiers and policemen died in a series of bomb incidents , arson attacks and a raid on an army base , which together presented a very different image to the one the government has carefully nurtured to help lure millions of tourists to thailand 's beaches .
first the prime minister upset the families of the dead soldiers by saying they " deserved to die " because of their negligence .
then he persistently blamed the attacks on " bandits " , refusing to admit that militant separatists might be involved , even after his security adviser said this was the case . "
he came in with a clear vision to bring the country forwards .
and whenever a problem arises , he 's there . "
ajva taulananda , chairman of the thai chamber of commerce .
mr thaksin 's subordinates are normally intimidated into letting him have his way , dr sunai said .
" he threatens government officials and they do n't dare report anything for fear of being reprimanded .
by the time the true story emerges , the problem is too big to solve " .
no confidence vote opposition parties are now angrily comparing mr thaksin 's attitude to the bird flu to the secrecy and obfuscation of chinese officials during the initial stages of last year 's sars epidemic .
they want a no-confidence vote in parliament - a move unlikely to succeed , given mr thaksin 's government majority of 220 .
after a brief flurry of outrage in the press -lrb- including an editorial in the nation saying " the thaksin government has been caught red-handed in lying to the people " -rrb- much of the media has succumbed to pressure to support the government 's actions to deal with bird flu , critics said .
" many papers exercise self-censorship to avoid confrontation with -lrb- mr -rrb- thaksin , " said one thai journalist , who preferred to remain anonymous .
" since coming to power ... he and his inner circle have been largely successful in taming the once vibrant and proud print journalists by using their enormous economic influence and by flagging up patriotism , " said the journalist , noting that almost all broadcast media are already owned and controlled either by the government or by the thaksin family business empire .
there is no doubt mr thaksin faces potentially the most serious challenge since he came to power .
the fact that the cover-up involved thailand 's huge chicken industry could undermine the prime minister 's popularity in his own rural heartland , says giles ungpakorn , a political analyst at chulalongkorn university .
" he failed to come clean from the beginning ... on a matter affecting the livelihoods of a lot of small farmers , " he said .
" this is a very serious issue " .
despite the criticisms , it is not clear how much of a setback the crisis will prove longer term , or if it will affect mr thaksin 's hopes of returning to power next year as head of a single-party government - the first in thailand 's history .
the prime minister has relied on his continuing popularity to overcome setbacks in the past .
the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs ordered by mr thaksin last year did not affect his public support , neither did an earlier finding by thailand 's corruption commission that he had failed to declare all of his wealth .
poorer voters like mr thaksin 's offers of cheap medical care and debt relief , his nationalist platform and his contempt for the " bangkok elite . "
big business like his ceo style of government and his " taksinomics " policies that have created a new boom in the country where the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s began .
and despite his present difficulties , he is still a hero to the thai people , according to ajva taulananda , chairman of the thai chamber of commerce .
" he came in with a clear vision to bring the country forwards .
and whenever a problem arises , he 's there .
he 's not hiding .
he comes out to lead the team , together with the private sector , " he said .
" we used to have a lot of red tape , but mr thaksin has re-engineered the government structure , " said mr ajva .
thailand 's economic growth has impressed its neighbours .
leaders in the philippines , singapore and malaysia have all voiced admiration for their thai counterpart , who has made little secret of his own ambition to succeed the likes of lee kuan yew and mahathir mohamad as the region 's foremost statesman .
but as mr thaksin faces questions from other asian leaders at wednesday 's emergency bird flu summit , he may find it hard to present his usual beaming image of the proud host who can do no wrong .

since coming to power in a landslide election victory three years ago , the charismatic , multimillionaire telecoms tycoon has become the most prominent leader in the region , widely admired by thais and other asians for his dynamic , hands-on style .
the media magnate turned pm is accused of covering up the truth so for a man who prides himself on his public relations skills and problem-solving , his belated admission that his government kept quiet about avian flu to avoid causing panic has been extremely damaging .
analysts said it also highlighted a growing tendency for mr thaksin 's liking for secrecy and bluster to land him in hot water .
" the way he has tried to present the country as picture-perfect often leads to a cover-up of various problems and makes the government unable to react in a timely and efficient way , " said sunai phasuk , a human rights activist and adviser to the thai senate foreign relations committee .
mr thaksin has yet to recover from the political fallout over a series of attacks in the muslim-majority south earlier in january , according to dr sunai .
several soldiers and policemen died in a series of bomb incidents , arson attacks and a raid on an army base , which together presented a very different image to the one the government has carefully nurtured to help lure millions of tourists to thailand 's beaches .
first the prime minister upset the families of the dead soldiers by saying they " deserved to die " because of their negligence .
then he persistently blamed the attacks on " bandits " , refusing to admit that militant separatists might be involved , even after his security adviser said this was the case .
he came in with a clear vision to bring the country forwards .
and whenever a problem arises , he 's there .
ajva taulananda , chairman of the thai chamber of commerce .
mr thaksin 's subordinates are normally intimidated into letting him have his way , dr sunai said .
" he threatens government officials and they do n't dare report anything for fear of being reprimanded .
by the time the true story emerges , the problem is too big to solve " .
no confidence vote opposition parties are now angrily comparing mr thaksin 's attitude to the bird flu to the secrecy and obfuscation of chinese officials during the initial stages of last year 's sars epidemic .
they want a no-confidence vote in parliament - a move unlikely to succeed , given mr thaksin 's government majority of 220 .
after a brief flurry of outrage in the press -lrb- including an editorial in the nation saying " the thaksin government has been caught red-handed in lying to the people " -rrb- much of the media has succumbed to pressure to support the government 's actions to deal with bird flu , critics said .
" many papers exercise self-censorship to avoid confrontation with -lrb- mr -rrb- thaksin , " said one thai journalist , who preferred to remain anonymous .
have mr thaksin 's chickens come home to roost ?
" since coming to power ... he and his inner circle have been largely successful in taming the once vibrant and proud print journalists by using their enormous economic influence and by flagging up patriotism , " said the journalist , noting that almost all broadcast media are already owned and controlled either by the government or by the thaksin family business empire .
there is no doubt mr thaksin faces potentially the most serious challenge since he came to power .
the fact that the cover-up involved thailand 's huge chicken industry could undermine the prime minister 's popularity in his own rural heartland , says giles ungpakorn , a political analyst at chulalongkorn university .
" he failed to come clean from the beginning ... on a matter affecting the livelihoods of a lot of small farmers , " he said .
" this is a very serious issue " .
despite the criticisms , it is not clear how much of a setback the crisis will prove longer term , or if it will affect mr thaksin 's hopes of returning to power next year as head of a single-party government - the first in thailand 's history .
the prime minister has relied on his continuing popularity to overcome setbacks in the past .
the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs ordered by mr thaksin last year did not affect his public support , neither did an earlier finding by thailand 's corruption commission that he had failed to declare all of his wealth .
poorer voters like mr thaksin 's offers of cheap medical care and debt relief , his nationalist platform and his contempt for the " bangkok elite . "
regional leaders have come to see mr thaksin as a model big business like his ceo style of government and his " taksinomics " policies that have created a new boom in the country where the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s began .
and despite his present difficulties , he is still a hero to the thai people , according to ajva taulananda , chairman of the thai chamber of commerce .
" he came in with a clear vision to bring the country forwards .
and whenever a problem arises , he 's there .
he 's not hiding .
he comes out to lead the team , together with the private sector , " he said .
" we used to have a lot of red tape , but mr thaksin has re-engineered the government structure , " said mr ajva .
thailand 's economic growth has impressed its neighbours .
leaders in the philippines , singapore and malaysia have all voiced admiration for their thai counterpart , who has made little secret of his own ambition to succeed the likes of lee kuan yew and mahathir mohamad as the region 's foremost statesman .
but as mr thaksin faces questions from other asian leaders at wednesday 's emergency bird flu summit , he may find it hard to present his usual beaming image of the proud host who can do no wrong .

" since coming to power ... he and his inner circle have been largely successful in taming the once vibrant and proud print journalists by using their enormous economic influence and by flagging up patriotism , " said the journalist , noting that almost all broadcast media are already owned and controlled either by the government or by the thaksin family business empire .
there is no doubt mr thaksin faces potentially the most serious challenge since he came to power .
the fact that the cover-up involved thailand 's huge chicken industry could undermine the prime minister 's popularity in his own rural heartland , says giles ungpakorn , a political analyst at chulalongkorn university .
" he failed to come clean from the beginning ... on a matter affecting the livelihoods of a lot of small farmers , " he said .
" this is a very serious issue " .
despite the criticisms , it is not clear how much of a setback the crisis will prove longer term , or if it will affect mr thaksin 's hopes of returning to power next year as head of a single-party government - the first in thailand 's history .
the prime minister has relied on his continuing popularity to overcome setbacks in the past .
the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs ordered by mr thaksin last year did not affect his public support , neither did an earlier finding by thailand 's corruption commission that he had failed to declare all of his wealth .
poorer voters like mr thaksin 's offers of cheap medical care and debt relief , his nationalist platform and his contempt for the " bangkok elite . "
regional leaders have come to see mr thaksin as a model big business like his ceo style of government and his " taksinomics " policies that have created a new boom in the country where the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s began .
and despite his present difficulties , he is still a hero to the thai people , according to ajva taulananda , chairman of the thai chamber of commerce .
" he came in with a clear vision to bring the country forwards .
and whenever a problem arises , he 's there .
he 's not hiding .
he comes out to lead the team , together with the private sector , " he said .
" we used to have a lot of red tape , but mr thaksin has re-engineered the government structure , " said mr ajva .
thailand 's economic growth has impressed its neighbours .
leaders in the philippines , singapore and malaysia have all voiced admiration for their thai counterpart , who has made little secret of his own ambition to succeed the likes of lee kuan yew and mahathir mohamad as the region 's foremost statesman .
but as mr thaksin faces questions from other asian leaders at wednesday 's emergency bird flu summit , he may find it hard to present his usual beaming image of the proud host who can do no wrong .

the ni chest , heart and stroke association has accused the government and food producers of failing to help the public to do anything about the problem .
wednesday is salt awareness day 2004 .
across the uk , about 34,000 people will die through high salt consumption , said the charity .
chief executive andrew dougal said producers had to cut unnecessary salt levels as a matter of urgency .
salt advice do not add salt at the table - use flavourings like herbs and spices if you have time , bake your own bread make your own stock instead of using stock cubes when buying tinned vegetables , go for brands with no added salt avoid crisps and salted peanuts go easy on bacon , sausages and takeaway foods check food labels - anything with less than 0.2 grams of sodium per hundred grams is fine food containing more than half a gram of sodium per hundred grams should be avoided " a bowl of cornflakes , for example , has the same salt concentration as seawater , " he said .
" the problem is that the average person has no way of telling , simply by looking at the food label .
" it may list sodium , but to find the true salt content , you need to multiply the sodium level by two and a half . "
salt raises blood pressure and increases the risk of heart attack or stroke .
it has also been linked to stomach cancer , osteoporosis and kidney problems .
however , the chest , heart and stroke association said most of the salt consumed is " hidden " in processed foods .
' tinned produce ' it said about 80 % of people surveyed carried out by cash -lrb- consensus action on salt and health -rrb- found current salt labelling incomprehensible .
" the best medical advice is for adults to eat no more than six grams of salt each day , and for children to eat only half of that , " said mr dougal .
" the biggest problem is that children tend to consume even more processed food than their parents , in the form of crisps , pre-prepared snacks , and tinned produce .
" even commercially produced bread , which is regarded as a healthy food , contains half the salt of seawater . "
cash and the ni chest , heart and stroke association said they wanted the government and food manufacturers to introduce much clearer and simpler labelling . "
the problem is that most people can not tell how much salt they are eating because it is added to their food without their consent , and the true salt content is disguised by confusing and misleading labelling " graham macgregor cash the charity said a third of people had raised blood pressure , a major cause of strokes and heart attacks and salt intake was an important contributory factor .
the government recommends salt consumption of no more than 6 grams per day -lrb- 3g or less for children -rrb- , but most adults consume around 12g .
cash chairman graham macgregor said : " food manufacturers must take responsibility for reducing intake .
" the problem is that most people can not tell how much salt they are eating because it is added to their food without their consent , and the true salt content is disguised by confusing and misleading labelling . "
among the events planned for wednesday is a meeting in the house of commons at which melanie johnson , the public health minister who has urged manufacturers to take action , is due to speak .

wales has one of the highest rates of borrowing in the uk and in caernarfon , north wales , advice workers are seeing an explosion of activity by so-called loan sharks .
as the bbc across the uk looks at spending and debt in a special hey big spender day , bbc news online looks at debt problems on one estate in the town .
on the maes barcer estate every other family owes money to a loan shark .
borrowers , often unemployed and on state benefits , seek them out when they can not get money elsewhere , but the penalty is that lenders often pay enormous rates of interest .
one company which operates on the estate and around wales - the provident - admits that for every £ 100 borrowed , there is an annual interest rate of 177 % .
but the firm says their rates are justified because they lend to people who have been refused credit elsewhere and because of the cost of collecting payments .
eiriona rees hughes managed to escape the grip of such a company after five years of trying .
' paying out ' mrs hughes borrowed from a lender after getting into debt after she married and said the costs " spiralled into a snowball " .
she added : " it was only about £ 400 but with interest rates it was a lot of paying out every week . "
mrs hughes , who works in a nursery school and helps out at a youth club , says she has now cleared her debts with the help of a credit union .
" if i wanted a loan for any reason i could -lrb- get one -rrb- because the interest rates are not so high , " she said .
" and they tell you if you can afford it or not .
" they do n't pressure you into taking things you ca n't afford . "
helen davies , who runs the maes barcer estate 's community centre , believes up to 60 % of people there borrow from door-step lenders at interest rates of up to 10 times the average bank loan .
" it 's a big problem for people in the area , " she said .
low take-up " but it 's the way people have learned to live round here . "
a new credit union , llechen , offering low interest rates , has been operating on the estate for 18 months .
so , far , take-up has been low , mainly because members have to save for eight weeks before they can borrow .
trustee manon davies is trying to get more people to turn away from the lending from loan sharks and join the credit union .
she says a £ 100 loan from the credit union would cost £ 3 interest over a 20-week period , whereas a loan from the provident firm would cost £ 47 in interest .
the credit union is also lobbying for extra funds to try to redeem existing high-interest loans and break the cycle of borrowing the debt redemption scheme , which operates in former coalfield areas , works by underwriting what would have been considered risky loans .
but the wales co-operative centre , which runs the debt redemption scheme in south wales , says it would have to link up with other organisations - including banks - to offer the scheme nationwide .

wales has one of the highest rates of borrowing in the uk and in caernarfon , north wales , advice workers are seeing an explosion of activity by so-called loan sharks .
as the bbc across the uk looks at spending and debt in a special hey big spender day , bbc news online looks at debt problems on one estate in the town .
on the maes barcer estate every other family owes money to a loan shark .
borrowers , often unemployed and on state benefits , seek them out when they can not get money elsewhere , but the penalty is that lenders often pay enormous rates of interest .
one company which operates on the estate and around wales - the provident - admits that for every £ 100 borrowed , there is an annual interest rate of 177 % .
but the firm says their rates are justified because they lend to people who have been refused credit elsewhere and because of the cost of collecting payments .
eiriona rees hughes managed to escape the grip of such a company after five years of trying .
' paying out ' mrs hughes borrowed from a lender after getting into debt after she married and said the costs " spiralled into a snowball " .
she added : " it was only about £ 400 but with interest rates it was a lot of paying out every week . "
mrs hughes , who works in a nursery school and helps out at a youth club , says she has now cleared her debts with the help of a credit union .
" if i wanted a loan for any reason i could -lrb- get one -rrb- because the interest rates are not so high , " she said .
" and they tell you if you can afford it or not .
" they do n't pressure you into taking things you ca n't afford . "
helen davies , who runs the maes barcer estate 's community centre , believes up to 60 % of people there borrow from door-step lenders at interest rates of up to 10 times the average bank loan .
" it 's a big problem for people in the area , " she said .
low take-up " but it 's the way people have learned to live round here . "
a new credit union , llechen , offering low interest rates , has been operating on the estate for 18 months .
so , far , take-up has been low , mainly because members have to save for eight weeks before they can borrow .
trustee manon davies is trying to get more people to turn away from the lending from loan sharks and join the credit union .
she says a £ 100 loan from the credit union would cost £ 3 interest over a 20-week period , whereas a loan from the provident firm would cost £ 47 in interest .
the credit union is also lobbying for extra funds to try to redeem existing high-interest loans and break the cycle of borrowing the debt redemption scheme , which operates in former coalfield areas , works by underwriting what would have been considered risky loans .
but the wales co-operative centre , which runs the debt redemption scheme in south wales , says it would have to link up with other organisations - including banks - to offer the scheme nationwide .

the ni chest , heart and stroke association has accused the government and food producers of failing to help the public to do anything about the problem .
wednesday is salt awareness day 2004 .
across the uk , about 34,000 people will die through high salt consumption , said the charity .
chief executive andrew dougal said producers had to cut unnecessary salt levels as a matter of urgency .
salt advice do not add salt at the table - use flavourings like herbs and spices if you have time , bake your own bread make your own stock instead of using stock cubes when buying tinned vegetables , go for brands with no added salt avoid crisps and salted peanuts go easy on bacon , sausages and takeaway foods check food labels - anything with less than 0.2 grams of sodium per hundred grams is fine food containing more than half a gram of sodium per hundred grams should be avoided " a bowl of cornflakes , for example , has the same salt concentration as seawater , " he said .
" the problem is that the average person has no way of telling , simply by looking at the food label .
" it may list sodium , but to find the true salt content , you need to multiply the sodium level by two and a half . "
salt raises blood pressure and increases the risk of heart attack or stroke .
it has also been linked to stomach cancer , osteoporosis and kidney problems .
however , the chest , heart and stroke association said most of the salt consumed is " hidden " in processed foods .
' tinned produce ' it said about 80 % of people surveyed carried out by cash -lrb- consensus action on salt and health -rrb- found current salt labelling incomprehensible .
" the best medical advice is for adults to eat no more than six grams of salt each day , and for children to eat only half of that , " said mr dougal .
" the biggest problem is that children tend to consume even more processed food than their parents , in the form of crisps , pre-prepared snacks , and tinned produce .
" even commercially produced bread , which is regarded as a healthy food , contains half the salt of seawater . "
cash and the ni chest , heart and stroke association said they wanted the government and food manufacturers to introduce much clearer and simpler labelling .
the problem is that most people can not tell how much salt they are eating because it is added to their food without their consent , and the true salt content is disguised by confusing and misleading labelling graham macgregor cash the charity said a third of people had raised blood pressure , a major cause of strokes and heart attacks and salt intake was an important contributory factor .
the government recommends salt consumption of no more than 6 grams per day -lrb- 3g or less for children -rrb- , but most adults consume around 12g .
cash chairman graham macgregor said : " food manufacturers must take responsibility for reducing intake .
" the problem is that most people can not tell how much salt they are eating because it is added to their food without their consent , and the true salt content is disguised by confusing and misleading labelling . "

the electronics and entertainment group has unveiled a 20 % fall in operating profit , to 159bn yen -lrb- £ 824m ; $ 1.5bn -rrb- for the last quarter of 2003 .
although the firm boasted strong sales of dvd-related products , the gains were not enough to offset slumping shipments of playstation 2 consoles .
ps2 sales fell 15 % during the quarter , although full-year targets were hit .
losing track sony , long the most successful of japan 's electronics exporters , has fallen on hard times over the past year .
nobuyuki idei remains optimistic sales in its core consumer electronics division have been weak , at least in part because its products have been perceived as tired .
at the same time , it has invested heavily in entertainment and other non-core activities - money which some analysts say has been rashly spent .
sony 's movie division was its weakest performer during the fourth quarter : profits were down 82 % and sales dropped 29 % as the studio could not match last year 's hit releases such as " spiderman " and " men in black 2 " .
over the same period , more focused electronics rivals such as sharp and matsushita - the firm behind the panasonic brand - have performed strongly .
high hopes sony has , however , maintained a relatively optimistic forecast for this year as a whole .
even as sales stagnate , the company will be boosted by the strength of the euro against the yen .
and some analysts said the results were better than they had feared .
a year ago , the company stunned investors , and sparked a general plunge in japanese shares , after unveiling a surprise $ 1bn loss .
sony chief executive nobuyuki idei now says the firm 's revival is " progressing smoothly " , and insists that new ranges of flat-screen tvs , dvd recorders and digital cameras promise to liven up its sluggish consumer electronics division .

the decision was taken after the court heard new arguments seeking to prove that robert lara and roderick licayan were innocent .
the execution of the two men convicted of involvement in the kidnapping of a chinese businessman and his aide in 1998 was due to take place on friday .
the last execution in the philippines was carried out in 2000 .
god has answered our prayers roberto lara 's mother last month , president gloria arroyo lifted a four-year-old moratorium on the death penalty , opening the way for the executions to resume .
her decision , which comes ahead of presidential elections in 2004 , followed a series of kidnappings which particularly targeted the ethnic chinese community .
' miscarriage of justice ' the justices voted 7-6 to " temporarily suspend the execution of roderick licayan and roberto lara on 30 january 2004 , for a period of 30 calendar days , " the court 's clerk in the capital , manila , announced .
the justices said they needed more time to consider whether claims of new evidence would warrant a re-trial of the two convicted men - a key demand by public defenders .
on monday , chief public defender percida acosta said that a lower court that convicted the two men had failed to give them due process by not allowing witnesses ' testimony to corroborate defendants ' claims of innocence .
ms acosta warned of " a miscarriage of justice " if the executions - by lethal injection - were to go ahead .
outside a prison south of manila , mr lara 's mother , benilda , said she was " very happy " with the court 's decision .
" i did not sleep all night , " tearful mother said , as she hugged her son 's two young children .
" god has answered our prayers . "
divisive issue a presidential spokesman said ms arroyo had halted all preparations for the executions after the court ruling .
in the past , president arroyo has used her powers to grant clemency to those sentenced to death by the courts .
but last month she said she " shall no longer stand in the way of executions " .
experts say the debate whether to execute the two convicted men has divided many filipinos .
supporters of capital punishment argue that it deters would-be criminals .
opponents , including the influential roman catholic church , say the death penalty is inhumane and does not deter crimes .

" my husband repudiated me when i was three months pregnant , " she says .
under morocco 's old family code khadija 's husband and thousands of other moroccan men could verbally divorce their wives at any time , and their decision was legally binding .
khadija was thrown out of her family home .
living in a shanty town she supports her two children and an ageing father on what she can beg from passers by .
times are hard and khadija has had to put her son in an apprenticeship with a tailor .
he is just five years old .
change in a strict muslim society like morocco 's , there is great shame in being a spurned wife . "
i was nine and i did n't want to live with my husband so i ran away ... but my parents beat me and took me back " azziza there is yet more shame in begging on the streets .
but these women are the victims of a family code that gave men in morocco all of the rights in marriage , and none of the responsibilities .
now this is about to change .
under a new family code , or the mudawana as it is known , husbands will now have to go to court to make their repudiation binding and women will no longer be legally required to be " obedient " to their husbands .
layla rhiwi and her organisation spring of equality , gives legal advice to women on matrimonial law .
she believes the new mudawana will make a difference to the problem of abandoned women and children living on the streets .
" under the new family code , whoever keeps the children keeps the marital house .
so they will no longer be on the streets .
this is an important protection for women . "
walli azziza was a child herself when her parents married her to an old man she did not know .
" i was nine and i did n't want to live with my husband so i ran away from my husband 's house , but my parents beat me and took me back . "
azziza 's marriage was not legal , but what was legal in accordance with the koran , was that her father as a walli , or male guardian , should decide her fate for her .
under the new mudawana a woman from the age of 18 , may be her own walli .
this expert resolution solved the sticking point which could have stopped dead the whole project of changing the mudawana .
traditional followers of morocco 's national religion were afraid that the mudawana would be re-written forsaking islamic principles , such as that of the walli .
street protests in favour of modernising the law were followed by a much larger protest against .
but since coming to the throne in 1999 , king mohammed vi lent his full weight to the idea of a new mudawana .
the document , the work of a royal commission allows for practices enshrined in the koran , such as polygamy , but makes them much harder in practice .
minors nadia yassine , of the association of justice and spirituality is perhaps morocco 's best known muslim leader .
she participated in the street demonstrations against changes to the family code in 2000 because she says , the proposals at the time were un-islamic and the result of foreign influence .
now a backer of the king 's mudawana , perhaps surprisingly , nadia yassine says it does not go far enough because women remain minors under the penal code , which has not changed .
on paper at least , with the adoption of the new mudawana , morocco is set to become one of the most progressive countries in terms of women 's rights in the arab world .
next , says layla rhiwi of spring time of equality , the magistrates and judges must be retrained .
" they are old , they are sexist and they will not change over night , " she says .
however , she is hopeful .
khadija and azziza , scrabbling for small change in the medina are also hopeful : " i trust in allah , i trust in the king , that one day i will have enough to eat , " says azziza .
" freedom costs money , " says nadia yassine .
" you ca n't liberate women without giving them any means .
if a woman wants to get divorced and she is illiterate and unemployed , how she can exercise this freedom ? "

mr dean 's enthusiasm is not translating into electoral success " we really are going to win this nomination , are n't we ? " he said , adding : " we can change america and we will . "
the bbc 's rob watson in manchester , new hampshire says that second place will be enough to keep mr dean in the race , but it is clear the initial enthusiasm for his campaign , marked by opposition to the war in iraq , is not translating into electoral success .
the contest now moves up a gear when voters in seven states from arizona to south carolina get to have their say on 3 february .

what is a primary ?
state-level poll to nominate a party 's candidate in the general election held for presidential and congressional races in some states voters are restricted to choosing candidates from the party for which they have registered support 29 states permit " open primaries " in which a voter may back a candidate regardless of party affiliation .
primaries first emerged in early 20th century to weaken the influence of party bosses interrupted by chants of " bring it on " , senator kerry retorted : " i intend to " .
" i ask democrats everywhere to join us so we can defeat george w bush and the economy of privilege , and so that we can fulfil the ideal of opportunity not just for some but for all americans , " he said .
senator kerry took a swipe at what he called " influence peddlers , the polluters ... the big oil and the special interests " , repeating his warning to president bush from iowa : " we 're coming , you 're going , and do n't let the door hit you on the way out . "
our correspondent says there was a sense among kerry supporters that this was political history in the making .
sub-zero voting he says that , with two victories under his belt , john kerry has a momentum that will be hard to stop .
as results flowed in , contenders senator john edwards and retired general wesley clark vied for third place .

our correspondent says , as was the case in iowa , democrat voters seemed less concerned about the fine print of the candidates ' policies than their ability to beat mr bush in the november election .

kraft 's sales have been hit as shoppers increasingly sought more healthy alternatives to its salty snacks and processed dairy products .

but while the only winter gear most of us put in our cars at this time of year is anti-freeze , explorer david hempleman-adams ' boot contains everything he needs to fight off hypothermia and frostbite .
it is -2c outside , someway above the -90c the renowned arctic adventurer has faced , but he is taking no chances .
david hempleman-adams knows what cold feels like " people do n't realise that these temperatures will kill you .
" as soon as you hit sub-zero temperatures , if you are caught outside , especially if you are elderly , young , or very thin , then your body temperature can fall dangerously if you are not prepared . "
last year , several hundred motorists became trapped overnight on the m11 and other roads as an unexpected snow fall brought traffic to a stand-still .
many were stuck dressed only in the clothes they wore to the office , and several abandoned their cars to try to complete the journey on foot .
a big mistake , says mr hempleman-adams .
" the problem is that people come out of their centrally heated houses , into their heated garages , then into their nice warm cars .
" if they get caught out , they find themselves stuck wearing just a shirt and a pair of sandals . "
preparation is key the adventurer regularly carries a sleeping bag , a flask of hot , sweet tea and a spade in his car when winter conditions are forecast .
" i know that 99.9 % of the time i 'm not going to need them , but for that 0.1 % they are essential . "
for him , preparation is the key to keeping out of trouble .
the key is that you must never assume it will never happen to you david hempleman-adams " you never hear of anyone dying of hypothermia at the north pole , because they have gone there prepared .
" but every year people die here after getting caught outside . "
if you do find yourself stuck in your car , the best bet is to stay there , he says .
" even the british army training in norway hunker down when the temperature hits -20 , because of the risk of frostbite . "
your woolly christmas jumper is not the best thing to wear if you want to keep warm .
wind chill mr hempleman-adams recommends putting on several thin layers , together with a wind-proof jacket .
" there 's a thing called wind chill factor , which we are not very good with in the country .
" it might say minus 2 on the forecast , but the wind can make that feel like minus 15 . "
he also recommends wearing the minimum - perhaps one layer plus a wind jacket - if you find yourself having to dig yourself or your car out of a drift .
" the digging will keep you warm , but you do n't want to build up a sweat as this can cause your body temperature to drop .
" once you stop , you can put the other clothes back on . "
and he warns against running your engine to keep warm if you have n't first checked there is no snow blocking the exhaust and forcing deadly carbon monoxide back into the car .
the explorer admits the chances of getting caught out in the cold are slim .
but you do n't survive everest , both poles , and an open-basket balloon flight across the atlantic without a realistic understanding of risk .
" the key is that you must never assume it will never happen to you " .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- migraine ' may raise stroke risk ' home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : wednesday , 28 january , 2004 , 09:01 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version migraine ' may raise stroke risk ' migraines affect one in 10 people migraine headaches may cause progressive brain damage and increase the risk of stroke , research suggests .
scientists have found evidence people who suffer from migraine have damage in an area of the brain called the cerebellum .
and the more frequent the migraine attacks , the higher the risk of damage .
the research , by a team from leiden university in the netherlands , is published in the journal of the american medical association .
if this turns out to be true , the whole view of migraine will change .
dr andrew dowson the researchers say their findings seem to refute the commonly held perception that migraine is essentially a trivial problem with transient symptoms .
they hope their work may lead to better treatments , which may prevent cumulative damage to the brain .
lead researcher dr mark kruit told bbc news online : " migraine may be a more serious disorder , not just a headache . "
common problem it is estimated that 12 % of the population of western europe and the us suffer from migraine attacks each year .
the study focused on 435 people .
some were free of migraine , some suffered standard attacks and some had a form called migraine with aura .
the study showed that patients who experience migraine with aura were at much higher risk for tissue damage - known as infarcts - in the cerebellar region of the brain than were patients who experienced migraine without aura .
the risk of damage was more than seven times greater in patients with migraine than in those who were free from the headaches , and that risk increased as the number of attacks increased .
the highest risk was in those patients with migraine with aura who had an attack frequency of one attack or more per month .
women with migraine - but not men - also showed evidence of brain damage in the white matter of another area of the brain called the cerebrum .
writing in the journal , the researchers say : " these findings indicate that adult migraine patients may be at increased risk of clinical stroke , and that the real extent of brain injury in migraine patients from the general population may have been underestimated . "
they say further studies are needed to confirm the results , but it may be that migraine guidelines should emphasis the need for early prevention to decrease the risk of brain lesions .
caution urged dr andrew dowson , medical advisor to the migraine action association , told bbc news online that previous research had not shown evidence of tissue damage in the cerebellum at anything other than background levels in migraine patients .
he said : " we are surprised with the findings .
we also feel that we should not alarm the public until more is known .
" having said that if this turns out to be true , the whole view of migraine will change .
" it is currently a self-limiting , quality of life affecting disorder , with treatment directed at reducing disruption .
" but if these findings are true it becomes potentially a progressive disease with entirely different management targets . "
migraines are a complex group of symptoms characterised by unpredictable attacks of typically moderate to severe , usually one-sided , throbbing headaches .
they are aggravated by routine physical activity such as climbing stairs , last from four to 72 hours , and are accompanied by nausea , vomiting , and sensitivity to sound and light .
