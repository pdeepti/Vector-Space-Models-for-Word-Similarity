the commission is threatening to take the german government to court in a third case unless it changes a law on deposits charged on non-reusable containers of beverages such as heineken nv beer and nestle sa 's vittel mineral water . germany is being sued over objections that the deposit discriminates against imports , which are more likely to be shipped in non-refillable cans and plastic bottles . " in practice , it 's very difficult for consumers to take the empty packaging back to a shop and get their deposit back , " jonathan todd , a commission spokesman , told a brussels news conference recently .
" this has the effect of being an obstacle to trade in the internal market . " efforts being made to avoid court the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , voted last week to simplify legislation levying deposits on beverage containers , excluding packaging considered environmentally friendly and bringing in a flat-rate deposit . the bundesrat voted in favor of a motion put forward by the state of bavaria to levy the deposits on all containers except those for wine , liquor , alcohol and milk , while exempting packaging such as tubular polyethylene bags , cartons and stand-up pouches .
the plan is similar to existing government proposals to change a system that levies deposits at different rates only on specific types of drinks . the european commission is delaying action for three months because " they are seriously considering changing the system , " todd said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .

" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .

" " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .

in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .

this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .

around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .
" the most important thing is to transport the whole complexity and horror of the wall - including the system that was behind it . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .

“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .

" if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .
" he would work hard to prove to his colleagues in germany , france , and other eu countries , that their opinion matters .

what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .

helga was recorded as having died on july 16 , 1943 . weling said van den berg had written back to deen on some of the blank pages of the diary , concealed within a school notebook marked " physics " and apparently transferred the diary back and forth between the pair .
he kept the diary after deen was deported , and saved it along with a lock of his girlfriend 's hair . no facts but emotions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helga deen .
in the diary , deen recorded some of her day-to-day experiences for van den berg , but even more of her emotions , weling said .
" maybe this diary will be a disappointment to you because it does n't contain facts , " deen wrote to van den berg .
" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .
" we are homeless , countryless and we have to adjust ourselves to that way of life .
what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .
the diary has drawn comparisons with the most famous holocaust-era diary , the one written by anne frank , the daughter of a german-jewish family who hid in an amsterdam attic for 25 months .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .

despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .

" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .

" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .

parts of the diary will be on display for one day on october 30 in tilburg , and the archive is negotiating with museums to show it elsewhere . " -lrb- deen -rrb- kept the secret diary for her boyfriend in order to help him understand what she was experiencing , " said yvonne weling of the tilburg regional archive .
deen , her brother , father and mother were shipped off to a nazi concentration camp in sobibor , poland , that july .
all four later died at the camp .
helga was recorded as having died on july 16 , 1943 . weling said van den berg had written back to deen on some of the blank pages of the diary , concealed within a school notebook marked " physics " and apparently transferred the diary back and forth between the pair .
he kept the diary after deen was deported , and saved it along with a lock of his girlfriend 's hair . no facts but emotions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helga deen .

" maybe this diary will be a disappointment to you because it does n't contain facts , " deen wrote to van den berg .
" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .
" we are homeless , countryless and we have to adjust ourselves to that way of life .
what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .
the diary has drawn comparisons with the most famous holocaust-era diary , the one written by anne frank , the daughter of a german-jewish family who hid in an amsterdam attic for 25 months .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”

the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .
" neither the russians nor the americans actively support the eu three deal , " said one western diplomat about the g8 meeting . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday .

" the european commission has concluded its long-standing investigation into the transfer of public assets , in the early ' 90s , to seven german regional public banks by ordering germany to recover € 3 billion plus interest , " a statement said . " these decisions close a very long and painful dispute between private and public banks in germany , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said . he added that his ruling would create " a level playing field in the sector , which is in the interest of businesses operating in germany , of the consumers / taxpayers , and of the banks themselves as it removes the uncertainty which had been hanging upon them for too long .

the situation between the european union and germany over illegal aid is just the latest in a line of recent clashes between the bloc 's governing body and its biggest economy . the commission on wednesday also issued a two-month ultimatum to germany to improve competition in the country 's postal sector . the commission wants to force open germany 's postal system to more competition after the german government 's refusal to give competitors of deutsche post access to the so-called " post-preparation services market , " according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the commercial collection , sorting and franking of letters under 100 grams is currently exclusively guaranteed to deutsche post under postal laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe an overwhelming case for germany ?
foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .
" he would work hard to prove to his colleagues in germany , france , and other eu countries , that their opinion matters . " martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de my favorite candidate the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed .
-lrb- oct .
20 , 2004 -rrb- kerry 's iraq stance finds more takers in europe europe 's reaction to the first us presidential televised debate shows that democratic challenger john kerry may have won more admirers in europe with his vow to repair damaged transatlantic alliances over the iraq war .

the suggestion has already met with resistance . the independent expert commission said that qualified workers would be needed in sectors such as insurance and banking , the health industry , and engineering , adding that there was already a shortage of german workers with the necessary skills to fill jobs in those areas .
the head of the commission , conservative politician rita süssmuth , said germany needed to allow " limited and well-targeted immigration " to prevent " bottlenecks .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .

in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .

" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .
like then , history will show that the war in iraq was also beneficial , perle said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

the suggestion has already met with resistance . the independent expert commission said that qualified workers would be needed in sectors such as insurance and banking , the health industry , and engineering , adding that there was already a shortage of german workers with the necessary skills to fill jobs in those areas .
the head of the commission , conservative politician rita süssmuth , said germany needed to allow " limited and well-targeted immigration " to prevent " bottlenecks . " " it could make a significant impact on the economic success of the country , " süssmuth said . difficult to gain acceptance interior minister otto schily - who created the expert commission last year - received its report with noticeable reserve , saying he 'd give the recommendations " careful consideration . "
but he added that with 4.35 million unemployed people in germany , it would be difficult to gain backing for an influx of immigrants . the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz , has spoken out against an influx of skilled foreign labor . " the work that is available in germany must be done by germans and the non-germans already living here , " he said during a radio interview on wednesday .
" i 'm against opening the doors for immigration in our labor market .
this would lead to too much discontent in germany . " flaws in new law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission says skilled foreign workers are needed in several sectors of the economy .
the panel of experts ' recommendation to open the doors to 25,000 immigrants next year comes just over two months before germany 's new immigration law comes into effect . the law was agreed in june after years of bitter wrangling over how to strike the appropriate balance between security , humanitarian , and economic concerns .
in the end , the law allowed for a smaller inflow of immigrants than the government had originally planned . business leaders criticized the immigration compromise when it was passed , saying more free movement of labor and freedom to recruit skilled workers was needed for germany to remain competitive . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green card numbers below target germany 's much-touted green card program launched four years ago to meet the need for qualified it workers from abroad has been given to only 17,000 people .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .

" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council .

this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .
" neither the russians nor the americans actively support the eu three deal , " said one western diplomat about the g8 meeting . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 my favorite candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the winner is .
the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .

" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?

" the european commission has concluded its long-standing investigation into the transfer of public assets , in the early ' 90s , to seven german regional public banks by ordering germany to recover € 3 billion plus interest , " a statement said . " these decisions close a very long and painful dispute between private and public banks in germany , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said . he added that his ruling would create " a level playing field in the sector , which is in the interest of businesses operating in germany , of the consumers / taxpayers , and of the banks themselves as it removes the uncertainty which had been hanging upon them for too long . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro symbol in front of the european central bank in frankfurt under legislation introduced at the start of the 1990s , german banks were required to build up substantial capital to maintain new minimum levels of solvency . westlb and six other public banks were given the money by their regional governments , which partly or fully own the banks , through transfers of public housing and other assets . that prompted a complaint to brussels from the association of german private banks , which also had to increase their solvency ratios without being able to draw on public funds . westlb , germany 's biggest public bank , was ordered by the commission to repay € 979 million plus interest . the other six banks targeted by the investigation , with their repayment amounts , are the landesbank berlin -lrb- € 810 million plus interest -rrb- , norddeutsche landesbank -lrb- € 472 million plus interest -rrb- , landesbank schleswig-holstein -lrb- € 432 million plus interest -rrb- , bayerische landesbank -lrb- € 260 million plus interest -rrb- , hamburgische landesbank -lrb- € 90 million plus interest -rrb- and landesbank hessen-thüringen -lrb- € 6 million plus interest -rrb- . deutsche post monopoly fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post : a monopoly ?
the situation between the european union and germany over illegal aid is just the latest in a line of recent clashes between the bloc 's governing body and its biggest economy . the commission on wednesday also issued a two-month ultimatum to germany to improve competition in the country 's postal sector . the commission wants to force open germany 's postal system to more competition after the german government 's refusal to give competitors of deutsche post access to the so-called " post-preparation services market , " according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the commercial collection , sorting and franking of letters under 100 grams is currently exclusively guaranteed to deutsche post under postal laws .
the newspaper said the commission 's move threatens to dismantle the german postal monopoly before its planned end in 2007/08 . deposit plan also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations of discrimination against imports may land germany in court .
the eu and germany are also at loggerheads over its beleaguered can and bottle deposit law .
the commission is threatening to take the german government to court in a third case unless it changes a law on deposits charged on non-reusable containers of beverages such as heineken nv beer and nestle sa 's vittel mineral water . germany is being sued over objections that the deposit discriminates against imports , which are more likely to be shipped in non-refillable cans and plastic bottles . " in practice , it 's very difficult for consumers to take the empty packaging back to a shop and get their deposit back , " jonathan todd , a commission spokesman , told a brussels news conference recently .
" this has the effect of being an obstacle to trade in the internal market . " efforts being made to avoid court the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , voted last week to simplify legislation levying deposits on beverage containers , excluding packaging considered environmentally friendly and bringing in a flat-rate deposit . the bundesrat voted in favor of a motion put forward by the state of bavaria to levy the deposits on all containers except those for wine , liquor , alcohol and milk , while exempting packaging such as tubular polyethylene bags , cartons and stand-up pouches .
the plan is similar to existing government proposals to change a system that levies deposits at different rates only on specific types of drinks . the european commission is delaying action for three months because " they are seriously considering changing the system , " todd said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .

parts of the diary will be on display for one day on october 30 in tilburg , and the archive is negotiating with museums to show it elsewhere . " -lrb- deen -rrb- kept the secret diary for her boyfriend in order to help him understand what she was experiencing , " said yvonne weling of the tilburg regional archive .
deen , her brother , father and mother were shipped off to a nazi concentration camp in sobibor , poland , that july .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .
" neither the russians nor the americans actively support the eu three deal , " said one western diplomat about the g8 meeting . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday .

" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .

" the european commission has concluded its long-standing investigation into the transfer of public assets , in the early ' 90s , to seven german regional public banks by ordering germany to recover € 3 billion plus interest , " a statement said . " these decisions close a very long and painful dispute between private and public banks in germany , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said . he added that his ruling would create " a level playing field in the sector , which is in the interest of businesses operating in germany , of the consumers / taxpayers , and of the banks themselves as it removes the uncertainty which had been hanging upon them for too long . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro symbol in front of the european central bank in frankfurt under legislation introduced at the start of the 1990s , german banks were required to build up substantial capital to maintain new minimum levels of solvency . westlb and six other public banks were given the money by their regional governments , which partly or fully own the banks , through transfers of public housing and other assets . that prompted a complaint to brussels from the association of german private banks , which also had to increase their solvency ratios without being able to draw on public funds . westlb , germany 's biggest public bank , was ordered by the commission to repay € 979 million plus interest . the other six banks targeted by the investigation , with their repayment amounts , are the landesbank berlin -lrb- € 810 million plus interest -rrb- , norddeutsche landesbank -lrb- € 472 million plus interest -rrb- , landesbank schleswig-holstein -lrb- € 432 million plus interest -rrb- , bayerische landesbank -lrb- € 260 million plus interest -rrb- , hamburgische landesbank -lrb- € 90 million plus interest -rrb- and landesbank hessen-thüringen -lrb- € 6 million plus interest -rrb- . deutsche post monopoly fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post : a monopoly ?
the situation between the european union and germany over illegal aid is just the latest in a line of recent clashes between the bloc 's governing body and its biggest economy . the commission on wednesday also issued a two-month ultimatum to germany to improve competition in the country 's postal sector . the commission wants to force open germany 's postal system to more competition after the german government 's refusal to give competitors of deutsche post access to the so-called " post-preparation services market , " according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the commercial collection , sorting and franking of letters under 100 grams is currently exclusively guaranteed to deutsche post under postal laws .

the eu and germany are also at loggerheads over its beleaguered can and bottle deposit law .
the commission is threatening to take the german government to court in a third case unless it changes a law on deposits charged on non-reusable containers of beverages such as heineken nv beer and nestle sa 's vittel mineral water . germany is being sued over objections that the deposit discriminates against imports , which are more likely to be shipped in non-refillable cans and plastic bottles . " in practice , it 's very difficult for consumers to take the empty packaging back to a shop and get their deposit back , " jonathan todd , a commission spokesman , told a brussels news conference recently .
" this has the effect of being an obstacle to trade in the internal market . " efforts being made to avoid court the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , voted last week to simplify legislation levying deposits on beverage containers , excluding packaging considered environmentally friendly and bringing in a flat-rate deposit . the bundesrat voted in favor of a motion put forward by the state of bavaria to levy the deposits on all containers except those for wine , liquor , alcohol and milk , while exempting packaging such as tubular polyethylene bags , cartons and stand-up pouches .
the plan is similar to existing government proposals to change a system that levies deposits at different rates only on specific types of drinks . the european commission is delaying action for three months because " they are seriously considering changing the system , " todd said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

the suggestion has already met with resistance . the independent expert commission said that qualified workers would be needed in sectors such as insurance and banking , the health industry , and engineering , adding that there was already a shortage of german workers with the necessary skills to fill jobs in those areas .
the head of the commission , conservative politician rita süssmuth , said germany needed to allow " limited and well-targeted immigration " to prevent " bottlenecks . " " it could make a significant impact on the economic success of the country , " süssmuth said . difficult to gain acceptance interior minister otto schily - who created the expert commission last year - received its report with noticeable reserve , saying he 'd give the recommendations " careful consideration . "
but he added that with 4.35 million unemployed people in germany , it would be difficult to gain backing for an influx of immigrants . the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz , has spoken out against an influx of skilled foreign labor . " the work that is available in germany must be done by germans and the non-germans already living here , " he said during a radio interview on wednesday .
" i 'm against opening the doors for immigration in our labor market .
this would lead to too much discontent in germany . " flaws in new law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission says skilled foreign workers are needed in several sectors of the economy .
the panel of experts ' recommendation to open the doors to 25,000 immigrants next year comes just over two months before germany 's new immigration law comes into effect . the law was agreed in june after years of bitter wrangling over how to strike the appropriate balance between security , humanitarian , and economic concerns .
in the end , the law allowed for a smaller inflow of immigrants than the government had originally planned . business leaders criticized the immigration compromise when it was passed , saying more free movement of labor and freedom to recruit skilled workers was needed for germany to remain competitive . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green card numbers below target germany 's much-touted green card program launched four years ago to meet the need for qualified it workers from abroad has been given to only 17,000 people .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .
like then , history will show that the war in iraq was also beneficial , perle said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .

" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .

whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "

perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .
" he would work hard to prove to his colleagues in germany , france , and other eu countries , that their opinion matters . " martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de my favorite candidate the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed .

the suggestion has already met with resistance . the independent expert commission said that qualified workers would be needed in sectors such as insurance and banking , the health industry , and engineering , adding that there was already a shortage of german workers with the necessary skills to fill jobs in those areas .
the head of the commission , conservative politician rita süssmuth , said germany needed to allow " limited and well-targeted immigration " to prevent " bottlenecks . " " it could make a significant impact on the economic success of the country , " süssmuth said . difficult to gain acceptance interior minister otto schily - who created the expert commission last year - received its report with noticeable reserve , saying he 'd give the recommendations " careful consideration . "
but he added that with 4.35 million unemployed people in germany , it would be difficult to gain backing for an influx of immigrants . the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz , has spoken out against an influx of skilled foreign labor . " the work that is available in germany must be done by germans and the non-germans already living here , " he said during a radio interview on wednesday .
" i 'm against opening the doors for immigration in our labor market .
this would lead to too much discontent in germany . " flaws in new law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission says skilled foreign workers are needed in several sectors of the economy .
the panel of experts ' recommendation to open the doors to 25,000 immigrants next year comes just over two months before germany 's new immigration law comes into effect . the law was agreed in june after years of bitter wrangling over how to strike the appropriate balance between security , humanitarian , and economic concerns .
in the end , the law allowed for a smaller inflow of immigrants than the government had originally planned . business leaders criticized the immigration compromise when it was passed , saying more free movement of labor and freedom to recruit skilled workers was needed for germany to remain competitive . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green card numbers below target germany 's much-touted green card program launched four years ago to meet the need for qualified it workers from abroad has been given to only 17,000 people .

" maybe this diary will be a disappointment to you because it does n't contain facts , " deen wrote to van den berg .
" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .

what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .

parts of the diary will be on display for one day on october 30 in tilburg , and the archive is negotiating with museums to show it elsewhere . " -lrb- deen -rrb- kept the secret diary for her boyfriend in order to help him understand what she was experiencing , " said yvonne weling of the tilburg regional archive .
deen , her brother , father and mother were shipped off to a nazi concentration camp in sobibor , poland , that july .
all four later died at the camp .
helga was recorded as having died on july 16 , 1943 . weling said van den berg had written back to deen on some of the blank pages of the diary , concealed within a school notebook marked " physics " and apparently transferred the diary back and forth between the pair .
he kept the diary after deen was deported , and saved it along with a lock of his girlfriend 's hair . no facts but emotions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helga deen .
in the diary , deen recorded some of her day-to-day experiences for van den berg , but even more of her emotions , weling said .
" maybe this diary will be a disappointment to you because it does n't contain facts , " deen wrote to van den berg .
" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .
" we are homeless , countryless and we have to adjust ourselves to that way of life .
what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .
" he would work hard to prove to his colleagues in germany , france , and other eu countries , that their opinion matters . " martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de my favorite candidate the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .
" the most important thing is to transport the whole complexity and horror of the wall - including the system that was behind it . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .
" the most important thing is to transport the whole complexity and horror of the wall - including the system that was behind it . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .

media portrayals of germans have misled generations of british , something joschka fischer is concerned about . such is the power of television that audiences all over the world have adopted many phrases from their favorite shows and use them freely in their everyday language .
the british are no exception .
there seems to be a quote or reference for every occasion . for example , when in the company of germans , many a pop-cultured brit will turn to a compatriot and whisper , " do n't mention the war . "
instantly , if said compatriot is on the same wavelength , an image of hotel manager basil fawlty goose-stepping across the dining room of his establishment as german guests gape in horror will come to mind - followed shortly after by knowing sniggers . a deeply outdated view of germany shows such as ' fawlty towers ' , ' auf wiedersehen , pet ' and ' blackadder ' have had such an influence on the british view of germany that german foreign minister joschka fischer was inclined to mention his concerns while on a visit to london on wednesday .
fischer said that british people have a deeply outdated view of germany , still viewing it as the land of the " prussian goosestep " , an image cemented in the national consciousness by john cleese 's manic hotelier . he added that when young germans saw their nation portrayed in the british media , it was a place they did not recognize .
" my children are 20 and 25 , and when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " he said in an interview with bbc radio .
" germany has changed in a democratic , positive way .
today this is a democracy .
two or three generations have grown up as real democrats , " fischer noted . " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goosestep works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany in the younger generation - even my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " german broadcaster rtl is considering remaking a number of ' fawlty towers ' episodes for german tv but will omit basil 's infamous xenophobic tirade . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany cool for the brits the british on the whole have a negative view of the germans .
but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .
like then , history will show that the war in iraq was also beneficial , perle said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "

" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .

what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .

the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .
" the most important thing is to transport the whole complexity and horror of the wall - including the system that was behind it . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .

" " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .
" he would work hard to prove to his colleagues in germany , france , and other eu countries , that their opinion matters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.10.2004 german carmakers face a bumpy ride as the automechanika industry fair for automobile suppliers kicks off in frankfurt , germany , many in the branch will be looking to the country 's eastern neighbors for a sign of the future .
recent studies indicate that the traditional german industry is outsourcing more and more of the business to eastern europe and china in search of cheaper manufacturing conditions .
is germany 's car industry at risk ?
as more and more carmakers contemplate moving abroad where wages are lower and the labor market flexibler , many say germany could lose its position as a leading automobile manufacturing center if politicians and economists do n't do more to counteract the trend .
the problems for the struggling industry are many faceted - they include stiff international competition , a weak dollar-euro exchange , a clining domestic market , high personnel costs and inflexible labor laws .
in the last year , two of germany 's leading carmakers , daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , have watched sales fall while fighting bitter battles with unions over contract negotiations .
in both cases , the companies threatened to slash jobs and move production abroad .

in both cases , the companies threatened to slash jobs and move production abroad .

there seems to be a quote or reference for every occasion . for example , when in the company of germans , many a pop-cultured brit will turn to a compatriot and whisper , " do n't mention the war . "

fischer said that british people have a deeply outdated view of germany , still viewing it as the land of the " prussian goosestep " , an image cemented in the national consciousness by john cleese 's manic hotelier . he added that when young germans saw their nation portrayed in the british media , it was a place they did not recognize .
" my children are 20 and 25 , and when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " he said in an interview with bbc radio .
" germany has changed in a democratic , positive way .
today this is a democracy .
two or three generations have grown up as real democrats , " fischer noted . " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goosestep works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany in the younger generation - even my generation - nobody knows how to perform it .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 20.10.2004 former us treasurer campaigns for kerry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenthal believes kerry would restore us - german relations director of the jewish museum berlin and former secretary of the us treasury w. michael blumenthal has hit the campaign trail .
at home and abroad , he 's busy touting for " his man " in the white house : john kerry . michael blumenthal wears his political confession on his sleeve - or rather , on his lapel .
pinned there is a red , white and blue button with " john kerry for president ! " spelled out in big letters .
speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , blumenthal explained why he thinks a president kerry would be better for the united states and the world than president george w. bush has been . bush 's economic policy , he said , is both inadequate and wrong . " the president has followed an economic policy in which he introduced three tax cuts , even during the iraq war , " blumenthal told dw-world .
" it 's unprecedented to burden the budget with huge losses in income at the same time that you 're fighting a war which requires huge military expenditures . " he added that tax cuts for the rich fail to stimulate the economy , and that the current high us deficit poses a threat to the global economy . blumenthal 's opinion carries a great deal of weight .
born in oranienburg , germany in 1926 , he moved to the us at age 21 , where he rose through the ranks to become an economics professor at princeton university .
in his political career , he was an economics advisor to presidents kennedy and johnson , and secretary of the treasury under the carter administration . politics for the people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis .
blumenthal says kerry would usher in an era of politics for the masses , not just for the wealthy .
" he 's reverse the tax cuts for the top earners - those who earn more than $ 200,000 -lrb- € 160,000 -rrb- .
he 's already made that clear , " blumenthal said . kerry has also promised to improve health and social welfare policies .
around 45 million people in the us currently live without proper health insurance .
kerry has promised to integrate 25 million of those people back into the health care system . in blumenthal 's view , the other two main weaknesses in the bush administration are related : the lack of social policies and the iraq war . " the difficulties in financing social programs and job creation programs in part arose because of the enormous sums that are being spent in iraq , " blumenthal said . pre-emptive strikes blumenthal defended his candidate against allegations that he would not perform as well as the incumbent on matters of homeland security .
the bush administration has adopted a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against any country it perceives to be a threat to america . " if the danger is so great , then kerry would also use all the means at his disposal to defend america , " blumenthal said , meaning kerry has n't ruled out pre-emptive strikes .
" but he would only attack as a last resort . " that , for him , is the decisive difference between kerry and bush , who he says attacked iraq without any solid intelligence about how big a threat it was .
post-attack , it 's become clear that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , nor was saddam hussein as powerful as the bush administration said . strengthening alliances despite the controversial doctrine of pre-emptive strikes , blumenthal says a kerry presidency would go a long way to mending american relations with germany and other european countries . " i believe that he would really work hard to restore the transatlantic ties that have worked so well during the last 50 years , during the cold war , " blumenthal said .
" he would work hard to prove to his colleagues in germany , france , and other eu countries , that their opinion matters .

" the european commission has concluded its long-standing investigation into the transfer of public assets , in the early ' 90s , to seven german regional public banks by ordering germany to recover € 3 billion plus interest , " a statement said . " these decisions close a very long and painful dispute between private and public banks in germany , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said . he added that his ruling would create " a level playing field in the sector , which is in the interest of businesses operating in germany , of the consumers / taxpayers , and of the banks themselves as it removes the uncertainty which had been hanging upon them for too long . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro symbol in front of the european central bank in frankfurt under legislation introduced at the start of the 1990s , german banks were required to build up substantial capital to maintain new minimum levels of solvency . westlb and six other public banks were given the money by their regional governments , which partly or fully own the banks , through transfers of public housing and other assets . that prompted a complaint to brussels from the association of german private banks , which also had to increase their solvency ratios without being able to draw on public funds . westlb , germany 's biggest public bank , was ordered by the commission to repay € 979 million plus interest . the other six banks targeted by the investigation , with their repayment amounts , are the landesbank berlin -lrb- € 810 million plus interest -rrb- , norddeutsche landesbank -lrb- € 472 million plus interest -rrb- , landesbank schleswig-holstein -lrb- € 432 million plus interest -rrb- , bayerische landesbank -lrb- € 260 million plus interest -rrb- , hamburgische landesbank -lrb- € 90 million plus interest -rrb- and landesbank hessen-thüringen -lrb- € 6 million plus interest -rrb- . deutsche post monopoly fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post : a monopoly ?
the situation between the european union and germany over illegal aid is just the latest in a line of recent clashes between the bloc 's governing body and its biggest economy . the commission on wednesday also issued a two-month ultimatum to germany to improve competition in the country 's postal sector . the commission wants to force open germany 's postal system to more competition after the german government 's refusal to give competitors of deutsche post access to the so-called " post-preparation services market , " according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the commercial collection , sorting and franking of letters under 100 grams is currently exclusively guaranteed to deutsche post under postal laws .

" the european commission has concluded its long-standing investigation into the transfer of public assets , in the early ' 90s , to seven german regional public banks by ordering germany to recover € 3 billion plus interest , " a statement said . " these decisions close a very long and painful dispute between private and public banks in germany , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said . he added that his ruling would create " a level playing field in the sector , which is in the interest of businesses operating in germany , of the consumers / taxpayers , and of the banks themselves as it removes the uncertainty which had been hanging upon them for too long . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro symbol in front of the european central bank in frankfurt under legislation introduced at the start of the 1990s , german banks were required to build up substantial capital to maintain new minimum levels of solvency . westlb and six other public banks were given the money by their regional governments , which partly or fully own the banks , through transfers of public housing and other assets . that prompted a complaint to brussels from the association of german private banks , which also had to increase their solvency ratios without being able to draw on public funds . westlb , germany 's biggest public bank , was ordered by the commission to repay € 979 million plus interest . the other six banks targeted by the investigation , with their repayment amounts , are the landesbank berlin -lrb- € 810 million plus interest -rrb- , norddeutsche landesbank -lrb- € 472 million plus interest -rrb- , landesbank schleswig-holstein -lrb- € 432 million plus interest -rrb- , bayerische landesbank -lrb- € 260 million plus interest -rrb- , hamburgische landesbank -lrb- € 90 million plus interest -rrb- and landesbank hessen-thüringen -lrb- € 6 million plus interest -rrb- . deutsche post monopoly fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post : a monopoly ?
the situation between the european union and germany over illegal aid is just the latest in a line of recent clashes between the bloc 's governing body and its biggest economy . the commission on wednesday also issued a two-month ultimatum to germany to improve competition in the country 's postal sector . the commission wants to force open germany 's postal system to more competition after the german government 's refusal to give competitors of deutsche post access to the so-called " post-preparation services market , " according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the commercial collection , sorting and franking of letters under 100 grams is currently exclusively guaranteed to deutsche post under postal laws .
the newspaper said the commission 's move threatens to dismantle the german postal monopoly before its planned end in 2007/08 . deposit plan also under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations of discrimination against imports may land germany in court .
the eu and germany are also at loggerheads over its beleaguered can and bottle deposit law .
the commission is threatening to take the german government to court in a third case unless it changes a law on deposits charged on non-reusable containers of beverages such as heineken nv beer and nestle sa 's vittel mineral water . germany is being sued over objections that the deposit discriminates against imports , which are more likely to be shipped in non-refillable cans and plastic bottles . " in practice , it 's very difficult for consumers to take the empty packaging back to a shop and get their deposit back , " jonathan todd , a commission spokesman , told a brussels news conference recently .
" this has the effect of being an obstacle to trade in the internal market . " efforts being made to avoid court the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , voted last week to simplify legislation levying deposits on beverage containers , excluding packaging considered environmentally friendly and bringing in a flat-rate deposit . the bundesrat voted in favor of a motion put forward by the state of bavaria to levy the deposits on all containers except those for wine , liquor , alcohol and milk , while exempting packaging such as tubular polyethylene bags , cartons and stand-up pouches .
the plan is similar to existing government proposals to change a system that levies deposits at different rates only on specific types of drinks . the european commission is delaying action for three months because " they are seriously considering changing the system , " todd said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .
" neither the russians nor the americans actively support the eu three deal , " said one western diplomat about the g8 meeting . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .

the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .

" the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .
like then , history will show that the war in iraq was also beneficial , perle said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry waves as president bush looks on at the start of the presidential debate in st. louis , friday , oct .
8 , 2004 .
" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .
like then , history will show that the war in iraq was also beneficial , perle said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.10.2004 brits out of -lrb- goose -rrb- step with modern german image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleese 's infamous tirade is missing from the german ' fawlty towers ' thousands of shocked britons return from germany amazed at not seeing a single example of " goose-stepping " .
media portrayals of germans have misled generations of british , something joschka fischer is concerned about . such is the power of television that audiences all over the world have adopted many phrases from their favorite shows and use them freely in their everyday language .
the british are no exception .
there seems to be a quote or reference for every occasion . for example , when in the company of germans , many a pop-cultured brit will turn to a compatriot and whisper , " do n't mention the war . "
instantly , if said compatriot is on the same wavelength , an image of hotel manager basil fawlty goose-stepping across the dining room of his establishment as german guests gape in horror will come to mind - followed shortly after by knowing sniggers . a deeply outdated view of germany shows such as ' fawlty towers ' , ' auf wiedersehen , pet ' and ' blackadder ' have had such an influence on the british view of germany that german foreign minister joschka fischer was inclined to mention his concerns while on a visit to london on wednesday .
fischer said that british people have a deeply outdated view of germany , still viewing it as the land of the " prussian goosestep " , an image cemented in the national consciousness by john cleese 's manic hotelier . he added that when young germans saw their nation portrayed in the british media , it was a place they did not recognize .
" my children are 20 and 25 , and when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " he said in an interview with bbc radio .
" germany has changed in a democratic , positive way .
today this is a democracy .

media portrayals of germans have misled generations of british , something joschka fischer is concerned about . such is the power of television that audiences all over the world have adopted many phrases from their favorite shows and use them freely in their everyday language .
the british are no exception .
there seems to be a quote or reference for every occasion . for example , when in the company of germans , many a pop-cultured brit will turn to a compatriot and whisper , " do n't mention the war . "
instantly , if said compatriot is on the same wavelength , an image of hotel manager basil fawlty goose-stepping across the dining room of his establishment as german guests gape in horror will come to mind - followed shortly after by knowing sniggers . a deeply outdated view of germany shows such as ' fawlty towers ' , ' auf wiedersehen , pet ' and ' blackadder ' have had such an influence on the british view of germany that german foreign minister joschka fischer was inclined to mention his concerns while on a visit to london on wednesday .
fischer said that british people have a deeply outdated view of germany , still viewing it as the land of the " prussian goosestep " , an image cemented in the national consciousness by john cleese 's manic hotelier . he added that when young germans saw their nation portrayed in the british media , it was a place they did not recognize .
" my children are 20 and 25 , and when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " he said in an interview with bbc radio .
" germany has changed in a democratic , positive way .
today this is a democracy .
two or three generations have grown up as real democrats , " fischer noted . " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goosestep works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany in the younger generation - even my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " german broadcaster rtl is considering remaking a number of ' fawlty towers ' episodes for german tv but will omit basil 's infamous xenophobic tirade . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany cool for the brits the british on the whole have a negative view of the germans .

is germany 's car industry at risk ?
as more and more carmakers contemplate moving abroad where wages are lower and the labor market flexibler , many say germany could lose its position as a leading automobile manufacturing center if politicians and economists do n't do more to counteract the trend .
the problems for the struggling industry are many faceted - they include stiff international competition , a weak dollar-euro exchange , a clining domestic market , high personnel costs and inflexible labor laws .
in the last year , two of germany 's leading carmakers , daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , have watched sales fall while fighting bitter battles with unions over contract negotiations .
in both cases , the companies threatened to slash jobs and move production abroad .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .

in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .

" we have worked very closely to try and deal with the deep concerns we have about iran 's nuclear program , " british foreign secretary jack straw said following talks in london with his german counterpart joschka fischer .
" iran has yet to give us the confidence we need about its intentions , " he said at a joint press conference with fischer , who endorsed the sentiments . " i want to underline that we are very much on the same track on iran .
we are very concerned about the developments and i think it 's very important that there is not a miscalculation in tehran , " the german minister said . call for suspension of uranium enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo iran stands accused of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge it denies .
in september , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- called on iran to " immediately " widen its suspension of uranium enrichment to include all uranium enrichment-related activities , which it has so far refused to do so . iran faces a november 25 deadline , after which it risks being referred to the united nations security council for further action .
immediate action was needed , straw stressed , saying : " we ca n't go on indefinitely . " " iran can still give us confidence before the next meeting of the iaea 's board on november 25 by introducing an indefinite suspension of its enrichment and processing-related activities . " confidence can not yet be restored earlier , another british minister urged tehran to " act decisively " if it was to avoid being referred to the security council .
" confidence can not be restored unless iran agrees to suspend its fuel cycle activity , including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion , " international security minister denis macshane said at a meeting in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in iran is at the center of the row .
" they are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation program but would give iran the technologies which would help it towards a military nuclear capability . " " iran faces a clear choice , " macshane said .
" it can choose to live up to its commitments , comply in full with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's resolutions , including by putting in place a full and lasting suspension and reap the benefits of the international confidence this would create .
or it can spurn the chance to reassure the international community . " he added : " in that case the board will need to discuss additional measures , including very probably referral to the un security council . " " carrots and sticks " plan rebuffed by iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the g8 nations plus the eu flag .
this latest meeting follows friday 's session of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrial nations , where the european union presented its plans to use a " carrots and sticks " approach with tehran , offering incentives in exchange for a verified suspension and eventual termination of uranium enrichment . iranian officials almost immediately rejected any such plan , saying that incentives used in dealing with other states such as libya would not work with iran . one western diplomat said that at friday 's g8 meeting , the us response to the eu was one of deep skepticism about whether iran would comply with the terms of the deal , which is aimed at cutting off iran 's ability to make bomb-grade uranium .
" neither the russians nor the americans actively support the eu three deal , " said one western diplomat about the g8 meeting . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday .

the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .

“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .

the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .

and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .
" the most important thing is to transport the whole complexity and horror of the wall - including the system that was behind it . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .

" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .

what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .

deen , her brother , father and mother were shipped off to a nazi concentration camp in sobibor , poland , that july .
all four later died at the camp .
helga was recorded as having died on july 16 , 1943 . weling said van den berg had written back to deen on some of the blank pages of the diary , concealed within a school notebook marked " physics " and apparently transferred the diary back and forth between the pair .
he kept the diary after deen was deported , and saved it along with a lock of his girlfriend 's hair . no facts but emotions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helga deen .
in the diary , deen recorded some of her day-to-day experiences for van den berg , but even more of her emotions , weling said .
" maybe this diary will be a disappointment to you because it does n't contain facts , " deen wrote to van den berg .
" but maybe you 'll be glad that you find me in it : conflict , doubt , desperation , shyness , emptiness . " among other entries , deen 's diary recorded the relief she felt after her family was once not selected for deportation - and the fear they might be chosen next time .
" we are homeless , countryless and we have to adjust ourselves to that way of life .
what we have seen in these last months is indescribable , and for someone who has n't been there , unimaginable , " she wrote . a document of the human spirit " i feel so alone .
every day we see freedom from behind barbed wire , " deen wrote in one extract .
on june 6 , 1943 , only weeks before she was deported , she wrote : " i ca n't stand it any more but if my willpower dies , i die too . " the diary 's final entry , written on july 2 , 1943 , contains a mysteriously illegible phrase ending " ... between the packages , because we 're leaving soon , " apparently referring to an attempt to smuggle the diary out of the internment camp in vught for the last time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank .
the diary has drawn comparisons with the most famous holocaust-era diary , the one written by anne frank , the daughter of a german-jewish family who hid in an amsterdam attic for 25 months .
the diary of anne frank went on to become an international best-seller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should anne frank become dutch ?
a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis .
-lrb- october 8 , 2004 -rrb- anne frank : the face of the holocaust she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .
" we can not afford to wait too long , " he said .

" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .
" the moment of precisely when a nation is justified in acting in its own defense can only be answered case by case , " he said .
" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "
a cowboy or savior ?
" this president is straight forward , he says what he thinks , " and he acts accordingly , perle said in a reference to the european characterization of bush as a cowboy .
" what you see is his conviction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush frequently puts on a cowboy hat to show his downhome connection to texas .
perle reminded the german audience that former president ronald reagan , under whom he served as assistant secretary of defense , was also frequently referred to as a gun-slinging cowboy , even when he called for tearing down the berlin wall .

the presidential debates are over , and it 's still a neck-and-neck race in the us .
in germany , john kerry is clearly the preferred choice - a trend former us defense advisor richard perle would like to see reversed . speaking at a gathering of the american academy in berlin this week , neo-conservative foreign policy expert richard perle was emphatic about who should be the next president of the united states : george w. bush .
since the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , it is obvious the world is at war , he told a crowd gathered to hear arguments for and against the incumbent and his democratic opponent .
despite the close race in the united states , in europe john kerry has already won the polls .
foreign policy , and in particular the war in iraq , are the key issues on this side of the atlantic .
and for the vast majority , bush 's track record speaks against him ; some 80 percent of europeans want to see kerry win the election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george bush during a television debate in florida but those statistics could not deter perle from sounding off on the reasons why germans should support bush for president .
under the motto " my favorite candidate , " the former presidential advisor and staunch advocate of the iraq war argued that bush 's defeat would jeopardize not only the security of the united states but of the democratic world .
" we can not afford to wait " in the face of the growing threat of international terrorism , george w. bush has adopted the right strategy of invading afghanistan and iraq , perle said , making no secret of his support for washington 's policy of pre-emptive action .

" we are locked in combat with people who wish to destroy americans in order to realize a deeply ideological ambition which is the creation of an islamist universe , and they are prepared to die in that cause , " perle said and added that he had full trust in the current president to make the right decisions .

" i believe that president bush will deal with the dangers that are presented in these situations effectively , and i do n't have the same confidence in senator kerry . "
who is the better protector ?
the central question in the election is which president can best protect the americans , perle said .
whereas , the world knows which action the current president would take in the future , the democratic challenger is less clear-cut , preferring instead to consult allies and international organizations , perle said , adding that he did not put much faith in these institutions .
" the institutions and law have proven inadequate , " he said .
" the united nations ca n't even agree on a definition of terrorism , much less organize itself to oppose terrorism effectively , and international law can not reasonably be expected to apply to people who have a messianic vision and are prepared to die in order to inflict that . "

the suggestion has already met with resistance . the independent expert commission said that qualified workers would be needed in sectors such as insurance and banking , the health industry , and engineering , adding that there was already a shortage of german workers with the necessary skills to fill jobs in those areas .
the head of the commission , conservative politician rita süssmuth , said germany needed to allow " limited and well-targeted immigration " to prevent " bottlenecks . " " it could make a significant impact on the economic success of the country , " süssmuth said . difficult to gain acceptance interior minister otto schily - who created the expert commission last year - received its report with noticeable reserve , saying he 'd give the recommendations " careful consideration . "
but he added that with 4.35 million unemployed people in germany , it would be difficult to gain backing for an influx of immigrants . the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz , has spoken out against an influx of skilled foreign labor . " the work that is available in germany must be done by germans and the non-germans already living here , " he said during a radio interview on wednesday .
" i 'm against opening the doors for immigration in our labor market .
this would lead to too much discontent in germany . " flaws in new law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission says skilled foreign workers are needed in several sectors of the economy .
the panel of experts ' recommendation to open the doors to 25,000 immigrants next year comes just over two months before germany 's new immigration law comes into effect . the law was agreed in june after years of bitter wrangling over how to strike the appropriate balance between security , humanitarian , and economic concerns .
in the end , the law allowed for a smaller inflow of immigrants than the government had originally planned . business leaders criticized the immigration compromise when it was passed , saying more free movement of labor and freedom to recruit skilled workers was needed for germany to remain competitive . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : green card numbers below target germany 's much-touted green card program launched four years ago to meet the need for qualified it workers from abroad has been given to only 17,000 people .

"
the symbol of communist oppression returns as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie . on a rainy october afternoon , rainer p. stood clad in a green raincoat of the kind worn by border guards of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and allowed himself to be photographed by a group of tourists . “ business is good , ” he told dw-world , pointing to his wares of russian fur hats , green gdr police caps , a pile of medals , coins and other cold war insignia .
“ you can almost always count on that here . ” “ here ” is checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin ’ s most famous cold war symbol .
and it ’ s not hard to follow rainer p. ’ s business logic . every few minutes , huge busloads of tourists alight at the checkpoint charlie museum that documents the spectacular escape bids undertaken by gdr citizens , disappear into the scores of souvenir shops and snack bars lining either side of the street and photograph the formidable “ you are now leaving the american sector ” sign and mock us army checkpoint built in 2001 . “ a monument to peace ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goings-on are viewed distastefully by many berliners as a crass tourist attraction .
and , in recent weeks the city ’ s politicians have been up in arms over a new plan by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , to resurrect a 140-meter strip of the berlin wall a few steps from its original location near the former us army checkpoint . covered by huge plastic sheets to keep away onlookers , work is already underway on setting up the 120 concrete slabs , preserved by alexandra hildebrandt ’ s late husband and founder of the museum , on vacant land leased from a bank . “ this will be a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall , ” hildebrandt told dw-world .
“ but , also a protest against the city of berlin for the trivialization of the place . ” hildebrandt , whose museum already enjoys cult status with 3,500 visitors a day , said her aim was not to maximize profits , but to build something worthy of the site ’ s significance .
“ the city of berlin ignored it and allowed the site to turn into a rubbish dump , ” hildebrandt said . she however , refused to say whether the rebuilding of the wall was an “ art exhibit ” or confirm rumors she was planning a replica watchtower complete with a barbed-wire perimeter . “ disneyland ” project there are few takers for hildebrandt ’ s controversial plans .
walter momper , president of the berlin state parliament last week lashed at what he described as a “ disneyland ” project . “ it ’ s an obvious commercial trick that we don ’ t consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , ” manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world .
she added that the city was examining “ legal steps should mrs. hildebrandt renege on her promise ” to remove the installation by the new year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have questioned the historical accuracy of the undertaking .
the artist initiative east side gallery , which has painted over the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall in berlin ’ s friedrichshain district , have distanced themselves from the rebuilding plans , saying it distorts history by not even being resurrected on its original location . maria nooke , head of the documentation center at the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , said checkpoint charlie was certainly spectacular with its documentation of the cold war espionage system and its display of nifty gadgets used by gdr citizens to try and escape . “ but not all memorials can be that way , ” nooke told dw-world .
“ the problem with checkpoint charlie is that it fails to convey the entire horror of the wall .
it offers just an exciting easy-to-market landscape , but it doesn ’ t make the tourist pause and think about the wall . coherent wall concept needed even as the row over rebuilding a part of the wall simmers , some say that the dispute has helped underline the need to draw up a comprehensive wall concept for the city in light of its enduring magnetism for tourists . almost 15 years since it was almost completely pulled down , awareness is now increasing among politicians and the general public that the remains should be preserved , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ the wall was a symbol of repression and division for people on both sides for so long , ” nooke said .
“ you can imagine the zeal with which they tore it down .
it ’ s only much later that people realized it was still such a tourist attraction in the city and thus legitimate to preserve . ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture , which plans to initiate a public debate over how to deal with wall memorials and remnants , said that the department was also working on an electronic audio guide which would lead tourists to the historic places and provide detailed information . “ there hasn ’ t been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs on the wall victims , ” krüssen told dw-world .
“ it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . ” the whole spectacle at checkpoint charlie , which is privately owned , had spurred the city to come up with a more decent approach to the memory of the wall , she added . conveying the full horror nooke , however , cautioned that any concept had to keep in mind that each wall memorial was a strong reminder of a certain facet of the gdr . “ for instance , checkpoint charlie documents allied war history while the bernauer strasse memorial captures the destruction of everyday lives in the gdr , " nooke said .
" that can ’ t be tampered with . ”
she added that staying true to the facts was paramount . “ we can ’ t always be thinking of presenting the tourists with something interesting , " she said .
" the most important thing is to transport the whole complexity and horror of the wall - including the system that was behind it . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .

mr yudhoyono is probably best known internationally for his leading role in indonesia 's fight against terrorism in the wake of the bali bombing in 2002 .
his speech on the anniversary of the attack was seen as one of the strongest delivered by any indonesian leader on an issue which is still politically sensitive .
but critics say the former military commander is surprisingly indecisive , tending to consider all perspectives and opinions before making up his mind .
budi santoso , chairman of mr yudhoyono 's democrat party , agrees he is a thoughtful man , but says he is capable of making decisive moves when necessary .
" for example , while other presidential candidates where still looking about for suitable running mates , susilo had already chosen jusuf kalla as his vice president , " mr santoso said . "
i understand what -lsb- people -rsb- feel ; i know their expectations " susilo bambang yudhoyono the man dubbed " the thinking general " was born in 1949 in east java .
the son of a retired army lieutenant , susilo bambang yudhoyono graduated from indonesia 's military academy in 1973 .
two years later indonesian security forces invaded east timor .
as he rose through the ranks , mr yudhoyono completed several tours of duty in the territory .
by the time of east timor 's violent transition to independence in 1999 , he had been promoted to chief of territorial affairs .
as such he would have reported directly to gen wiranto , the former head of the armed forces who has now been indicted for war crimes by a special tribunal in east timor .
but there has never been any attempt to bring charges against mr yudhoyono .
his supporters say he was not part of the inner circle of military commanders accused of allowing the violence to spread .
honorary award in fact , susilo bambang yudhoyono never quite achieved the highest levels in the military to which he aspired .
his four star general status was an honorary award given to him when he left the army to join the government of abdurrahman wahid in 2000 .
he started as minister for mines but was soon promoted to chief minister for security and political affairs .
a year later he found himself in conflict with his boss .
facing impeachment , president wahid asked mr yudhoyono to declare a state of emergency .
mr yudhoyono declined , and promptly lost his job .
in march 2004 , history repeated itself .
mr yudhoyono , reappointed as senior political and security minister under president megawati , stepped down after a very public spat with the president and her husband .
the decision to resign , according to denny ja , executive director of the indonesian survey institute , has paid off handsomely .
" even though sby was a senior member of a deeply unpopular government , he has come to be seen as a victim of that government rather than part of it , " said mr ja .
being forced from office under successive presidents seems to have enhanced mr yudhoyono 's reputation as a man of principle , willing to sacrifice his own ambitions for the values he believes in .
that - and the fact he looks good on tv - could also have proved an important factor in his election win , according to denny ja .
" you have to remember that 60 % of the population only graduated from elementary school , so they do n't investigate candidates too closely , " mr ja said .

a strong image is seen as key mr yudhoyono is probably best known internationally for his leading role in indonesia 's fight against terrorism in the wake of the bali bombing in 2002 .
his speech on the anniversary of the attack was seen as one of the strongest delivered by any indonesian leader on an issue which is still politically sensitive .
but critics say the former military commander is surprisingly indecisive , tending to consider all perspectives and opinions before making up his mind .
budi santoso , chairman of mr yudhoyono 's democrat party , agrees he is a thoughtful man , but says he is capable of making decisive moves when necessary .
" for example , while other presidential candidates where still looking about for suitable running mates , susilo had already chosen jusuf kalla as his vice president , " mr santoso said .
i understand what -lsb- people -rsb- feel ; i know their expectations susilo bambang yudhoyono the man dubbed " the thinking general " was born in 1949 in east java .
the son of a retired army lieutenant , susilo bambang yudhoyono graduated from indonesia 's military academy in 1973 .
two years later indonesian security forces invaded east timor .
as he rose through the ranks , mr yudhoyono completed several tours of duty in the territory .
by the time of east timor 's violent transition to independence in 1999 , he had been promoted to chief of territorial affairs .
as such he would have reported directly to gen wiranto , the former head of the armed forces who has now been indicted for war crimes by a special tribunal in east timor .
but there has never been any attempt to bring charges against mr yudhoyono .
his supporters say he was not part of the inner circle of military commanders accused of allowing the violence to spread .
honorary award in fact , susilo bambang yudhoyono never quite achieved the highest levels in the military to which he aspired .
his four star general status was an honorary award given to him when he left the army to join the government of abdurrahman wahid in 2000 .
he started as minister for mines but was soon promoted to chief minister for security and political affairs .
a year later he found himself in conflict with his boss .
facing impeachment , president wahid asked mr yudhoyono to declare a state of emergency .
mr yudhoyono declined , and promptly lost his job .
in march 2004 , history repeated itself .
mr yudhoyono , reappointed as senior political and security minister under president megawati , stepped down after a very public spat with the president and her husband .

a strong image is seen as key mr yudhoyono is probably best known internationally for his leading role in indonesia 's fight against terrorism in the wake of the bali bombing in 2002 .
his speech on the anniversary of the attack was seen as one of the strongest delivered by any indonesian leader on an issue which is still politically sensitive .
but critics say the former military commander is surprisingly indecisive , tending to consider all perspectives and opinions before making up his mind .
budi santoso , chairman of mr yudhoyono 's democrat party , agrees he is a thoughtful man , but says he is capable of making decisive moves when necessary .
" for example , while other presidential candidates where still looking about for suitable running mates , susilo had already chosen jusuf kalla as his vice president , " mr santoso said .
i understand what -lsb- people -rsb- feel ; i know their expectations susilo bambang yudhoyono the man dubbed " the thinking general " was born in 1949 in east java .
the son of a retired army lieutenant , susilo bambang yudhoyono graduated from indonesia 's military academy in 1973 .
two years later indonesian security forces invaded east timor .
as he rose through the ranks , mr yudhoyono completed several tours of duty in the territory .
by the time of east timor 's violent transition to independence in 1999 , he had been promoted to chief of territorial affairs .
as such he would have reported directly to gen wiranto , the former head of the armed forces who has now been indicted for war crimes by a special tribunal in east timor .
but there has never been any attempt to bring charges against mr yudhoyono .
his supporters say he was not part of the inner circle of military commanders accused of allowing the violence to spread .
honorary award in fact , susilo bambang yudhoyono never quite achieved the highest levels in the military to which he aspired .
his four star general status was an honorary award given to him when he left the army to join the government of abdurrahman wahid in 2000 .
he started as minister for mines but was soon promoted to chief minister for security and political affairs .
a year later he found himself in conflict with his boss .
facing impeachment , president wahid asked mr yudhoyono to declare a state of emergency .
mr yudhoyono declined , and promptly lost his job .
in march 2004 , history repeated itself .
mr yudhoyono , reappointed as senior political and security minister under president megawati , stepped down after a very public spat with the president and her husband .
the decision to resign , according to denny ja , executive director of the indonesian survey institute , has paid off handsomely .
mr yudhoyono was a minister in mrs megawati 's government " even though sby was a senior member of a deeply unpopular government , he has come to be seen as a victim of that government rather than part of it , " said mr ja .
being forced from office under successive presidents seems to have enhanced mr yudhoyono 's reputation as a man of principle , willing to sacrifice his own ambitions for the values he believes in .
that - and the fact he looks good on tv - could also have proved an important factor in his election win , according to denny ja .
" you have to remember that 60 % of the population only graduated from elementary school , so they do n't investigate candidates too closely , " mr ja said .

earnings for the three months to september were $ 479m -lrb- £ 268m -rrb- , up from $ 116m a year earlier , the firm said .
motorola shares dropped during extended trading in new york despite sales jumping 26 % to $ 8.62bn.
analysts said they had expected better data and raised concerns that the firm had lost some market share to rivals .
crowded marketplace competition in the industry has increased , especially after leader nokia cut the cost of its handsets in the hope of winning new customers .
motorola also has seen firms such as samsung move closer , threatening its position as the world 's second-biggest mobile phone maker .
handset market share nokia 29.7 % motorola 15.8 % samsung 12.1 % siemens 6.9 % sony ericsson 6.6 % lg 6 % others 22.9 % figures are for second quarter of 2004 source : gartner " the company has outperformed expectations for a couple of quarters in a row , " said ed snyder , an analyst at charter equity research .
analysts were " looking for a repeat performance and they did n't get it . "
" so while motorola is doing phenomenally better than last year , expectations are for continued acceleration , not a status quo . "
across the board motorola 's mobile phones division - its largest single business - accounted for the bulk of its profits , generating some $ 390m in operating earnings .
the increase reflected the successful launch of 17 new handset models with colour displays and built-in cameras .
its semiconductor business notched up operating earnings of $ 82m , while sales rose 17 % on the year to $ 1.4bn.
chief executive ed zander said motorola 's prospects were " pretty solid and optimistic " .

the scottish trade union congress -lrb- stuc -rrb- - whose report coincides with national inspection day - is urging employers to check for hazards .
it found 39 % of workplaces with union safety reps had never been inspected by the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- or an environmental health officer .
only 42 % of companies had involved reps - despite a legal requirement to do so .
the stuc also found that 11 % of workplaces surveyed had not been inspected for more than three years .
nearly 40 % of safety reps were aware an inspector had visited their place of work but had not been spoken to during the visit .
the other key findings from the survey include : manufacturing companies -lrb- 49 % -rrb- and workplaces in the energy and water sector -lrb- 47 % -rrb- were the most likely to have been checked in the past year central government departments -lrb- 70 % -rrb- and financial sector firms -lrb- 61 % -rrb- were most likely never to have been inspected larger workplaces were more likely to have been visited , as 40 % of companies with more than 1,000 employees had been visited compared to 24 % for firms with less than 100 workers .
stuc assistant secretary ian tasker said : " sadly a visit from a safety inspector is still all too rare an occurrence for the overwhelming majority of employers .
" regular inspections are an ideal way of keeping firms on their toes , but at the current rate , they could wait years for an inspector to call .
" in the meantime , workers and members of the public are being put at risk . "
' extra resources ' mr tasker said that the fear of an imminent inspection was sufficient to make most employers get their safety act together .
but he said the threat was not enough to mend the ways of companies who are playing with their employees ' safety .
he added : " if we are serious about improving the poor workplace safety record , the government must allocate extra resources to the hse to enable them to increase the number of inspectors able to visit companies on a regular basis . "
the hse said it had to use its resources to the best of its ability .
a spokesman said : " any increase in resources would be a matter for the government .
management of health and safety in the workplace is primarily the duty of the employer hse spokesman " even with an increase in resources , we would still have to prioritise our work , concentrating on those industries deemed to be the most dangerous , for example the construction and agriculture centres .
" our priorities are to reduce deaths , injuries and ill-health among the workforce , and to meet government-set targets for doing so .
" that said , management of health and safety in the workplace is primarily the duty of the employer . "
earlier this year the work and pensions select committee report into the health and safety commission and hse recommended the number of inspectors be doubled .
national inspection day is part of european health and safety week , which runs until 22 october .
the stuc 's full focus on union safety reps survey will be available in november .

the scottish trade union congress -lrb- stuc -rrb- - whose report coincides with national inspection day - is urging employers to check for hazards .
it found 39 % of workplaces with union safety reps had never been inspected by the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- or an environmental health officer .
only 42 % of companies had involved reps - despite a legal requirement to do so .
the stuc also found that 11 % of workplaces surveyed had not been inspected for more than three years .
nearly 40 % of safety reps were aware an inspector had visited their place of work but had not been spoken to during the visit .
the other key findings from the survey include : manufacturing companies -lrb- 49 % -rrb- and workplaces in the energy and water sector -lrb- 47 % -rrb- were the most likely to have been checked in the past year central government departments -lrb- 70 % -rrb- and financial sector firms -lrb- 61 % -rrb- were most likely never to have been inspected larger workplaces were more likely to have been visited , as 40 % of companies with more than 1,000 employees had been visited compared to 24 % for firms with less than 100 workers .
stuc assistant secretary ian tasker said : " sadly a visit from a safety inspector is still all too rare an occurrence for the overwhelming majority of employers .
" regular inspections are an ideal way of keeping firms on their toes , but at the current rate , they could wait years for an inspector to call .
" in the meantime , workers and members of the public are being put at risk . "
' extra resources ' mr tasker said that the fear of an imminent inspection was sufficient to make most employers get their safety act together .
but he said the threat was not enough to mend the ways of companies who are playing with their employees ' safety .
he added : " if we are serious about improving the poor workplace safety record , the government must allocate extra resources to the hse to enable them to increase the number of inspectors able to visit companies on a regular basis . "
the hse said it had to use its resources to the best of its ability .
a spokesman said : " any increase in resources would be a matter for the government .
management of health and safety in the workplace is primarily the duty of the employer hse spokesman " even with an increase in resources , we would still have to prioritise our work , concentrating on those industries deemed to be the most dangerous , for example the construction and agriculture centres .
" our priorities are to reduce deaths , injuries and ill-health among the workforce , and to meet government-set targets for doing so .
" that said , management of health and safety in the workplace is primarily the duty of the employer . "
earlier this year the work and pensions select committee report into the health and safety commission and hse recommended the number of inspectors be doubled .

forty patients and eight staff at the royal devon and exeter hospital have been affected by the norwalk-type bug .
the virus outbreak started at the end of last week , and three wards have been closed to new admissions to help control the spread of infection .
the hospital trust says it has not yet postponed any operations , but the situation is being regularly reviewed .
the virus can be brought into hospitals by visitors and the trust is advising friends and families to stay away unless visits are absolutely necessary .
" we knew that diarrhoea and vomiting viruses were in the community and we were disappointed , though not surprised , when we had the first cases in the hospital at the end of last week , " said the hospital 's co-director of infection control , judy potter .
" in response we have closed three wards to new admissions and will restrict transfers from them to other health or social care settings .
" we know that people can bring the virus into the hospital , so we ask the family and friends of patients to stay away unless their visit is strictly necessary . "
she said people in need of emergency treatment or who had an appointment booked and had not been told directly to stay away should still attend the hospital .
but she asked that if people had been suffering with sickness or diarrhoea - or had been in contact with someone who had been - they should call the hospital and warn them before they arrived .
" please think twice before coming to visit a relative or friend , " said ms potter .

the virus can be brought into hospitals by visitors and the trust is advising friends and families to stay away unless visits are absolutely necessary .

this is higher than the 18 % figure that had previously been quoted .

the original bells at crediton parish church were out of tune , but have now been melted down to make 10 new bells .
a huge frame of steel girders , which will hold the bells , has been erected in the church tower and the bells will be hoisted up in the next few days .
if the work stays on schedule , it is hoped the new bells will start to ring out again at the end of the month .

the graduate diploma is in response to the need for more professionals to be trained in helping people with drug and alcohol problems .
according to figures from the welsh assembly government , 7,000 people were treated for substance misuse at centres across wales in the last year .
but thousands more do not register their addictions .
their problems can only be detected when they come into contact with other health workers .
" this is in response to the increasing number of people abusing substances who were contacting the clinical situation , " says damien black , a tutor at the university of glamorgan .
tutor damien black said substance misuse was a rising problem " we want people coming on the course who are from all sorts of agencies , people working in social services , housing , the criminal justice system , education .
" all sorts of people can benefit from this course . "
one of the students on the course has first-hand knowledge of the problems , after managing to overcome an addiction to amphetamines .
june corcoran , from bridgend , was an addict for 20 years , but is now training to be a counsellor .
" i 've been told by former clients of mine that they 'd prefer to have someone with prior knowledge of substance misuse working with them , " she said .
" otherwise they really do n't understand what it 's like to feed an addiction .
" that 's the difference , i do - i know what it 's like . "
the course aims to help overcome the stigma related to drug users , and puts the focus on dealing with them as human beings .
former addict june corcoran is training to be a counsellor lecturer trudi petersen says it is important to try and break down barriers to try and reach out to more people .

ryedale mp john greenway wants a change in the law to protect st hilda 's in ellerburn , near thornton-le-dale , from its four species of protected bat .
parishioners want to confine the bats to the roof , but need a special licence under current legislation .
mr greenway told the commons : " it is proving impossible for the bats and congregation to live side by side . "
dwindling congregation the 1,000-year-old saxon church is home to whiskered , pipistrelle , natterer 's and brown long-eared bats .
mr greenway says bat urine and faeces in the church are ruining the interior and causing congregation numbers to fall .
mr greenway told the commons the church faces closure due to the bats he said : " the congregation finds suggestions that somehow or other they should have to put up with the constant deluge of urine and faeces throughout every summer a trifle hard to take . "
at present , it is an offence to kill , injure or disturb any of britain 's 16 species of bat .
but mr greenway argues the species " can not be said to be close to extinction " as there are 24 natterer 's colonies in north yorkshire alone .
nature conservation minister ben bradshaw said that under existing laws churches could apply for licences which would allow them to move the bats .
he urged st hilda 's to apply for a licence , saying that he did not believe a general exemption for churches was justified when it appeared the situation could be dealt with by the law as it stands .
