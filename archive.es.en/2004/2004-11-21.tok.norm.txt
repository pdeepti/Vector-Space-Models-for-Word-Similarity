trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers . chauffeurs , champagne and cigars : are these part of a high-price package which can help traditional airlines hit back at budget operators ? the german airline lufthansa thinks so . it believes that well-heeled people will pay for a chauffeur to park their cars , valets to carry suitcases , for a massage and dinner followed by a cigar in luxurious surroundings before boarding . and how about being driven by mercedes s-class or a porsche cayenne to the aircraft while the other passengers struggle against wind and rain as they cross the tarmac ? the airline industry is in trouble , crisis some say , owing to years of low profitability , setbacks in the travel industry owing to terrorism and health scares , high fuel prices and particularly the onslaught of cheap flights . some airlines , the irish company aer lingus is an example , have decided to fight the budget operators at their own game . high living at a price but lufthansa has invested heavily in the belief that the best way to counter the budget airlines is to offer high living at a high price to high spenders .
instead of going for an offer of low-cost , queue and squeeze , it has opted for the lap of luxury . the airline is counting on taking the upmarket class a notch higher to win the customers with the money from other airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are supposed to relax in lufthansa 's new first class terminal .
but will they ?

trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers . chauffeurs , champagne and cigars : are these part of a high-price package which can help traditional airlines hit back at budget operators ? the german airline lufthansa thinks so . it believes that well-heeled people will pay for a chauffeur to park their cars , valets to carry suitcases , for a massage and dinner followed by a cigar in luxurious surroundings before boarding . and how about being driven by mercedes s-class or a porsche cayenne to the aircraft while the other passengers struggle against wind and rain as they cross the tarmac ? the airline industry is in trouble , crisis some say , owing to years of low profitability , setbacks in the travel industry owing to terrorism and health scares , high fuel prices and particularly the onslaught of cheap flights . some airlines , the irish company aer lingus is an example , have decided to fight the budget operators at their own game . high living at a price but lufthansa has invested heavily in the belief that the best way to counter the budget airlines is to offer high living at a high price to high spenders .
instead of going for an offer of low-cost , queue and squeeze , it has opted for the lap of luxury . the airline is counting on taking the upmarket class a notch higher to win the customers with the money from other airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are supposed to relax in lufthansa 's new first class terminal .

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko !

the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " russia-us rivalry the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , as both seek to ensure their man wins the presidency in a country that the west sees as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma -lrb- photo , right -rrb- that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- left -rrb- talks to his ukrainian counterpart leonid kuchma the first round on october 31 was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favoured the official candidate . russia , which under president vladimir putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , meanwhile is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbour in friendly hands . a polarized country tension has risen in this country , deeply polarized by the clash between the rival visions of ukraine 's future .
the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " russia-us rivalry the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , as both seek to ensure their man wins the presidency in a country that the west sees as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma -lrb- photo , right -rrb- that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- left -rrb- talks to his ukrainian counterpart leonid kuchma the first round on october 31 was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favoured the official candidate . russia , which under president vladimir putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , meanwhile is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbour in friendly hands . a polarized country tension has risen in this country , deeply polarized by the clash between the rival visions of ukraine 's future .
the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " russia-us rivalry the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , as both seek to ensure their man wins the presidency in a country that the west sees as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma -lrb- photo , right -rrb- that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- left -rrb- talks to his ukrainian counterpart leonid kuchma the first round on october 31 was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favoured the official candidate . russia , which under president vladimir putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , meanwhile is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbour in friendly hands . a polarized country tension has risen in this country , deeply polarized by the clash between the rival visions of ukraine 's future .
the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution .

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution .

the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers . chauffeurs , champagne and cigars : are these part of a high-price package which can help traditional airlines hit back at budget operators ? the german airline lufthansa thinks so . it believes that well-heeled people will pay for a chauffeur to park their cars , valets to carry suitcases , for a massage and dinner followed by a cigar in luxurious surroundings before boarding . and how about being driven by mercedes s-class or a porsche cayenne to the aircraft while the other passengers struggle against wind and rain as they cross the tarmac ? the airline industry is in trouble , crisis some say , owing to years of low profitability , setbacks in the travel industry owing to terrorism and health scares , high fuel prices and particularly the onslaught of cheap flights . some airlines , the irish company aer lingus is an example , have decided to fight the budget operators at their own game . high living at a price but lufthansa has invested heavily in the belief that the best way to counter the budget airlines is to offer high living at a high price to high spenders .
instead of going for an offer of low-cost , queue and squeeze , it has opted for the lap of luxury . the airline is counting on taking the upmarket class a notch higher to win the customers with the money from other airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are supposed to relax in lufthansa 's new first class terminal .
but will they ?
this week it unveiled a spanking new luxury terminal for first-class passengers , which resembles more a five-star hotel than a soulless functional airport . from dec .
1 , top-paying customers can sit down to a cordon-bleu dinner , choose between 50 of the world 's best whiskies at the bar , smoke a cigar in a special lounge or simply freshen up in marble bathrooms before boarding their flight . there are no crowds , no queuing and no jostling , just 1,800 square meters -lrb- 19,000 square feet -rrb- of luxury amenities at the disposal of about 350 passengers a day . lufthansa has invested about € 30 million -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- in the first-class terminal in a bid to lure premium customers away from rival airlines . executive travel " we want to create an ambiance that is like travelling in your own private jet , " said chairman wolfgang mayrhuber . " it 's a service for pop stars and for the lucky few , " who can afford to pay € 6,200 for a return ticket from frankfurt to new york or € 10,130 for a flight to tokyo , said bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul . indeed , while other carriers are scaling back their first-class services - british airways dropped its first-class on six international routes last year , swiss only offers first-class services on intercontinental flights , and iberia is pooling its first with its business class - lufthansa is hoping to consolidate its lead in the premium sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : easyjet lures with cheap flights and no frills .
analysts said that unlike low-cost or budget airlines , such as ryanair or easyjet , which bank on quantity rather than quality to keep costs down , the bigger carriers are likely to differentiate more and more between their classes in future . a question of class economy class services are likely to become more and more rudimentary , while business class services will be increasingly better equipped , said van den brul at bnp paribas . lufthansa insists that increased differentiation was the way forward , since it could persuade customers that flying can actually be a pleasurable experience again . it recently made internet access available in-flight for business clients and equipped its business class and above with seats that can be pulled out and turned into a bed on long-haul flights . british airways already installed such seats four years ago and iberia has earmarked € 100 million to equip 31 of its aircraft with similar seats . air france also plans to invest € 300 million in upgrading its upper classes on long-haul flights . virgin set a new style in the early 1990s , offering extras such as the possibility of being measured for a suit on a flight out to asia .
the garment would be available shortly after arrival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus a380 analysts now say that the campaign to use ever more luxurious and sophisticated services to lure wealthy customers was likely to receive a boost when airbus 's new superjumbo , the a380 , starts being used on commercial flights . nevertheless , five-star treatment has its limits and first-class passengers are just as likely to find their flights delayed as their lowly counterparts in economy class , even if , at least in lufthansa 's new terminal , the waiting for those lucky few could be in pampered comfort . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air passengers face higher fares german airline lufthansa and 21 other carriers will start charging passengers new service fees this autumn .

the gendarmerie police wing of the defence forces said that the tourists who disappeared on wednesday had been found on saturday about 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,100 miles -rrb- south of the coastal capital algiers .
the manager of a tourist agency in the oasis town of tamanrasset earlier told afp that a gendarmerie patrol appeared to have intercepted the germans when they were making their way to neighbouring niger while avoiding the frontier post of in guezzam .
the germans were without a guide in a part of algeria where 32 europeans were kidnapped by islamic militants last year .
on saturday , the tourism ministry had denied an earlier state radio report that they had been found .
the gendarmerie said it remained unclear why the tourists had parted company with their guide on wednesday , but they had been found camping in the desert about 300 kilometres from the border with niger .
algiers newspapers on sunday ruled out the notion that the germans had been kidnapped by armed muslim extremists , who have been waging a low-level war against the secular state since 1992 .
the press instead speculated that they wanted to be on their own to " loot archeological sites . "

the gendarmerie police wing of the defence forces said that the tourists who disappeared on wednesday had been found on saturday about 1,800 kilometers -lrb- 1,100 miles -rrb- south of the coastal capital algiers .
the manager of a tourist agency in the oasis town of tamanrasset earlier told afp that a gendarmerie patrol appeared to have intercepted the germans when they were making their way to neighbouring niger while avoiding the frontier post of in guezzam .
the germans were without a guide in a part of algeria where 32 europeans were kidnapped by islamic militants last year .
on saturday , the tourism ministry had denied an earlier state radio report that they had been found .
the gendarmerie said it remained unclear why the tourists had parted company with their guide on wednesday , but they had been found camping in the desert about 300 kilometres from the border with niger .
algiers newspapers on sunday ruled out the notion that the germans had been kidnapped by armed muslim extremists , who have been waging a low-level war against the secular state since 1992 .

trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers . chauffeurs , champagne and cigars : are these part of a high-price package which can help traditional airlines hit back at budget operators ? the german airline lufthansa thinks so . it believes that well-heeled people will pay for a chauffeur to park their cars , valets to carry suitcases , for a massage and dinner followed by a cigar in luxurious surroundings before boarding . and how about being driven by mercedes s-class or a porsche cayenne to the aircraft while the other passengers struggle against wind and rain as they cross the tarmac ? the airline industry is in trouble , crisis some say , owing to years of low profitability , setbacks in the travel industry owing to terrorism and health scares , high fuel prices and particularly the onslaught of cheap flights . some airlines , the irish company aer lingus is an example , have decided to fight the budget operators at their own game . high living at a price but lufthansa has invested heavily in the belief that the best way to counter the budget airlines is to offer high living at a high price to high spenders .
instead of going for an offer of low-cost , queue and squeeze , it has opted for the lap of luxury . the airline is counting on taking the upmarket class a notch higher to win the customers with the money from other airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are supposed to relax in lufthansa 's new first class terminal .
but will they ?
this week it unveiled a spanking new luxury terminal for first-class passengers , which resembles more a five-star hotel than a soulless functional airport . from dec .
1 , top-paying customers can sit down to a cordon-bleu dinner , choose between 50 of the world 's best whiskies at the bar , smoke a cigar in a special lounge or simply freshen up in marble bathrooms before boarding their flight . there are no crowds , no queuing and no jostling , just 1,800 square meters -lrb- 19,000 square feet -rrb- of luxury amenities at the disposal of about 350 passengers a day . lufthansa has invested about € 30 million -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- in the first-class terminal in a bid to lure premium customers away from rival airlines . executive travel " we want to create an ambiance that is like travelling in your own private jet , " said chairman wolfgang mayrhuber . " it 's a service for pop stars and for the lucky few , " who can afford to pay € 6,200 for a return ticket from frankfurt to new york or € 10,130 for a flight to tokyo , said bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul . indeed , while other carriers are scaling back their first-class services - british airways dropped its first-class on six international routes last year , swiss only offers first-class services on intercontinental flights , and iberia is pooling its first with its business class - lufthansa is hoping to consolidate its lead in the premium sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : easyjet lures with cheap flights and no frills .
analysts said that unlike low-cost or budget airlines , such as ryanair or easyjet , which bank on quantity rather than quality to keep costs down , the bigger carriers are likely to differentiate more and more between their classes in future . a question of class economy class services are likely to become more and more rudimentary , while business class services will be increasingly better equipped , said van den brul at bnp paribas . lufthansa insists that increased differentiation was the way forward , since it could persuade customers that flying can actually be a pleasurable experience again . it recently made internet access available in-flight for business clients and equipped its business class and above with seats that can be pulled out and turned into a bed on long-haul flights . british airways already installed such seats four years ago and iberia has earmarked € 100 million to equip 31 of its aircraft with similar seats . air france also plans to invest € 300 million in upgrading its upper classes on long-haul flights . virgin set a new style in the early 1990s , offering extras such as the possibility of being measured for a suit on a flight out to asia .
the garment would be available shortly after arrival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus a380 analysts now say that the campaign to use ever more luxurious and sophisticated services to lure wealthy customers was likely to receive a boost when airbus 's new superjumbo , the a380 , starts being used on commercial flights . nevertheless , five-star treatment has its limits and first-class passengers are just as likely to find their flights delayed as their lowly counterparts in economy class , even if , at least in lufthansa 's new terminal , the waiting for those lucky few could be in pampered comfort . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air passengers face higher fares german airline lufthansa and 21 other carriers will start charging passengers new service fees this autumn .

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " russia-us rivalry the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , as both seek to ensure their man wins the presidency in a country that the west sees as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma -lrb- photo , right -rrb- that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- left -rrb- talks to his ukrainian counterpart leonid kuchma the first round on october 31 was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favoured the official candidate . russia , which under president vladimir putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , meanwhile is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbour in friendly hands . a polarized country tension has risen in this country , deeply polarized by the clash between the rival visions of ukraine 's future .
the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution .

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution .

the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " russia-us rivalry the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , as both seek to ensure their man wins the presidency in a country that the west sees as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma -lrb- photo , right -rrb- that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- left -rrb- talks to his ukrainian counterpart leonid kuchma the first round on october 31 was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favoured the official candidate . russia , which under president vladimir putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , meanwhile is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbour in friendly hands . a polarized country tension has risen in this country , deeply polarized by the clash between the rival visions of ukraine 's future .
the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.11.2004 lufthansa lures with luxury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haute cuisine , anyone ?
trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers . chauffeurs , champagne and cigars : are these part of a high-price package which can help traditional airlines hit back at budget operators ? the german airline lufthansa thinks so . it believes that well-heeled people will pay for a chauffeur to park their cars , valets to carry suitcases , for a massage and dinner followed by a cigar in luxurious surroundings before boarding . and how about being driven by mercedes s-class or a porsche cayenne to the aircraft while the other passengers struggle against wind and rain as they cross the tarmac ? the airline industry is in trouble , crisis some say , owing to years of low profitability , setbacks in the travel industry owing to terrorism and health scares , high fuel prices and particularly the onslaught of cheap flights . some airlines , the irish company aer lingus is an example , have decided to fight the budget operators at their own game . high living at a price but lufthansa has invested heavily in the belief that the best way to counter the budget airlines is to offer high living at a high price to high spenders .
instead of going for an offer of low-cost , queue and squeeze , it has opted for the lap of luxury . the airline is counting on taking the upmarket class a notch higher to win the customers with the money from other airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are supposed to relax in lufthansa 's new first class terminal .
but will they ?
this week it unveiled a spanking new luxury terminal for first-class passengers , which resembles more a five-star hotel than a soulless functional airport . from dec .
1 , top-paying customers can sit down to a cordon-bleu dinner , choose between 50 of the world 's best whiskies at the bar , smoke a cigar in a special lounge or simply freshen up in marble bathrooms before boarding their flight . there are no crowds , no queuing and no jostling , just 1,800 square meters -lrb- 19,000 square feet -rrb- of luxury amenities at the disposal of about 350 passengers a day . lufthansa has invested about € 30 million -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- in the first-class terminal in a bid to lure premium customers away from rival airlines . executive travel " we want to create an ambiance that is like travelling in your own private jet , " said chairman wolfgang mayrhuber .

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution .

ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko is battling for the president 's job with prime minister viktor yanukovich , who is backed by ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma and its giant neighbour russia . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-arm rule over this eastern european country of 48 million people , vowed there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . ukraine 's opposition has close ties to the pro-western government in georgia , which came to power one year ago after peaceful demonstrations forced out the soviet-era leadership in the so-called " rose revolution . " yushchenko vows to protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich yushchenko has vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets if kuchma 's appointed heir , yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , is declared the winner fraudulently in sunday 's election , warning of large-scale vote-rigging . a police officer was reported killed at a polling station in central ukraine early in the day , underscoring the tense atmosphere surrounding the knife-edge poll . in cold but sunny weather , voting took place under tight security at 33,000 polling stations across the country , with exit polls due to be published right after the close of voting at 8 p.m. local time , and official results expected early monday . an armed detachment of police equipped with armoured personnel carriers guarded the offices of the central electoral commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was optimistic as he voted in kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen .
we have a new electorate , a new country , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " russia-us rivalry the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , as both seek to ensure their man wins the presidency in a country that the west sees as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma -lrb- photo , right -rrb- that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- left -rrb- talks to his ukrainian counterpart leonid kuchma the first round on october 31 was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favoured the official candidate . russia , which under president vladimir putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , meanwhile is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbour in friendly hands . a polarized country tension has risen in this country , deeply polarized by the clash between the rival visions of ukraine 's future .
the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers . chauffeurs , champagne and cigars : are these part of a high-price package which can help traditional airlines hit back at budget operators ? the german airline lufthansa thinks so . it believes that well-heeled people will pay for a chauffeur to park their cars , valets to carry suitcases , for a massage and dinner followed by a cigar in luxurious surroundings before boarding . and how about being driven by mercedes s-class or a porsche cayenne to the aircraft while the other passengers struggle against wind and rain as they cross the tarmac ? the airline industry is in trouble , crisis some say , owing to years of low profitability , setbacks in the travel industry owing to terrorism and health scares , high fuel prices and particularly the onslaught of cheap flights . some airlines , the irish company aer lingus is an example , have decided to fight the budget operators at their own game . high living at a price but lufthansa has invested heavily in the belief that the best way to counter the budget airlines is to offer high living at a high price to high spenders .
instead of going for an offer of low-cost , queue and squeeze , it has opted for the lap of luxury . the airline is counting on taking the upmarket class a notch higher to win the customers with the money from other airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are supposed to relax in lufthansa 's new first class terminal .
but will they ?
this week it unveiled a spanking new luxury terminal for first-class passengers , which resembles more a five-star hotel than a soulless functional airport . from dec .
1 , top-paying customers can sit down to a cordon-bleu dinner , choose between 50 of the world 's best whiskies at the bar , smoke a cigar in a special lounge or simply freshen up in marble bathrooms before boarding their flight . there are no crowds , no queuing and no jostling , just 1,800 square meters -lrb- 19,000 square feet -rrb- of luxury amenities at the disposal of about 350 passengers a day . lufthansa has invested about € 30 million -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- in the first-class terminal in a bid to lure premium customers away from rival airlines . executive travel " we want to create an ambiance that is like travelling in your own private jet , " said chairman wolfgang mayrhuber . " it 's a service for pop stars and for the lucky few , " who can afford to pay € 6,200 for a return ticket from frankfurt to new york or € 10,130 for a flight to tokyo , said bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul . indeed , while other carriers are scaling back their first-class services - british airways dropped its first-class on six international routes last year , swiss only offers first-class services on intercontinental flights , and iberia is pooling its first with its business class - lufthansa is hoping to consolidate its lead in the premium sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : easyjet lures with cheap flights and no frills .
analysts said that unlike low-cost or budget airlines , such as ryanair or easyjet , which bank on quantity rather than quality to keep costs down , the bigger carriers are likely to differentiate more and more between their classes in future . a question of class economy class services are likely to become more and more rudimentary , while business class services will be increasingly better equipped , said van den brul at bnp paribas . lufthansa insists that increased differentiation was the way forward , since it could persuade customers that flying can actually be a pleasurable experience again . it recently made internet access available in-flight for business clients and equipped its business class and above with seats that can be pulled out and turned into a bed on long-haul flights . british airways already installed such seats four years ago and iberia has earmarked € 100 million to equip 31 of its aircraft with similar seats . air france also plans to invest € 300 million in upgrading its upper classes on long-haul flights . virgin set a new style in the early 1990s , offering extras such as the possibility of being measured for a suit on a flight out to asia .
the garment would be available shortly after arrival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus a380 analysts now say that the campaign to use ever more luxurious and sophisticated services to lure wealthy customers was likely to receive a boost when airbus 's new superjumbo , the a380 , starts being used on commercial flights . nevertheless , five-star treatment has its limits and first-class passengers are just as likely to find their flights delayed as their lowly counterparts in economy class , even if , at least in lufthansa 's new terminal , the waiting for those lucky few could be in pampered comfort . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air passengers face higher fares german airline lufthansa and 21 other carriers will start charging passengers new service fees this autumn .

the two opponents both garnered around 40 percent of the vote in the first round . yushchenko , 50 , a former reformist prime minister , is hugely popular in the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west , while the 54-year-old yanukovich draws his support from the heavily industrialized russian-speaking east . yanukovich , who has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship , supports the formation of an economic union with russia and two other major ex-soviet states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rallied in support of viktor yushchenko in october yushchenko says he sees ukraine 's future in europe and has set the goal of starting membership talks for the european union and possibly even the brussels-based nato military alliance within three to five years . some 37 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which is being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . the turnout was 20 percent by 11 a.m. , slightly less than at the same hour in the first round , in which 75 percent of voters participated , but electoral officials predicted a surge in voting later in the day . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ?

george w bush told the asia-pacific summit in chile that the message to pyongyang was clear : " get rid of your nuclear weapons programmes . "
north korea said it would beef up its deterrent defences , official media in pyongyang reported on sunday .
the apec summit meeting is being held under tight security in santiago .
on friday , tens of thousands of people protested on the city streets against capitalism and the iraq war .
at least 189 people were detained .
police have been deployed in strength throughout santiago to break up unofficial protests .
trade liberalisation and counter-terrorism are high on the agenda of the first official summit involving the leaders of all 21 member states , which include canada , china , japan , russia and the us .
deadlock american officials say mr bush is using the apec summit to map a strategy to resume talks with pyongyang over its nuclear ambitions .
he had separate meetings with the chinese , japanese , russian and south korean leaders before the summit opened .
they , together with the us and north korea , represent the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks on pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions .
the message is clear to mr kim jong-il : get rid of your nuclear weapons programmes george w bush " five apec members are working to convince north korea to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons , " mr bush told the conference .
" i can report to you today , having visited with the other nations involved in that collaborative effort that the will is strong , that the effort is united , and the message is clear to mr kim jong-il -lsb- north korean leader -rsb- ; get rid of your nuclear weapons programmes . "
a day after mr bush 's message , a commentary in rodong sinmun , the official paper of the ruling workers ' party , said north korea needed to bolster its defences " as long as the us persists in its attempt to stifle the dprk -lsb- north korea -rsb- with nuclear weapons " .
it said the us has " worked out a nuclear war scenario against the dprk in top secrecy and has regularly staged drills for dropping nuclear bombs " .
north korea failed to attend the latest round of six-party talks in september aimed at resolving the deadlock over its nuclear programme .

before his speech , the us leader also had words of warning for iran , following reports it has accelerated production of uranium material that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
" it 's very important for the iranian government to hear that we are concerned about their desires and we 're concerned about reports that show that prior to a certain international meeting , they 're willing to speed up processing of materials that could lead to a nuclear weapon , " mr bush was quoted as saying by the afp news agency .
the apec summit is the first big international gathering that mr bush has attended since his re-election .
members of the bloc , set up in 1989 mainly to promote trade among pacific rim states , now account for more than half of global economic output and almost half of all international trade .
the bbc 's elliott gotkine in santiago says there are hopes that apec could take steps towards creating a free trade area for the asia-pacific region .

they , together with the us and north korea , represent the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks on pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions .
the message is clear to mr kim jong-il : get rid of your nuclear weapons programmes george w bush " five apec members are working to convince north korea to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons , " mr bush told the conference .
" i can report to you today , having visited with the other nations involved in that collaborative effort that the will is strong , that the effort is united , and the message is clear to mr kim jong-il -lsb- north korean leader -rsb- ; get rid of your nuclear weapons programmes . "
a day after mr bush 's message , a commentary in rodong sinmun , the official paper of the ruling workers ' party , said north korea needed to bolster its defences " as long as the us persists in its attempt to stifle the dprk -lsb- north korea -rsb- with nuclear weapons " .
it said the us has " worked out a nuclear war scenario against the dprk in top secrecy and has regularly staged drills for dropping nuclear bombs " .
north korea failed to attend the latest round of six-party talks in september aimed at resolving the deadlock over its nuclear programme .
evolving apec 1989 : set up to promote free trade 1993 : bill clinton proclaims ' pacific century ' 1997 : confidence hit by asian financial crisis 1999 : east timor crisis profile : apec spotlight on chile 's leader many detained in protests us negotiators have denied reports that some of the countries want more concessions for north korea , beyond a proposal made in june to allow south korea and japan to supply it with aid .
before his speech , the us leader also had words of warning for iran , following reports it has accelerated production of uranium material that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
" it 's very important for the iranian government to hear that we are concerned about their desires and we 're concerned about reports that show that prior to a certain international meeting , they 're willing to speed up processing of materials that could lead to a nuclear weapon , " mr bush was quoted as saying by the afp news agency .
the apec summit is the first big international gathering that mr bush has attended since his re-election .
members of the bloc , set up in 1989 mainly to promote trade among pacific rim states , now account for more than half of global economic output and almost half of all international trade .
the bbc 's elliott gotkine in santiago says there are hopes that apec could take steps towards creating a free trade area for the asia-pacific region .

the 19-storey churchill house office block came down in seconds on sunday to make way for a £ 300m retail and leisure complex .
destruction of the building , which went up in the 1960s , had caused a few problems for the yorkshire-based company carrying out the demolition .
senior explosives expert dick green said that originally the building was just one metre from its neighbour .
mr green , from the controlled demolition group , said : " even with all our technical expertise , it is very difficult to drop 10,000 tonnes of rubble without some of it going backwards . "
his company has demolished bigger buildings , but few have been taken down in such a tight space .
mr green said : " there is about 90kg of explosives positioned throughout the building , which may sound a lot , but it is spread between 2,500 individual charges , so each charge is very small .
" when we first came on site , the building was situated about one metre from the next building .
we have extended that gap to about 10 metres by taking some of the building down . "
many parents brought their children along to the event .
the 19-storey churchill house was in a tight city centre site churchill house fell to the ground shortly after 1000 gmt on sunday .
the operation to remove hundreds of tonnes of rubble from the site began immediately after the demolition .
the engineers said they threw the building away from the ones they were trying to protect .
this was done by delaying the charges from one end to the other .
at one end they started with instantaneous charges and over two seconds delayed it through the building so it pulled the intended way .
the building , which has housed bt and government departments , was demolished to make way for the new victoria square shopping centre , due to open in 2007 .
large sections of the city centre were sealed off for the demolition .
as the building came down , technical project manager jon munce said : " we followed strict regulations when preparing for this historic day with the surrounding city centre area closed off to the public for a number of hours this morning . "
hundreds of people turned up to see the demolition paul sargent , managing director of am developments -rrb- said : " today 's implosion symbolises a new beginning in belfast .
victoria square will be a flagship project , which will promote a new image of belfast as a thriving , high-quality retailing centre . "
social development minister john spellar , who was not present for the demolition , said the new development would revitalise the heart of the centre .
" our vision is to strengthen belfast as a premier regional shopping destination providing a high quality safe urban environment , attractive to investors , employees , residents and visitors , " he said .
after the demolition , dozens of balloons were released into the air to celebrate the event .

the board fears it could become part of the welsh assembly government in a shake-up to be revealed this month , and worries that this will affect its work .
the warning is in a letter seen by bbc wales ' maniffesto programme .
other quangos , including the wales tourist board , have been told that they are to be part of his government .
in july this year , the first minister said that most welsh quangos will be abolished within two years .
quangos - which stands for quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - are semi-independent agencies of the assembly government .
they operate as arm 's-length executive bodies responsible to boards appointed by ministers .
mr morgan said an announcement would be made this autumn on which organisations would come under the control of the assembly government .
he has already said the welsh development agency , the wales tourist board and the post-16 education body , elwa , will cease to be by 2006 .
however , welsh language board members have written to mr morgan warning that any change to their organisation could damage the welsh language .
the letter sent in late september in the name of board chair , meri huws , warns mr morgan that if he was to make the board part of the welsh assembly government , it would be " irregular , untidy and give rise to conflicts of interest " .
this , ms huws argues in that letter that is because of the difficulties the welsh assembly government would have monitoring its own welsh language schemes .
currently , the board does this .
the second objection , according to the board 's chair , is the effect changing its status would have upon its current ability to make arm 's-length decisions from the assembly government .
in the letter , ms huws warns that there is a danger " that incorporating the board 's duties within the government would make the language less visible , giving the impression perhaps that the government is cutting back on its support for the language " .
' political mischief-making the board also warn that there are " political advantages for the government in having an arm 's length body taking specific decisions within a strategic remit established by the government directly " .
ms huws adds in the letter , " it is certainly the case that decisions which are taken by specialist , impartial bodies are less likely to be the subject of political mischief-making than those taken by the government directly " .
no one from the welsh language board was prepared to be interviewed about the content of the letter .
the welsh assembly government said : " the welsh assembly government asked the welsh language board to respond to our considerations and we are grateful for their response , which is now under review . "

the board fears it could become part of the welsh assembly government in a shake-up to be revealed this month , and worries that this will affect its work .
the warning is in a letter seen by bbc wales ' maniffesto programme .
other quangos , including the wales tourist board , have been told that they are to be part of his government .
in july this year , the first minister said that most welsh quangos will be abolished within two years .
quangos - which stands for quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - are semi-independent agencies of the assembly government .
they operate as arm 's-length executive bodies responsible to boards appointed by ministers .
mr morgan said an announcement would be made this autumn on which organisations would come under the control of the assembly government .
he has already said the welsh development agency , the wales tourist board and the post-16 education body , elwa , will cease to be by 2006 .
the board 's letter was written in the name of its chair , meri huws however , welsh language board members have written to mr morgan warning that any change to their organisation could damage the welsh language .
the letter sent in late september in the name of board chair , meri huws , warns mr morgan that if he was to make the board part of the welsh assembly government , it would be " irregular , untidy and give rise to conflicts of interest " .
this , ms huws argues in that letter that is because of the difficulties the welsh assembly government would have monitoring its own welsh language schemes .
currently , the board does this .
the second objection , according to the board 's chair , is the effect changing its status would have upon its current ability to make arm 's-length decisions from the assembly government .
in the letter , ms huws warns that there is a danger " that incorporating the board 's duties within the government would make the language less visible , giving the impression perhaps that the government is cutting back on its support for the language " .
' political mischief-making the board also warn that there are " political advantages for the government in having an arm 's length body taking specific decisions within a strategic remit established by the government directly " .
ms huws adds in the letter , " it is certainly the case that decisions which are taken by specialist , impartial bodies are less likely to be the subject of political mischief-making than those taken by the government directly " .
