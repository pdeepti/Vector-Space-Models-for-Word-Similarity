on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . on may 16 , 1944 , about 6,000 sinti and roma in auschwitz had resisted orders to get on trucks that would take them to the gas chambers .
armed with improvised weapons made out of tools , they hid in their barracks and eventually managed to get ss officers to abandon the transport . about 3,000 of those participating in the revolt were later sent to other concentration camps where some of them survived .
the others , mainly women , children and older people , were murdered .
altogether , the nazis deported about 23,000 sinti and roma from eleven european countries to auschwitz . sixty years later , sunday 's ceremony at the german foreign ministry in berlin for the first time did n't just focus on the extermination of sinti and roma under the nazis , but also highlighted the desperate courage camp inmates displayed in resisting their murderers , said romani rose , the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma . calls to speed up erection of memorial rose added that the german government should act swiftly and build a proposed memorial for sinti and roma holocaust victims near the parliament building and the brandenburg gate . it will be situated near the memorial currently under construction for jewish holocaust victims as well as a third memorial that will be erected to honor homosexuals who perished under the nazis . " we 're calling on you to no longer delay the erection of the memorial , " rose told the audience that also included german foreign minister joschka fischer . rau responded by strongly criticizing any attempts to suppress , deny or play down the genocide of sinti and roma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rau during a speech in the german parliament " you stood up against barbarianism in germany 's darkest hour and thereby held on to the inviolability of human dignity , " rau -lrb- photo -rrb- said , addressing auschwitz survivors in the audience .
" for that , you deserve our respect and that 's why your courageous behavior should be much better known than it is today . " referring to the continuing discrimination many of europe 's 8.5 million sinti and roma still face today , rau said everything should be done to prevent this . " if the inconceivable is not to happen again , we have to make sure in our daily lives that people from different backgrounds , different religions and different cultural traditions live together with esteem and respect , " rau said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .
" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .

it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .
-lrb- may 11 , 2004 -rrb- german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2004 rice comes to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq and the middle east will dominate rice 's talks in germany .
u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .
-lrb- may 11 , 2004 -rrb- german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism .

on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . on may 16 , 1944 , about 6,000 sinti and roma in auschwitz had resisted orders to get on trucks that would take them to the gas chambers .
armed with improvised weapons made out of tools , they hid in their barracks and eventually managed to get ss officers to abandon the transport . about 3,000 of those participating in the revolt were later sent to other concentration camps where some of them survived .
the others , mainly women , children and older people , were murdered .
altogether , the nazis deported about 23,000 sinti and roma from eleven european countries to auschwitz . sixty years later , sunday 's ceremony at the german foreign ministry in berlin for the first time did n't just focus on the extermination of sinti and roma under the nazis , but also highlighted the desperate courage camp inmates displayed in resisting their murderers , said romani rose , the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma . calls to speed up erection of memorial rose added that the german government should act swiftly and build a proposed memorial for sinti and roma holocaust victims near the parliament building and the brandenburg gate . it will be situated near the memorial currently under construction for jewish holocaust victims as well as a third memorial that will be erected to honor homosexuals who perished under the nazis . " we 're calling on you to no longer delay the erection of the memorial , " rose told the audience that also included german foreign minister joschka fischer . rau responded by strongly criticizing any attempts to suppress , deny or play down the genocide of sinti and roma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rau during a speech in the german parliament " you stood up against barbarianism in germany 's darkest hour and thereby held on to the inviolability of human dignity , " rau -lrb- photo -rrb- said , addressing auschwitz survivors in the audience .
" for that , you deserve our respect and that 's why your courageous behavior should be much better known than it is today . " referring to the continuing discrimination many of europe 's 8.5 million sinti and roma still face today , rau said everything should be done to prevent this . " if the inconceivable is not to happen again , we have to make sure in our daily lives that people from different backgrounds , different religions and different cultural traditions live together with esteem and respect , " rau said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .
" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june . both sides said they hope to reach an agreement at the next meeting , reuters news agency reported .
" we 've made rapid progress in these last four rounds of talks and this gives us justified hope that we can reach full agreement in a fifth round in june , " german lawyer hans-joachim ehrig said after three days of talks in the german capital that also involved officials from germany 's foreign ministry . but ehrig added that there was still a " significant gap " over how much money the more than 160 people wounded in the attack should receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco after the attack on april 5 , 1986 .
the bomb at west berlin 's " la belle " disco killed two u.s. soldiers and a turkish woman .
the libyan secret service allegedly plotted the attack .
in 2001 , a german court convicted four people , including a former libyan diplomat , for their involvement in the attacks . while representatives for the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi offered to pay $ 325,000 -lrb- € 275,000 -rrb- to each of the 11 people most seriously injured in the attack , the german lawyers are seeking $ 600,000 .
the libyans are also offering $ 125,000 to each of the other victims , compared to the $ 400,000 demanded by the germans . an agreement is important for libya since the country 's admission to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries hinges on it .
participation in the program would help libya in its attempts to rejoin the international community , lift trade restrictions and bring financial aid to the north african state . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .

" these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2004 rice comes to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq and the middle east will dominate rice 's talks in germany .
u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .
-lrb- may 11 , 2004 -rrb- german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism .

washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security .

nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2004 rice comes to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq and the middle east will dominate rice 's talks in germany .
u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .

washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .

nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous .

" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2004 rice comes to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq and the middle east will dominate rice 's talks in germany .
u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .
-lrb- may 11 , 2004 -rrb- german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .

on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . on may 16 , 1944 , about 6,000 sinti and roma in auschwitz had resisted orders to get on trucks that would take them to the gas chambers .
armed with improvised weapons made out of tools , they hid in their barracks and eventually managed to get ss officers to abandon the transport . about 3,000 of those participating in the revolt were later sent to other concentration camps where some of them survived .
the others , mainly women , children and older people , were murdered .
altogether , the nazis deported about 23,000 sinti and roma from eleven european countries to auschwitz . sixty years later , sunday 's ceremony at the german foreign ministry in berlin for the first time did n't just focus on the extermination of sinti and roma under the nazis , but also highlighted the desperate courage camp inmates displayed in resisting their murderers , said romani rose , the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma . calls to speed up erection of memorial rose added that the german government should act swiftly and build a proposed memorial for sinti and roma holocaust victims near the parliament building and the brandenburg gate . it will be situated near the memorial currently under construction for jewish holocaust victims as well as a third memorial that will be erected to honor homosexuals who perished under the nazis . " we 're calling on you to no longer delay the erection of the memorial , " rose told the audience that also included german foreign minister joschka fischer . rau responded by strongly criticizing any attempts to suppress , deny or play down the genocide of sinti and roma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rau during a speech in the german parliament " you stood up against barbarianism in germany 's darkest hour and thereby held on to the inviolability of human dignity , " rau -lrb- photo -rrb- said , addressing auschwitz survivors in the audience .
" for that , you deserve our respect and that 's why your courageous behavior should be much better known than it is today . " referring to the continuing discrimination many of europe 's 8.5 million sinti and roma still face today , rau said everything should be done to prevent this . " if the inconceivable is not to happen again , we have to make sure in our daily lives that people from different backgrounds , different religions and different cultural traditions live together with esteem and respect , " rau said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2004 rice comes to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq and the middle east will dominate rice 's talks in germany .
u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .
-lrb- may 11 , 2004 -rrb- german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june . both sides said they hope to reach an agreement at the next meeting , reuters news agency reported .
" we 've made rapid progress in these last four rounds of talks and this gives us justified hope that we can reach full agreement in a fifth round in june , " german lawyer hans-joachim ehrig said after three days of talks in the german capital that also involved officials from germany 's foreign ministry . but ehrig added that there was still a " significant gap " over how much money the more than 160 people wounded in the attack should receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco after the attack on april 5 , 1986 .
the bomb at west berlin 's " la belle " disco killed two u.s. soldiers and a turkish woman .
the libyan secret service allegedly plotted the attack .
in 2001 , a german court convicted four people , including a former libyan diplomat , for their involvement in the attacks . while representatives for the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi offered to pay $ 325,000 -lrb- € 275,000 -rrb- to each of the 11 people most seriously injured in the attack , the german lawyers are seeking $ 600,000 .
the libyans are also offering $ 125,000 to each of the other victims , compared to the $ 400,000 demanded by the germans . an agreement is important for libya since the country 's admission to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries hinges on it .
participation in the program would help libya in its attempts to rejoin the international community , lift trade restrictions and bring financial aid to the north african state . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .
" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .
-lrb- may 11 , 2004 -rrb- german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .
" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .

it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .
but later on , bush sent a letter of reassurance to the palestinian prime minister qureia -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .
it was therefore logical that the two topics should be addressed together during monday ’ s talks . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .
" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june . both sides said they hope to reach an agreement at the next meeting , reuters news agency reported .
" we 've made rapid progress in these last four rounds of talks and this gives us justified hope that we can reach full agreement in a fifth round in june , " german lawyer hans-joachim ehrig said after three days of talks in the german capital that also involved officials from germany 's foreign ministry . but ehrig added that there was still a " significant gap " over how much money the more than 160 people wounded in the attack should receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's la belle disco after the attack on april 5 , 1986 .
the bomb at west berlin 's " la belle " disco killed two u.s. soldiers and a turkish woman .
the libyan secret service allegedly plotted the attack .
in 2001 , a german court convicted four people , including a former libyan diplomat , for their involvement in the attacks . while representatives for the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi offered to pay $ 325,000 -lrb- € 275,000 -rrb- to each of the 11 people most seriously injured in the attack , the german lawyers are seeking $ 600,000 .
the libyans are also offering $ 125,000 to each of the other victims , compared to the $ 400,000 demanded by the germans . an agreement is important for libya since the country 's admission to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries hinges on it .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .

" these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous .

a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board . trying to placate opponents of a car toll , german transport minister manfred stolpe on sunday said that the government had no plans to privatize the country 's entire highway system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i 'm very cautious with this because that would mean that everyone would have to pay , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said according to news reports .
but he added that he intended to push for a car toll on certain highway sections such as bridges and tunnels that are built with private money . stolpe is in dire need to use his funds wisely as delays in introducing a truck-toll system have already left a huge hole in the budget . " these additional funds are needed , " the social democrat said , referring to a possible car toll .
" next year is going to be bad and 2006 will be even worse . " while some , such as greens parliamentarian antje hermenau , praised the suggestion and said the government should privatize the entire highway system to fill the budget hole , others said the idea was ludicrous . " i think nothing of it , " said albert schmidt , a transport expert for the greens party , which is the junior government coalition partner .
" we do n't even have the truck toll yet . " car manufacturers worry about business opposition politicians also criticized the proposal as " poison for the country . " " it 's an audacity that citizens should pay for the truck toll disaster , " said markus söder , the secretary general of bavaria 's christian social union . officials for germany 's largest automobile club , the adac , said they were glad to hear that stolpe did n't plan to introduce a car toll throughout the country . but bernd gottschalk , the president of the association of the german automotive industry , said a car toll could harm manufacturers even more as people were already dealing with sky-rocketing gas prices . talk about further charges for car owners should stop immediately to make sure that germany 's ailing car industry is n't damaged any further , gottschalk said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de states demand funding despite truck toll debacle transport ministers from germany 's states called on the federal government to vouch for roadwork they fear may not be fully financed .

on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . on may 16 , 1944 , about 6,000 sinti and roma in auschwitz had resisted orders to get on trucks that would take them to the gas chambers .
armed with improvised weapons made out of tools , they hid in their barracks and eventually managed to get ss officers to abandon the transport . about 3,000 of those participating in the revolt were later sent to other concentration camps where some of them survived .
the others , mainly women , children and older people , were murdered .
altogether , the nazis deported about 23,000 sinti and roma from eleven european countries to auschwitz . sixty years later , sunday 's ceremony at the german foreign ministry in berlin for the first time did n't just focus on the extermination of sinti and roma under the nazis , but also highlighted the desperate courage camp inmates displayed in resisting their murderers , said romani rose , the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma . calls to speed up erection of memorial rose added that the german government should act swiftly and build a proposed memorial for sinti and roma holocaust victims near the parliament building and the brandenburg gate . it will be situated near the memorial currently under construction for jewish holocaust victims as well as a third memorial that will be erected to honor homosexuals who perished under the nazis . " we 're calling on you to no longer delay the erection of the memorial , " rose told the audience that also included german foreign minister joschka fischer . rau responded by strongly criticizing any attempts to suppress , deny or play down the genocide of sinti and roma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rau during a speech in the german parliament " you stood up against barbarianism in germany 's darkest hour and thereby held on to the inviolability of human dignity , " rau -lrb- photo -rrb- said , addressing auschwitz survivors in the audience .
" for that , you deserve our respect and that 's why your courageous behavior should be much better known than it is today . " referring to the continuing discrimination many of europe 's 8.5 million sinti and roma still face today , rau said everything should be done to prevent this .

on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . on may 16 , 1944 , about 6,000 sinti and roma in auschwitz had resisted orders to get on trucks that would take them to the gas chambers .
armed with improvised weapons made out of tools , they hid in their barracks and eventually managed to get ss officers to abandon the transport . about 3,000 of those participating in the revolt were later sent to other concentration camps where some of them survived .
the others , mainly women , children and older people , were murdered .
altogether , the nazis deported about 23,000 sinti and roma from eleven european countries to auschwitz . sixty years later , sunday 's ceremony at the german foreign ministry in berlin for the first time did n't just focus on the extermination of sinti and roma under the nazis , but also highlighted the desperate courage camp inmates displayed in resisting their murderers , said romani rose , the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma . calls to speed up erection of memorial rose added that the german government should act swiftly and build a proposed memorial for sinti and roma holocaust victims near the parliament building and the brandenburg gate . it will be situated near the memorial currently under construction for jewish holocaust victims as well as a third memorial that will be erected to honor homosexuals who perished under the nazis . " we 're calling on you to no longer delay the erection of the memorial , " rose told the audience that also included german foreign minister joschka fischer . rau responded by strongly criticizing any attempts to suppress , deny or play down the genocide of sinti and roma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rau during a speech in the german parliament " you stood up against barbarianism in germany 's darkest hour and thereby held on to the inviolability of human dignity , " rau -lrb- photo -rrb- said , addressing auschwitz survivors in the audience .
" for that , you deserve our respect and that 's why your courageous behavior should be much better known than it is today . " referring to the continuing discrimination many of europe 's 8.5 million sinti and roma still face today , rau said everything should be done to prevent this .

u.s. national security adviser condoleeza rice is to due to visit berlin on sunday and monday , following a round of talks with russian president vladimir putin in moscow . at the center of talks in germany will be plans to transfer power to the iraqi people in june as well as ways of revitalizing the middle east peace process .
while in berlin , rice is expected to meet with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . with her visits to moscow and berlin , rice is travelling to two countries which were among the staunchest opponents of the war in iraq .
but there ’ s agreement that despite earlier discrepancies , all efforts must now be geared towards making iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction a success despite the political blunders committed by u.s. forces on the ground . iraqi handover central to discussions on monday , rice is expected to debate with german leaders the modalities of the planned handover of power to the iraqi people .
washington is hoping to craft a new un resolution which would set the stage from the transition to self-rule in june .
given the current security problems in iraq , the u.s. administration might be forced to grant the united nations a larger role in the country , said the director of the berlin-based institute for transatlantic security , otfried nassauer . " condoleezza rice is probably trying to convince the german government to take a more positive stand on the u.s. approach , which would leave quite a lot of control with the u.s. forces currently deployed in iraq , " he said .
" however , the german government is much more likely to insist on the un and the future iraqi government to get decision making rights , especially in the areas of economic , politics and in some ways also security . " in her talks with german leaders , rice will also focus on ways of bringing the middle east peace plan back on track .
u.s. president george w. bush angered the arab world and europeans last month by embracing sharon 's plan for a unilateral withdrawal from gaza and parts of the west bank , which many feared would sideline a middle east “ roadmap ” peace plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed qureia bush further irked arab leaders by affirming israel ’ s right to retain parts of the west bank while denying palestinian refugees the right of return to lands inside israel .

it reiterated washington 's commitment to a two-state solution and the need to implement the international middle east roadmap peace blueprint launched jointly by the united states , russia , the united nations and the european union . a sign of progress ? on monday , rice is scheduled to hold talks with qureia in berlin - a meeting reported to have been brokered by german foreign minister joschka fischer during his visit to washington earlier this week .
nassauer viewed the forthcoming meeting as at least a symbolic gesture pointing to the bush administration ’ s willingness to take a more balanced stance on the middle east conflict . " compared to the position of earlier u.s. governments , the u.s. government currently running the administration is much more one-sided , " he said .
" this government has to take a more balanced stand for which this meeting could be an initial sign , however , as far as we can predict , it will again be a problem whether the u.s. government will show the flexibility to correct positions it has taken earlier . " ahead of rice ’ s visit , fischer said the iraq issue and the middle east conflict were inseparably linked .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- wall of silence over terror threat bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home sunday , 16 may , 2004 , 04:59 gmt 05:59 uk wall of silence over terror threat by susan o 'keeffe producer , panorama 's london under attack terrorists target london with multiple attacks .
it 's a nightmare scenario devised by panorama with the help of security experts to test how well britain would cope .
but the government condemned the exercise as " irresponsible " and refused to co-operate .
taking morning coffee to discuss terrorism with the mandarins of government is , i accept , a rather unusual entry in anyone 's diary .
on a cold day before last christmas , we assembled in a small dark room in whitehall .
no paintings on the walls , no windows to gaze through but compensation courtesy of an abundance of chocolate biscuits on a china plate ; panorama on one side , the normally faceless bureaucrats on the other .
we had contacted the cabinet office and the home office and explained that we were producing a rather unusual panorama , designed to assess the state of preparedness for a terrorist attack .
willing to help " it will only be a matter of time before a crude version of a chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear attack is launched at a major western city " eliza manningham-buller head of mi5 , june 2003 we said that the programme would be built around a fictional scenario and we asked to come and meet them to talk about it .
the cabinet office hosted an on-the-record meeting and the home office sent its representative .
on the face of it the cabinet office seemed willing to help - provided we agreed to organise our terrorist attack in a way that was acceptable to them .
this means car bombs are top of the list , with hostage or hijack coming in second .
we said we did not believe car bombs , hijacks or hostages reflected accurately the terrorist threat prevailing in the uk .
not because we wanted to be difficult but because all our research suggested these were remnants of a bygone era of terrorism .
they were also events the emergency services had good experience of , would deal with admirably and would be unlikely to warrant major incident plans being put in place .
co-operation refused we said that a fictional terrorist attack warranted " thinking out of the box " and that it would be a good thing to examine the civil contingency efforts of government since the shocking events of 9/11 .
our scenario centred on a series of suicide bombs on the london underground followed by a chlorine tanker exploding in the east end of london .
however , they said they were unlikely to help us if we insisted on this " irresponsible " scenario .
they said it would give ideas to the terrorists because terrorists watch television .
but they said they would need to talk to their bosses - the politicians - to gauge their view but that it was unlikely their view would be markedly different .
nothing irresponsible we tried to assure them that , as the bbc 's flagship current affairs programme , we were far from irresponsible and took the matter very seriously indeed .
they would not be moved .
we agreed to go away and review our scenario in light of their reservations and we left .
to strengthen our case , we prepared a meticulous document which outlined the reasons why we had elected to pursue this particular scenario .
we got in touch with the cabinet office and arranged a second meeting where we hoped we could raise some of our research with them to show that there was nothing irresponsible about our actions .
on the morning of the meeting , i received a phone call from the cabinet office to say that , given that we were refusing to move from our proposed scenario , there was no purpose to the meeting .
i demurred and said the research was valuable and deserved proper debate .
they were not persuaded .
the new year dawned and we continued our research .
although we never had a second meeting and we had no further contact of any note , we were constantly aware of the presence of the cabinet office .
wall of silence " the less discreet officials in these organisations revealed that their lack of participation was not their decision but resulted from an e-mail sent by " senior government officials " " it was fairly straightforward , really .
we would call the press office of any one of the myriad organisations officially involved with civil contingencies .
as soon as we identified ourselves , the conversation came to a close .
the manner of termination varied from the polite promise to call back , referral to a colleague who would decline to comment and finally the downright rude .
one or two of the less discreet officials in these organisations revealed that their lack of participation was not their decision but resulted from an e-mail sent by " senior government officials " .
they were thorough .
no matter where we turned for advice or information , our way was barred .
support withdrawn at the same time , a number of people we had asked to take part in the programme pulled out .
our original plan to create a realistic cobra-style -lrb- emergency cabinet -rrb- meeting to respond to the fictional scenario fell by the wayside .
they withdrew their support , some in a vague fashion , others more honestly .
again the word ' irresponsible ' occurred .
again those " senior government officials " were mentioned .
we did of course continue to test out our so-called ' irresponsible ' scenario with experts , former police officers , former intelligence officers , politicians , emergency planning officers and terrorism experts both here and in the us .
no-one else used the word ' irresponsible ' .
chemical threat a number told us that an exploding chemical tanker had been discussed within government and that it would be a real test of our ability to cope .
everybody took what we were saying very seriously and agreed that it was a worthwhile project .
several officials , banned from talking to us , were keen to assess for themselves how ' irresponsible ' we really were .
unofficially they asked us straight out what scenario we had created .
when we explained , they were astounded we had been dubbed ' irresponsible . '
as people in the front line of emergency planning and organisation , they believed it was plausible .
as a consequence , some of them ignored the ban and helped .
naturally the lack of official co-operation made our research more complicated but it failed to stop us .
enough people officially and unofficially wanted to help .
they talked to us , shared concerns , showed us documents and told us where the gaps are .
in early march , we went back to the home office with a list of questions , based on the home secretary 's update on civil contingency issues .
request declined our questions were not answered .
we said they were legitimate journalistic questions based on a document in the public domain .
we were told that since the programme was ' irresponsible ' there would be no answers .
as the dates for final filming drew closer , several more people withdrew from the programme , feeling " under pressure " .
unbidden , the cabinet office did call to try to find out who was taking part in the programme and if the scenario had changed .
although there was still no government co-operation , we decided to submit an early request for an interview with the home secretary .
we wanted the home secretary to be able to respond to issues raised by the programme .
the home office replied by saying that the request would be put to mr blunkett if a number of conditions could be satisfied .
warnings " never has the public been more entitled to know what might happen if we are attacked " these included having a full list of participants , having a rough cut of the programme plus a guarantee that nobody else would be interviewed after the home secretary .
we pointed out that these are not procedures normally adopted by programme makers at the bbc .
our request for an interview was declined by the home secretary " on behalf of the government " .
in the end panorama has produced a programme which uses a different format to address a subject which we know is in the minds of many .
during the time of production , there have been many documents and reports produced relating to terrorism .
terrorist suspects have been arrested across england , senior officials have continued to warn about a potential attack and other countries have suffered at the hands of terrorists .
life and death ?
sadly , a terrorist attack in the uk and notably in london , remains a strong possibility .
we did not set out to do battle with this government .
our aim was to engage with them and the many others involved in preparing for a terrorist attack to show the strengths and weaknesses of emergency planning .
never has the public been more entitled to know what might happen if we are attacked .
in programme making , we sometimes fool ourselves that important stories are matters of life and death .
this time , it 's true .
simply wanting to tell that story can not be " irresponsible " .

it 's a nightmare scenario devised by panorama with the help of security experts to test how well britain would cope .
but the government condemned the exercise as " irresponsible " and refused to co-operate .

on a cold day before last christmas , we assembled in a small dark room in whitehall .
no paintings on the walls , no windows to gaze through but compensation courtesy of an abundance of chocolate biscuits on a china plate ; panorama on one side , the normally faceless bureaucrats on the other .
we had contacted the cabinet office and the home office and explained that we were producing a rather unusual panorama , designed to assess the state of preparedness for a terrorist attack .

the cabinet office hosted an on-the-record meeting and the home office sent its representative .
on the face of it the cabinet office seemed willing to help - provided we agreed to organise our terrorist attack in a way that was acceptable to them .
this means car bombs are top of the list , with hostage or hijack coming in second .
we said we did not believe car bombs , hijacks or hostages reflected accurately the terrorist threat prevailing in the uk .
not because we wanted to be difficult but because all our research suggested these were remnants of a bygone era of terrorism .
they were also events the emergency services had good experience of , would deal with admirably and would be unlikely to warrant major incident plans being put in place .
co-operation refused we said that a fictional terrorist attack warranted " thinking out of the box " and that it would be a good thing to examine the civil contingency efforts of government since the shocking events of 9/11 .
our scenario centred on a series of suicide bombs on the london underground followed by a chlorine tanker exploding in the east end of london .
however , they said they were unlikely to help us if we insisted on this " irresponsible " scenario .
they said it would give ideas to the terrorists because terrorists watch television .
but they said they would need to talk to their bosses - the politicians - to gauge their view but that it was unlikely their view would be markedly different .
nothing irresponsible a scene from panorama 's docu-drama london under attack we tried to assure them that , as the bbc 's flagship current affairs programme , we were far from irresponsible and took the matter very seriously indeed .
they would not be moved .
we agreed to go away and review our scenario in light of their reservations and we left .
to strengthen our case , we prepared a meticulous document which outlined the reasons why we had elected to pursue this particular scenario .
we got in touch with the cabinet office and arranged a second meeting where we hoped we could raise some of our research with them to show that there was nothing irresponsible about our actions .
on the morning of the meeting , i received a phone call from the cabinet office to say that , given that we were refusing to move from our proposed scenario , there was no purpose to the meeting .
i demurred and said the research was valuable and deserved proper debate .
they were not persuaded .
the new year dawned and we continued our research .
although we never had a second meeting and we had no further contact of any note , we were constantly aware of the presence of the cabinet office .
wall of silence the less discreet officials in these organisations revealed that their lack of participation was not their decision but resulted from an e-mail sent by " senior government officials " it was fairly straightforward , really .
we would call the press office of any one of the myriad organisations officially involved with civil contingencies .

the manner of termination varied from the polite promise to call back , referral to a colleague who would decline to comment and finally the downright rude .

he said troops should be withdrawn from iraq as soon as a democratic government was in place .
mr cook , who left the cabinet over his opposition to military action in iraq , also called on mr blair to distance himself from president bush .
he made his comments in an interview for the sunday programme on gmtv .
mr cook 's comments came after mr blair said he continued to stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the us president , insisting that now was the wrong time to " start messing around with your main ally " .
mr cook said the prime minister 's loyalty to mr bush was causing concern within the labour party , with many members unable to understand why he had allied himself so closely with " one of the most right-wing presidents we have seen in the us for a long time " . "
i personally think we need an exit strategy that says as soon as elections have been held , as soon as there is a democratic government to run iraq , we 're getting out " robin cook on saturday , the us , uk , italy and japan said they would pull their troops out of iraq , if asked by a new iraqi government .
the four countries made their position clear following a meeting of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- foreign ministers in washington .
mr cook said the government should plan a way to pull out british troops .
" we really do need to get elections quickly , find a genuinely representative government of iraq , recognise that frankly it 's not going to be sympathetic to the coalition forces who are now so unpopular in iraq , " he said .
" and i personally think we need an exit strategy that says as soon as elections have been held , as soon as there is a democratic government to run iraq , we 're getting out . "
mr cook has been critical of the us presence in iraq in the past .
last month he said us forces in iraq must stop " acting like warriors and start acting like peacekeepers " .

istanbul 's abdi ipecki stadium is usually a sweaty basketball stadium , but was transformed into a stage fit for one of the biggest musical events in the world .
with an enthusiastic capacity crowd flying flags of many nations , the atmosphere was electric - clearly this contest was shaping up as a night to remember .
last year 's turkish victor sertab erener set the stadium ablaze with a rousing rendition of her winning song , surrounded by a coterie of gold-dusted nymphs and then the magical whirling dervishes .
presenters meltem cumbul and korhan abay followed the eurovision tradition for elaborate costumes , indulging in cheesy banter and slightly stilted delivery .
but the crowd had turned out to see 24 live performances , cheer on their favourites and see who could live up to the big occasion .
ukraine 's leather-clad ruslana won with wild dance this year 's contest turned out to be a melting pot of musical flavours , with many worthy of winning - and the others being relegated to musical also-rans .
the winning performance was enough to cause a riot in the stadium , with ukraine 's ruslana packing a fur-clad , whip-cracking punch which bowled over the audience and europe alike .
serbia and montenegro 's captivating folk tune was the first that really drew a response from the stadium crowd , with an intense hush followed by a thunderous reception for singer zeljko joksimovic and a deserving runners-up spot .
greece and turkey were also huge crowd-pleasers in istanbul , with sakis rouvas providing some great moves and a touch of deft undressing , and local heroes athena sending the arena into a cacophony of chanting , clapping and pogoing - but it was n't quite convincing enough for eurovision voters .
the uk 's james fox inspired some patriotic flag-waving from the british camp , but the stadium seemed to find him just too gentle and easy-going and the do-or-die eurovision vote left the welshman languishing in the doldrums of 16th place .
there was little scandal this year - apart from the question of political voting , with the balkans countries giving higher points to each other 's entries .
but this felt less acute at the actual arena than it did to viewers - though there were howls when greece and cyprus gave each other maximum points .
from this end without a british commentary in my ear , the voting made perfect sense - the balkan countries have a common heritage and it made sense here in the stadium that they appreciate each other 's music .
and when eurovision fans get together , there is more sense of enjoying the songs and performances regardless of country - britons were dancing to sweden 's entry , we cheered when ukraine got maximum points - and even louder when the uk scraped together a few .
but there were also a few jeers for belarus giving slavic brothers russia maximum points - when frankly it was a weak performance .
france 's jonatan cerrada led a trend for white suits the turks put on a riotously colourful and scintillating interval act which filled the stage and was a clever anatolian take on ireland 's riverdance .
instead of being a time filler , this was true entertainment which won the unanimous approval of abdi ipecki 's eurovision devotees - quite unlike some of the competing songs .
experiencing eurovision in the flesh is on occasion not to be forgotten and a million miles away from watching it on the small screen at home - even if it means missing terry wogan 's legendary commentary .
turkey 's first contest was a huge success with few hitches , and will ensure eurovision survives well beyond its 50th year in 2005 - in kiev .

over the last year , the amount of rubbish householders in oxfordshire have thrown away is down by 2.6 % .
but the council admits it expects waste to increase and that in 15 years it will have to deal with another 100,000 tonnes of rubbish - a third more .
a new solution will have to be found for the waste as the council will not be allowed to send it to landfill .
to fit in with european legislation , the government has set the county a deadline to reduce landfilling by 40 % by 2010 .
councillor anne purse said : " we have done so well in helping people to reduce rubbish , we urge people to continue to see rubbish as a resource .
" throwing stuff in the bin is just a waste , and the sooner we all realise this , the better off we shall all be . "
