the game got underway with both sides showing a lot of caution .
france looked to exploit both flanks early on with robert pires and zinedine zidane drifting out wide at every opportunity .
their industry carved out a third minute effort for thierry henry but his header lacked venom and nikopolidis watched it sail harmlessly wide .
greece then had their own heading chance .
charisteas was almost on a speculative cross into the box but the high ball eluded him and the threat passed .
the first yellow card came just seconds later when karagounis dragged zidane to the floor by the shirt after the french playmaker had drifted past him on the right flank .
greece seemed to be settling faster than france and when a mistake by william gallas sent nikolaidis free through the midfield , mikael silvestre could only foul the midfielder as he headed towards goal.the free-kick however was wasted and floated safely into the hands of fabien barthez .
five minutes later , greece had another good effort with barthez was equal to .

greece thought the lead was theirs then real drama struck .
greece sent in another free-kick which evaded the french defense and katsouranis apparently poked the ball over the line beyond barthez .
was it a goal ?
the linesman waved play on as the greeks protested wildly .
replays showed that barthez had prevented the whole of the ball crossing the line .
greece had been unlucky but not cheated .
france were being forced into operating in tight areas with the greek defenders closing in ate evry opportunity , preventing the free-flowing football which the french can produce to such devastating effect .
coach otto rehhagel had obviously studied his opponents well as greece showed discipline and mental strength in the opening 20 minutes .
sloppy play on both sides both sides then had a spell of making simple mistakes and losing possession .
one mistake by the greeks then set lizarazu free on the left .
he raced past his marker and fired a cross into the greek penalty area .
henry rose well above the center-back but steered his header just wide in the first clear chance for france .
greece had another good opportunity just before the hal hour mark .
a cross from the right found katsouranis on the edge of the box but his volley skimed off the turf and into the hands of barthez .
lull in action looked terminal the game seemd to die for a while with the crowd growing restless at the stifling tactics of the greeks and the frustrating patient build-up of the french .
the first half ended on a sour note with the crowd booing the teams off .
the second half started in much the same way .
it looked to be heading for a 90 minute stalemate until thierry henry caused the crowd to wake up with a shot on the turn which was just deflected behind by a defender .
the france striker reacted in horror as the linesman indicates for a goal-kick in an indication of how the french team 's luck would be for the rest of the night .
more stifling play and a match looking devoid of invention looked set to bore the 45,000 crowd to death until a sensational turn of events brought the stadium , and france to life .
champions rocked by charisteas on 65 minutes , greece rocked the champions .
bixente lizarazu wasbeaten on the right by zagorakis who fired in a high cross and angelos charisteas powered his header past barthez .
france coach jacques santini threw on louis saha and sylvain wiltord to bolster the attack and for a while france looked like they would overwhelm the greeks and get back into the game but greece weathered the storm and even created a few more chances of their own .
france drifted further and further out of the tournament as the game wore on to its conclusion until thierry henry had the chance to put a safe hand on the henri delauney trophy when his clear header was met with power with no defender in sight .
but as the ball dropped just past the post , france 's grip on the henri delauney trophy looked to have slipped right off .
france drop the cup les bleus then dropped the cup completely when lizarazu blasted over from the edge of the arae with two minutes of added time to play .
it was the final chance for the champions and when anders frisk blew the final whistle , the seemingly impossible was confirmed to be reality .

u.s. president bush is meeting eu leaders in ireland for talks intended to heal the transatlantic rift and dominated by iraq , the middle east and terrorism .
the summit takes place amid tight security and protests . european commission president romano prodi set the tone for the meeting of eu and u.s. leaders in a pre-summit press release .
" i am confident that this summit will be an opportunity to revitalize our partnership with the u.s. this partnership is indispensable not only for the transatlantic community but for the world at large , " prodi said .
more than a year after the iraq war , relations are still in need of reanimation . " both sides have an interest in a ' fair-weather ' summit , during which the disagreements over the iraq war can finally be laid to rest , " janis emmanouilidis of munich 's center for applied policy research told dw-world .
" both parties need a stable iraq , and both know that they 'll continue to need a strong transatlantic relationship . " this realization partly stems from self-interest , said franz-josef meiers of the center for european integration research in bonn .
" president bush has to prove for the coming elections that he 's not just the commander-in-chief , but that he 's also capable of getting the allies back on board .
and it 's become clear to france and germany that a policy of opposition to the u.s. in the un security council is not in their interests . " emmanouilidis does n't expect any key strategic decisions to emerge from the summit .
" the time is not right for that , " he said .
" it 's still not certain whether the current u.s. administration will be in office again next year . " when it comes to the three main topics on the agenda - iraq , the middle east , and counter-terrorism measures - experts say the most that can be expected is a resolution to calling for the continuation of the fight against terrorism , for example , through tighter cooperation between intelligence services on both sides of the atlantic . iraq clouds summit the two sides will issue a joint statement on iraq , just days before the june 30 handover of sovereignty from u.s.-led occupying troops to the newly appointed iraqi interim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the iraqi civil defense corps -lrb- icdc -rrb- collects human remains at the site of a bombing which occurred at a checkpoint on the southern edge of baghdad , iraq on thursday. government .
it comes at a sensitive time , since the u.s. has admitted it faces a serious problem with the insurgency in iraq , which again manifested itself on thursday with a coordinated series of bombings that left more than 100 people dead in five iraqi cities . in an interview on thursday with ireland 's rte television , bush defended his decision to invade iraq .
he disputed the interviewer 's assertion that most irish people thougth the world was a more dangerous place in the wake of the iraq war .
" what was it like sept .
11th , 2001 ? " he retorted .
" i would n't have made the decisions i did if i did n't believe the world would be better .
why would i put people in harm 's way if i did n't believe the world would be better ? " massive security operation bush 's visit has sparked widespread protests in ireland with between 5,000 and 10,000 people marching through dublin on friday night .
around 600 protested at shannon , the airport where he landed . many marchers vowed to cross ireland and hold more protests near dromoland castle , the site of the summit .
demonstrators are n't just protesting against u.s. policies in iraq , but also the role of the irish government .
bertie ahern 's administration has come in for heavy domestic criticism for allowing thousands of u.s. jets to refuel at shannon en route to the middle east . the area however has been cordoned off by around 4,000 irish police and soldiers , making it the biggest security operation in the country 's history . eu pressured to address torture claims during the discussions , experts say the eu will be keen to flex some political muscle and show that it 's a force to be reckoned with .
jim foster , deputy head of the u.s. mission to the eu , said the fact that the bloc recently gained 10 new members , adopted a constitution and approved a common security strategy has raised its status in u.s. eyes .
" from the u.s. side , there 's a clear recognition that relations with the european union matter , " foster said . pressure from human rights organizations is mounting on the eu to use some of that political clout to make clear its position on the american treatment of prisoners in iraq , afghanistan , and guantanamo bay , cuba .
amnesty international has called on summit host and irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- to end the eu 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee from afghanistan is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated by military officials at camp x-ray at the u.s. naval base in guantanamo bay , cuba . " embarrassing silence " in the face of recent revelations about u.s. abuse of prisoners .
" there has been no indication that this has at any stage been taken up officially and forcefully with the u.s. government , " amnesty said . documents released by the white house showed defense secretary donald rumsfeld in december 2002 approving harsh interrogation techniques for prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba , such as hooding , stripping and isolating them and using dogs to intimidate them .
by mid-january 2003 , rumsfeld 's approval was suspended .

henry rose well above the center-back but steered his header just wide in the first clear chance for france .
greece had another good opportunity just before the hal hour mark .
a cross from the right found katsouranis on the edge of the box but his volley skimed off the turf and into the hands of barthez .
lull in action looked terminal the game seemd to die for a while with the crowd growing restless at the stifling tactics of the greeks and the frustrating patient build-up of the french .
the first half ended on a sour note with the crowd booing the teams off .
the second half started in much the same way .
it looked to be heading for a 90 minute stalemate until thierry henry caused the crowd to wake up with a shot on the turn which was just deflected behind by a defender .
the france striker reacted in horror as the linesman indicates for a goal-kick in an indication of how the french team 's luck would be for the rest of the night .
more stifling play and a match looking devoid of invention looked set to bore the 45,000 crowd to death until a sensational turn of events brought the stadium , and france to life .
champions rocked by charisteas on 65 minutes , greece rocked the champions .
bixente lizarazu wasbeaten on the right by zagorakis who fired in a high cross and angelos charisteas powered his header past barthez .
france coach jacques santini threw on louis saha and sylvain wiltord to bolster the attack and for a while france looked like they would overwhelm the greeks and get back into the game but greece weathered the storm and even created a few more chances of their own .
france drifted further and further out of the tournament as the game wore on to its conclusion until thierry henry had the chance to put a safe hand on the henri delauney trophy when his clear header was met with power with no defender in sight .
but as the ball dropped just past the post , france 's grip on the henri delauney trophy looked to have slipped right off .
france drop the cup les bleus then dropped the cup completely when lizarazu blasted over from the edge of the arae with two minutes of added time to play .
it was the final chance for the champions and when anders frisk blew the final whistle , the seemingly impossible was confirmed to be reality .
greece had beaten france .
france : barthez , gallas , thuram , silvestre , lizarazu , zidane , dacourt , makelele , pires , henry , trezeguet .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , karagounis , katsouranis , zagorakis , basinas , nikolaidis , charisteas .

u.s. president bush is meeting eu leaders in ireland for talks intended to heal the transatlantic rift and dominated by iraq , the middle east and terrorism .
the summit takes place amid tight security and protests . european commission president romano prodi set the tone for the meeting of eu and u.s. leaders in a pre-summit press release .
" i am confident that this summit will be an opportunity to revitalize our partnership with the u.s. this partnership is indispensable not only for the transatlantic community but for the world at large , " prodi said .
more than a year after the iraq war , relations are still in need of reanimation . " both sides have an interest in a ' fair-weather ' summit , during which the disagreements over the iraq war can finally be laid to rest , " janis emmanouilidis of munich 's center for applied policy research told dw-world .
" both parties need a stable iraq , and both know that they 'll continue to need a strong transatlantic relationship . " this realization partly stems from self-interest , said franz-josef meiers of the center for european integration research in bonn .
" president bush has to prove for the coming elections that he 's not just the commander-in-chief , but that he 's also capable of getting the allies back on board .
and it 's become clear to france and germany that a policy of opposition to the u.s. in the un security council is not in their interests . " emmanouilidis does n't expect any key strategic decisions to emerge from the summit .
" the time is not right for that , " he said .
" it 's still not certain whether the current u.s. administration will be in office again next year . " when it comes to the three main topics on the agenda - iraq , the middle east , and counter-terrorism measures - experts say the most that can be expected is a resolution to calling for the continuation of the fight against terrorism , for example , through tighter cooperation between intelligence services on both sides of the atlantic . iraq clouds summit the two sides will issue a joint statement on iraq , just days before the june 30 handover of sovereignty from u.s.-led occupying troops to the newly appointed iraqi interim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the iraqi civil defense corps -lrb- icdc -rrb- collects human remains at the site of a bombing which occurred at a checkpoint on the southern edge of baghdad , iraq on thursday. government .
it comes at a sensitive time , since the u.s. has admitted it faces a serious problem with the insurgency in iraq , which again manifested itself on thursday with a coordinated series of bombings that left more than 100 people dead in five iraqi cities . in an interview on thursday with ireland 's rte television , bush defended his decision to invade iraq .
he disputed the interviewer 's assertion that most irish people thougth the world was a more dangerous place in the wake of the iraq war .
" what was it like sept .
11th , 2001 ? " he retorted .
" i would n't have made the decisions i did if i did n't believe the world would be better .
why would i put people in harm 's way if i did n't believe the world would be better ? " massive security operation bush 's visit has sparked widespread protests in ireland with between 5,000 and 10,000 people marching through dublin on friday night .
around 600 protested at shannon , the airport where he landed . many marchers vowed to cross ireland and hold more protests near dromoland castle , the site of the summit .
demonstrators are n't just protesting against u.s. policies in iraq , but also the role of the irish government .
bertie ahern 's administration has come in for heavy domestic criticism for allowing thousands of u.s. jets to refuel at shannon en route to the middle east . the area however has been cordoned off by around 4,000 irish police and soldiers , making it the biggest security operation in the country 's history . eu pressured to address torture claims during the discussions , experts say the eu will be keen to flex some political muscle and show that it 's a force to be reckoned with .
jim foster , deputy head of the u.s. mission to the eu , said the fact that the bloc recently gained 10 new members , adopted a constitution and approved a common security strategy has raised its status in u.s. eyes .
" from the u.s. side , there 's a clear recognition that relations with the european union matter , " foster said . pressure from human rights organizations is mounting on the eu to use some of that political clout to make clear its position on the american treatment of prisoners in iraq , afghanistan , and guantanamo bay , cuba .

the summit takes place amid tight security and protests . european commission president romano prodi set the tone for the meeting of eu and u.s. leaders in a pre-summit press release .
" i am confident that this summit will be an opportunity to revitalize our partnership with the u.s. this partnership is indispensable not only for the transatlantic community but for the world at large , " prodi said .
more than a year after the iraq war , relations are still in need of reanimation . " both sides have an interest in a ' fair-weather ' summit , during which the disagreements over the iraq war can finally be laid to rest , " janis emmanouilidis of munich 's center for applied policy research told dw-world .
" both parties need a stable iraq , and both know that they 'll continue to need a strong transatlantic relationship . " this realization partly stems from self-interest , said franz-josef meiers of the center for european integration research in bonn .
" president bush has to prove for the coming elections that he 's not just the commander-in-chief , but that he 's also capable of getting the allies back on board .
and it 's become clear to france and germany that a policy of opposition to the u.s. in the un security council is not in their interests . " emmanouilidis does n't expect any key strategic decisions to emerge from the summit .
" the time is not right for that , " he said .
" it 's still not certain whether the current u.s. administration will be in office again next year . " when it comes to the three main topics on the agenda - iraq , the middle east , and counter-terrorism measures - experts say the most that can be expected is a resolution to calling for the continuation of the fight against terrorism , for example , through tighter cooperation between intelligence services on both sides of the atlantic . iraq clouds summit the two sides will issue a joint statement on iraq , just days before the june 30 handover of sovereignty from u.s.-led occupying troops to the newly appointed iraqi interim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the iraqi civil defense corps -lrb- icdc -rrb- collects human remains at the site of a bombing which occurred at a checkpoint on the southern edge of baghdad , iraq on thursday. government .
it comes at a sensitive time , since the u.s. has admitted it faces a serious problem with the insurgency in iraq , which again manifested itself on thursday with a coordinated series of bombings that left more than 100 people dead in five iraqi cities . in an interview on thursday with ireland 's rte television , bush defended his decision to invade iraq .
he disputed the interviewer 's assertion that most irish people thougth the world was a more dangerous place in the wake of the iraq war .
" what was it like sept .
11th , 2001 ? " he retorted .
" i would n't have made the decisions i did if i did n't believe the world would be better .
why would i put people in harm 's way if i did n't believe the world would be better ? " massive security operation bush 's visit has sparked widespread protests in ireland with between 5,000 and 10,000 people marching through dublin on friday night .
around 600 protested at shannon , the airport where he landed . many marchers vowed to cross ireland and hold more protests near dromoland castle , the site of the summit .
demonstrators are n't just protesting against u.s. policies in iraq , but also the role of the irish government .
bertie ahern 's administration has come in for heavy domestic criticism for allowing thousands of u.s. jets to refuel at shannon en route to the middle east . the area however has been cordoned off by around 4,000 irish police and soldiers , making it the biggest security operation in the country 's history . eu pressured to address torture claims during the discussions , experts say the eu will be keen to flex some political muscle and show that it 's a force to be reckoned with .
jim foster , deputy head of the u.s. mission to the eu , said the fact that the bloc recently gained 10 new members , adopted a constitution and approved a common security strategy has raised its status in u.s. eyes .
" from the u.s. side , there 's a clear recognition that relations with the european union matter , " foster said . pressure from human rights organizations is mounting on the eu to use some of that political clout to make clear its position on the american treatment of prisoners in iraq , afghanistan , and guantanamo bay , cuba .

" embarrassing silence " in the face of recent revelations about u.s. abuse of prisoners .
" there has been no indication that this has at any stage been taken up officially and forcefully with the u.s. government , " amnesty said . documents released by the white house showed defense secretary donald rumsfeld in december 2002 approving harsh interrogation techniques for prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba , such as hooding , stripping and isolating them and using dogs to intimidate them .

the ruling cambodian people 's party and the royalist funcinpec party said they had agreed to form a government .
cambodia has been run by a caretaker government led by the cpp 's hun sen since inconclusive elections last year .
the cpp won 73 of the 123 seats in the national assembly , but needed a two-thirds majority to govern alone .
funcinpec and another opposition party , the sam rainsy party , boycotted the opening session of parliament , saying the elections were biased towards the cpp .
funcinpec won 26 seats and the sam rainsy party won 24 .
the agreement was announced in a joint statement by hun sen and funcinpec leader prince norodom ranariddh .
under the deal , the cpp will hold 60 % of the cabinet portfolios , while funcinpec will get the rest .

the exiled tibetan spiritual leader had publicly urged the company not to go ahead with the plans .
he said the mass slaughter of chickens violated tibet 's traditional values .
kfc 's parent company , yum brands , says it has called off plans to operate in tibet because it does not think it would be profitable .
concern for chickens an animal rights group peta -lrb- people for the ethical treatment of animals -rrb- published a letter from the dalai lama this week calling on yum brands to rethink its decision .
in the letter , the dalai lama said that tibetans rarely consumed chicken and fish before china took control of tibet .
instead , he said , tibetans traditionally ate larger animals such as yaks - of which fewer had to be killed .
the dalai lama , exiled in the indian hill town of dharamsala since 1959 , said that introduction of " industrial food practices " into tibet would perpetuate animal suffering .
he said in the letter : " i have been particularly concerned with the sufferings of chickens for many years .
" it was the death of a chicken that finally strengthened my resolve to become vegetarian .
" these days , when i see a row of plucked chickens hanging in a meat shop , it hurts .
' not economically feasible ' yum brands , which operates kentucky fried chicken outlets in most of china , said in january that it was considering opening outlets in tibet .
following this week 's publicity over the dalai lama 's letter , the company now says it has given up on the idea .
but it says the decision was taken some time ago , before the dalai lama 's intervention .
" we did look into entering tibet earlier in the year , " spokesman jonathan blum told reuters news agency .
" but we decided not to move forward because it is n't economically feasible for us to do business there today . "
a spokesman for the dalai lama in dharamsala , tenzin taklha , told bbc news online : " we welcome the decision of kfc . "
however , yum brands has not permanently crossed tibet off its marketing possibilities .
" maybe someday it will be less costly and we 'll continue to explore this option at that time , " mr blum said .
there are more than 1,000 kfc outlets in china , which is yum 's fastest growing and most profitable market outside the us .
the dalai lama fled chinese-occupied tibet in 1959 after a failed coup attempt , but in recent years has been trying to engage beijing in negotiations over a potential return .

the silver ring thing encourages teenagers to buy a silver ring as a sign of them pledging to remain celibate until they get married .
the scheme has sold 20,000 rings to youngsters in the united states .
but the sexual health charity brook says the scheme could lead to problems because it does not teach teenagers about contraception .
the silver ring thing movement , visiting the betel of britain centre in the city on saturday , is funded partly by the bush administration , which is a strong supporter of abstinence .
the ring is meant to act a constant reminder for a young person not be tempted to become sexually active .

the day after sven goran eriksson 's men were denied a semi-final place by portugal , faked joke images arrived in email inboxes to poke fun at the loss .
captain david beckham 's penalty miss and disputed decisions by swiss referee urs meier bore the brunt of jibes .
meanwhile a supermarket chain offered free eye tests to swiss nationals .
asda said it was making the pledge after mr meier 's decision to disallow england defender sol campbell 's last-minute goal .
an email entitled " urs meier is waiting to hear from you " was also doing the rounds .
the message contained a link to the feedback page of the referee 's website , although no english opinions had been published .
advertising campaigns prove an easier target than the goal as england supporters sat deflated at their desks , a selection of faked football photos were exchanged .
one email , with the subject " that explains it " , featured meier arguing with campbell while holding a guide-dog to heel .
other images focussed their sarcasm on david beckham 's missed penalty .
in a twist on a sports advertising campaign , he was pictured taking tips from england rugby hero jonny wilkinson on how to sail it right over the bar .
wilkinson advises : " and to win , i just kicked the ball over the bar " , as beckham memorises : " ball ... bar ... over ... win ... "
another picture played on his complaints about the surface after his penalty-kick miss - it showed a mole , complete with molehill , popping out from under the ball .
photos from beckham 's book-launch also came in for treatment by the graphics experts .
david beckham 's failed penalty kick is fodder for picture-fakers my side , his autobiography , was exchanged for a tome he might reach for at real madrid : " zinedine zidane 's penalty taking for dummies " .
a doctored advert from a major credit card campaign was also circulated , alongside a picture of the missed spot-kick .
it reads : " " hotel for the missus : £ 1,000 .
sunblock for brooklyn : £ 30 .
missing two penalties in a major competition : priceless . "
the losing side and the referee were the focus of most of the jokes but the portuguese players did not escape to victory completely unscathed .
cristiano ronaldo was featured in a less than flattering portrayal of english opinion on european playing styles .
a moving email graphic showed him performing a series of stepovers , before an opponent kicks the ball away .
seconds later , unchallenged and untouched , he falls over .

the government had feared a flood of applications from students wanting to begin university before fees are raised in 2006 .
but it has now agreed to make an amendment to the higher education bill in order to prevent students wanting to take a year out being penalised .
fees for english students at scottish universities however will rise to prevent a flood of applications there .
if you would like to comment on student fees please send us your comments on the e-mail form below .
are you a concerned student or parent worried by the rise in fees ?
perhaps you believe it is fair enough that students pay for their own education .
or do you think higher education should be funded in a different way ?
higher education benefits all of society , so society should pay for it .
new labour 's mean attitude ... is shameful mick portman if graduates get greater rewards , they may reimburse society by paying higher taxes .
new labour 's mean attitude to education as a means of money making , rather than a right of all citizens -lrb- not just the rich -rrb- is shameful .
new blair and his chums who benefit from society 's generous funding of their education should be ashamed of their attempt to deny working class children of access to higher education .
mick portman i can see why it is felt that students should pay something for the enormous benefit a higher education brings .
but , having left school at 15 and contributed for 39 years to the higher education and living costs of those who are now in power over me , i do find it distressing that no help is available for my own , very bright , children .
i had always hoped they would be able to seize the opportunities that had not been available to those of us educated in secondary modern schools in the pre-wilson years .
i have not yet done the sums , but it looks as if we are pretty borderline , not quite poor enough to qualify for maximum help but not rich enough to be able to support our daughter if she decides to study away from home .
i just wish that there was some additional help for families like mine barbara bernard i note that the parental contribution formula allows £ 1,000 of income to be disregarded for our younger son but takes no account of the higher cost of living in london .
i just wish that there was some additional help for families like mine , whose children are well above average ability but who would be first-generation undergraduates .
barbara bernard i am a recently retired teacher and am worried about the ' debt culture ' that our young people are being encouraged to join , with student loans which will remain unpaid until their salaries reach £ 15,000 per annum .
we will also be paying for loans to students from the other 24 eu countries patricia ritchie the taxpayer is indirectly funding student loans and soon we will also be paying for loans to students from the other 24 eu countries .
many of those students will never earn £ 15,000 in their own countries and will therefore presumably never have to pay back the loans .
i feel sure that most taxpayers , like me , will be far from delighted by this .
i also feel sure none of the other eu governments are giving such generous terms to the british students who might wish to study in their countries .
our government is aware that this new funding bill for further education leaves us open to the difficulty of recovering money from eu students , so perhaps the whole bill should be re-drafted before we get ourselves in as much of a mess with education funding as we have with immigration and asylum policy .
it will be too late if we leave it until 2006 , when the full impact of the bill will be felt .

chief constable richard brunstrom said many of the report 's recommendations apply to the home office and the home secretary , not to the police service .
david blunkett has threatened legal action if police chiefs do not suspend a chief constable named in the report .
the report criticised humberside 's david westwood for poor record-keeping .
police chiefs are refusing to comply with the home secretary 's order to suspend mr westwood of humberside police after sir michael bichard highlighted his force 's failure to keep records of allegations of sexual assault against ian huntley before he moved to soham .
on 17 december 2003 huntley was found guilty of murdering the schoolgirls jessica chapman and holly wells .
the police reform act 2002 allows the home secretary to force the suspension of a chief constable in the interests of " efficiency and effectiveness " .
scapegoat split mr brunstrom told the bbc radio 4 's today programme the bichard inquiry report directed much of its criticism at successive home secretaries , including mr blunkett , for their " lack of leadership " over recent years .
he said : " a significant number of the 31 recommendations in the report apply to the home office and home secretary , not to the police service .
" i rather wish that some more people from the home office were standing up to take responsibility for this . "
i should emphasise that i have not required the police authority to sack mr westwood home secretary david blunkett your view : should he resign ?
blunkett 's statement debra shipley , the labour mp for stourbridge told the bbc mr blunkett was right to calling for mr westwood 's resignation .
she said : " the bichard report was a very clear look at what happened .
" cambridgeshire was shown to have been poor in what it had done ... but in humberside the report showed it had an embedded , very poorly administrated system which was poorly managed and that 's down to the chief constable . "
" the whole thing was a huge failure from the top , " she added .
