program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 torture photos traumatize refugees in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disturbing , especially for victims of torture .
officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .

the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .
just like german families , they often have exaggerated expectations of a perfect family that are modelled after tv commercials . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to close gender gap germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .

but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .

" the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .

according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .

the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition .

" we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .

he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .

no other european port handles as much imports from and exports to china as the one in hamburg .
port officials plan to expand cooperation with chinese ports in the future even further . last year , 1.3 million containers from and to china passed through hamburg 's port , up almost 15 percent from 2002 .
that 's about one sixth of the port 's business , making china the city state 's most important trade partner .
both sides expect double-digit growth rates in the future .
shipping companies are already setting up new systems to deal with demand . as a result , shanghai and hamburg harbors plan to work together more closely in the future , said manfred reuter , who works for hamburg 's economic and labor agency during a recent visit to shanghai . " shanghai port is the world 's third largest container port and has immense growth potential , " reuter told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected shanghai to climb to the top spot relatively soon .
" we believe that our port can also benefit from an exchange of ideas and know-how .
we 're interested in finding out more about the way asian ports are financed . " an employee exchange is one way in which hamburg hopes to benefit from chinese knowledge about port construction and management , reuter said . china 's gateway to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young woman stands in front of shanghai 's skyline .
the city 's port can be seen to the left in the background .
while china mainly exports electronic equipment , clothes and toys via ships , germany sends maschines and car parts across the oceans .
chinese ships usually dock in hamburg , because its location makes it easier to get good to other european destinations than the dutch ports of antwerpen or rotterdam , according to reuter . " china is a highly competitive market for the northern european ports , " reuter said , adding that hamburg has managed to position itself as the winner so far .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .

today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .

children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .

no other european port handles as much imports from and exports to china as the one in hamburg .
port officials plan to expand cooperation with chinese ports in the future even further . last year , 1.3 million containers from and to china passed through hamburg 's port , up almost 15 percent from 2002 .
that 's about one sixth of the port 's business , making china the city state 's most important trade partner .
both sides expect double-digit growth rates in the future .
shipping companies are already setting up new systems to deal with demand . as a result , shanghai and hamburg harbors plan to work together more closely in the future , said manfred reuter , who works for hamburg 's economic and labor agency during a recent visit to shanghai . " shanghai port is the world 's third largest container port and has immense growth potential , " reuter told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected shanghai to climb to the top spot relatively soon .
" we believe that our port can also benefit from an exchange of ideas and know-how .
we 're interested in finding out more about the way asian ports are financed . " an employee exchange is one way in which hamburg hopes to benefit from chinese knowledge about port construction and management , reuter said . china 's gateway to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young woman stands in front of shanghai 's skyline .
the city 's port can be seen to the left in the background .
while china mainly exports electronic equipment , clothes and toys via ships , germany sends maschines and car parts across the oceans .
chinese ships usually dock in hamburg , because its location makes it easier to get good to other european destinations than the dutch ports of antwerpen or rotterdam , according to reuter . " china is a highly competitive market for the northern european ports , " reuter said , adding that hamburg has managed to position itself as the winner so far .
" for china , we are the gateway to the emerging markets of central , southern and eastern europe , where many chinese products go . " hamburg and shanghai are sister cities and have been doing business with each other for more than 130 years .
china 's two big shipping companies , cosco and china shipping , have offices in hamburg , as do 320 other companies from the people 's republic . on the other hand , a hamburg port consulting firm is involved in infrastructure planning for a new deep sea port in shanghai that 's currently under construction to deal with rising demand .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .

according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .

" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .

" the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .

" whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .

no other european port handles as much imports from and exports to china as the one in hamburg .
port officials plan to expand cooperation with chinese ports in the future even further . last year , 1.3 million containers from and to china passed through hamburg 's port , up almost 15 percent from 2002 .
that 's about one sixth of the port 's business , making china the city state 's most important trade partner .
both sides expect double-digit growth rates in the future .
shipping companies are already setting up new systems to deal with demand . as a result , shanghai and hamburg harbors plan to work together more closely in the future , said manfred reuter , who works for hamburg 's economic and labor agency during a recent visit to shanghai . " shanghai port is the world 's third largest container port and has immense growth potential , " reuter told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected shanghai to climb to the top spot relatively soon .
" we believe that our port can also benefit from an exchange of ideas and know-how .
we 're interested in finding out more about the way asian ports are financed . " an employee exchange is one way in which hamburg hopes to benefit from chinese knowledge about port construction and management , reuter said . china 's gateway to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young woman stands in front of shanghai 's skyline .
the city 's port can be seen to the left in the background .
while china mainly exports electronic equipment , clothes and toys via ships , germany sends maschines and car parts across the oceans .
chinese ships usually dock in hamburg , because its location makes it easier to get good to other european destinations than the dutch ports of antwerpen or rotterdam , according to reuter . " china is a highly competitive market for the northern european ports , " reuter said , adding that hamburg has managed to position itself as the winner so far .
" for china , we are the gateway to the emerging markets of central , southern and eastern europe , where many chinese products go . " hamburg and shanghai are sister cities and have been doing business with each other for more than 130 years .
china 's two big shipping companies , cosco and china shipping , have offices in hamburg , as do 320 other companies from the people 's republic . on the other hand , a hamburg port consulting firm is involved in infrastructure planning for a new deep sea port in shanghai that 's currently under construction to deal with rising demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .
just like german families , they often have exaggerated expectations of a perfect family that are modelled after tv commercials . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to close gender gap germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .

" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .

according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .

but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .

" whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .
" the most important thing is to set up a protective center in iraq , where the victims - who need moral and psychological help - are first assured they are safe here .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .

children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

no other european port handles as much imports from and exports to china as the one in hamburg .
port officials plan to expand cooperation with chinese ports in the future even further . last year , 1.3 million containers from and to china passed through hamburg 's port , up almost 15 percent from 2002 .
that 's about one sixth of the port 's business , making china the city state 's most important trade partner .
both sides expect double-digit growth rates in the future .
shipping companies are already setting up new systems to deal with demand . as a result , shanghai and hamburg harbors plan to work together more closely in the future , said manfred reuter , who works for hamburg 's economic and labor agency during a recent visit to shanghai . " shanghai port is the world 's third largest container port and has immense growth potential , " reuter told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected shanghai to climb to the top spot relatively soon .
" we believe that our port can also benefit from an exchange of ideas and know-how .
we 're interested in finding out more about the way asian ports are financed . " an employee exchange is one way in which hamburg hopes to benefit from chinese knowledge about port construction and management , reuter said . china 's gateway to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young woman stands in front of shanghai 's skyline .
the city 's port can be seen to the left in the background .
while china mainly exports electronic equipment , clothes and toys via ships , germany sends maschines and car parts across the oceans .
chinese ships usually dock in hamburg , because its location makes it easier to get good to other european destinations than the dutch ports of antwerpen or rotterdam , according to reuter . " china is a highly competitive market for the northern european ports , " reuter said , adding that hamburg has managed to position itself as the winner so far .
" for china , we are the gateway to the emerging markets of central , southern and eastern europe , where many chinese products go . " hamburg and shanghai are sister cities and have been doing business with each other for more than 130 years .
china 's two big shipping companies , cosco and china shipping , have offices in hamburg , as do 320 other companies from the people 's republic . on the other hand , a hamburg port consulting firm is involved in infrastructure planning for a new deep sea port in shanghai that 's currently under construction to deal with rising demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .
and experts believe the new law will do little to change this situation for a long time to come . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm crop trials underway throughout germany a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .

" whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 german parliament approves gene-food law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against gm crops bring out thousands of germans .
the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .
so the advantages will be visible to consumers and consumers will accept that . “ but so far , an overwhelming majority of germans are still strongly opposed to eating gene food .

the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations . the law , approved by the so-called bundesrat , which is made up of representatives of the 16 federal states , also provides for the labelling of foodstuffs produced on the basis of genetically-modified organisms .
it comes in the wake of a european union decision to throw out a ban on the sale of so-called gmo foods on the continent .
but the arrival of the shiny new world of gene-food is experiencing a rather rocky start . the divisions cut right across villages and local politicians even fear that barns may soon be burning and crops be devastated in what could become a modern-day peasants ‘ revolt .
the emerging rift in rural germany pitches gene-food advocates against conventional and organic farmers who fear contamination of their crops that could render them worthless . under the new law , however , conventional farmers will now be entitled to file for hefty damages in such a case .
in addition farmers opting for gmo crops will be forced to register with a national database .
they face fines of up to € 50,000 -lrb- $ 59,000 -rrb- or even prison terms of up to five years in cases of violations of farming regulations . in view of such stiff penalties , gerd sonnleitner , the president of the german farmers association , advises farmers against growing gene-manipulated crops . „ we can not advise our members to grow such crops , because of the stringent liability regulations included in the law by agriculture minister renate künast , " he said .
" full private liability means that no insurance company will insure anyone growing gene crops . “ law intended to deter gm crop production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast , a member of the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens , has made it abundantly clear that the new law is intended to deter farmers from opting for gene crops and to provide maximum food safety for consumers . regulations also include the clear labelling of all foodstuffs produced on the basis of gene-manipulated organisms , including food served in restaurants and canteens .
but food safety activists such as ulrike brendel from greenpeace germany , still criticize künast for allowing gene crops and foods at all . " nobody can predict what effects such a crude method will have on human health or the environment , " she said .
" since genetically-modified crops are grown in north america we have seen the impact on the environment and the farmland such as the development of superweeds or insecticide resistance .
and that ’ s just the beginning .
one has to note that all the research companies are doing is looking into yields and things like that . “ will consumers buy it ? so far gene-spliced crops , primarily maize , are grown on only 29 farms in germany , in a first phase of open-air testing .
advocates of the technology such as harald von witzke from berlin ’ s humboldt university are convinced that in the long-run consumers will come to appreciate the benefits of gene foods . " the first generation of biotechnology products has primarily benefited the producers because it has reduced costs , " he said .
" consumers haven ’ t benefited much yet .
biotechnology food of the second , third and fourth generation will have obvious advantages for instance the absence of proteins that cause allergies and things like that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2004 torture photos traumatize refugees in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disturbing , especially for victims of torture .
officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo .

no other european port handles as much imports from and exports to china as the one in hamburg .
port officials plan to expand cooperation with chinese ports in the future even further . last year , 1.3 million containers from and to china passed through hamburg 's port , up almost 15 percent from 2002 .
that 's about one sixth of the port 's business , making china the city state 's most important trade partner .
both sides expect double-digit growth rates in the future .
shipping companies are already setting up new systems to deal with demand . as a result , shanghai and hamburg harbors plan to work together more closely in the future , said manfred reuter , who works for hamburg 's economic and labor agency during a recent visit to shanghai . " shanghai port is the world 's third largest container port and has immense growth potential , " reuter told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected shanghai to climb to the top spot relatively soon .
" we believe that our port can also benefit from an exchange of ideas and know-how .
we 're interested in finding out more about the way asian ports are financed . " an employee exchange is one way in which hamburg hopes to benefit from chinese knowledge about port construction and management , reuter said . china 's gateway to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young woman stands in front of shanghai 's skyline .
the city 's port can be seen to the left in the background .
while china mainly exports electronic equipment , clothes and toys via ships , germany sends maschines and car parts across the oceans .
chinese ships usually dock in hamburg , because its location makes it easier to get good to other european destinations than the dutch ports of antwerpen or rotterdam , according to reuter . " china is a highly competitive market for the northern european ports , " reuter said , adding that hamburg has managed to position itself as the winner so far .
" for china , we are the gateway to the emerging markets of central , southern and eastern europe , where many chinese products go . " hamburg and shanghai are sister cities and have been doing business with each other for more than 130 years .
china 's two big shipping companies , cosco and china shipping , have offices in hamburg , as do 320 other companies from the people 's republic . on the other hand , a hamburg port consulting firm is involved in infrastructure planning for a new deep sea port in shanghai that 's currently under construction to deal with rising demand .
the new port is expected to open in 2006 . kerstin lohse -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg port builds anti-terror security system if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists .

officials at german centers for the treatment of torture victims say the graphic photographs of iraqi prisoner abuse have triggered painful memories among their patients , most of them asylum-seekers . the images of a naked iraqi man held on a dog leash by a female prison guard or that of an iraqi prisoner standing on a box with his head covered , and wires attached to his hands sparked disgust around the world . but for hundreds of torture survivors undergoing therapy at berlin 's center for the treatment of torture victims -lrb- bfzo -rrb- , the graphic photographs have rekindled horrifying memories they have spent years trying to get over . " the photographs flashed on television and in newspapers have awakened sad and shameful memories for many of our patients , " salah ahmad , a therapist at the bfzo told dw-world .
" especially for iraqi patients , the images have triggered memories of the old regime - they are shocked that these things are still happening , " he said . " a 73-year-old patient of ours from kirkuk , iraq , who had witnessed a young boy being forced to strip naked and being beaten while in prison under saddam 's regime , was absolutely traumatized by the photographs - he 's started having the same nightmare over and over again , " added ahmad . many asylum-seekers fleeing torture founded in 1992 , the bfzo treats people from 22 countries .
most of them come from turkey -lrb- mostly kurds -rrb- , iraq , syria , lebanon , the balkans , africa among others .
the majority arrive in germany seeking asylum as they flee political persecution , torture and civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers at the frankfurt airport . according to amnesty international , torture is still practiced in 111 countries in spite of the united nations convention against torture which came into effect in 1987 to abolish torture as a means of organized state violence . germany has signed up to the u.n. convention against torture , which means it is mandatory for it to provide medical and psychological help to the victims of torture . germany currently has 16 centers that offer medical and psychological aid to torture victims .
according to estimates by the working group of psychosocial centers for refugees and torture victims , around 20 percent of refugees who come to germany have been physically or psychologically tortured .
that amounts to around 25,000 people every year . therapy designed to restore dignity of torture victims ahmad says 500 patients were registered at the bfzo last year , around 100 of whom were in intensive therapy for extreme trauma . treatment , which includes medical care , psychiatry , family counseling , art therapy and social work , lasts an average of two to three years and even longer for some .
the aim is not just to treat the physical complaints but also try to give torture victims - who often feel humiliated , disenfranchised and rootless - their dignity back . anni kammerlander , head of the munich-based refugio center , which treats around 1,000 torture victims , including several hundred children , a year , said that many patients who are severely traumatized are often not even aware of their condition . " we often get patients who have no idea what trauma is , they just come and tell us that they get bad headaches or ca n't sleep or feel scared , " she said .
" we first explain to them it 's a normal physical and psychological reaction to a painful experience . " " the whole therapy takes a long time - unil the patients begin to trust you and can openly talk about their torture or rape experience , " kammerlander added . images shameful for iraqis many say the latest public evidence of torture in iraq is a catastrophe for the country . kammerlander said the photographs of iraqi prisoners being made to strip naked before their american captors was an especially shameful and humiliating event in a muslim country where sexuality and baring of skin is still considered taboo . " we do n't even expose ourselves to our close relatives , " haider sabbar , an iraqi prisoner at the abu ghraib prison who was photographed naked by u.s. prison guards , told arabic television channel al jazeera .
" but here -lrb- at abu ghraib -rrb- we were naked in front of american men and women . " need to set up treatment center in iraq therapists agree that the most important thing now is to help the iraqi victims of torture .
" but , there is n't a single group in the country right now that can provide any kind of psychological treatment to them , " ahmad said . he added that the bfzo is involved in talks with various groups and the german ministry for economic cooperation and development in trying to set up a project in iraq , both for the current victims of torture and those who suffered under the old regime .
he admitted , however , that the plans were hobbled by a major lack of funds . " we 've got such advanced methods of treating trauma and torture in the west , we can certainly help them with our know-how , " ahmad said .

no other european port handles as much imports from and exports to china as the one in hamburg .
port officials plan to expand cooperation with chinese ports in the future even further . last year , 1.3 million containers from and to china passed through hamburg 's port , up almost 15 percent from 2002 .
that 's about one sixth of the port 's business , making china the city state 's most important trade partner .
both sides expect double-digit growth rates in the future .
shipping companies are already setting up new systems to deal with demand . as a result , shanghai and hamburg harbors plan to work together more closely in the future , said manfred reuter , who works for hamburg 's economic and labor agency during a recent visit to shanghai . " shanghai port is the world 's third largest container port and has immense growth potential , " reuter told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected shanghai to climb to the top spot relatively soon .
" we believe that our port can also benefit from an exchange of ideas and know-how .
we 're interested in finding out more about the way asian ports are financed . " an employee exchange is one way in which hamburg hopes to benefit from chinese knowledge about port construction and management , reuter said . china 's gateway to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young woman stands in front of shanghai 's skyline .
the city 's port can be seen to the left in the background .
while china mainly exports electronic equipment , clothes and toys via ships , germany sends maschines and car parts across the oceans .
chinese ships usually dock in hamburg , because its location makes it easier to get good to other european destinations than the dutch ports of antwerpen or rotterdam , according to reuter . " china is a highly competitive market for the northern european ports , " reuter said , adding that hamburg has managed to position itself as the winner so far .
" for china , we are the gateway to the emerging markets of central , southern and eastern europe , where many chinese products go . " hamburg and shanghai are sister cities and have been doing business with each other for more than 130 years .
china 's two big shipping companies , cosco and china shipping , have offices in hamburg , as do 320 other companies from the people 's republic . on the other hand , a hamburg port consulting firm is involved in infrastructure planning for a new deep sea port in shanghai that 's currently under construction to deal with rising demand .

today 's international day of families is not a reason to celebrate for everyone : an increasing number of german families are seeking professional advice to cope with problems they face in their daily lives . family counseling centers are not a new phenomenon .
in germany , the first ones opened more than 70 years ago .
the center run by the city of cologne for example has been in business for three quarters of a century .
it 's focus areas and methods have changed significantly over the years . " years ago , we functioned more like a repair shop , " said jürgen zimmermann-höreth , who directs the center in cologne .
" parents or teachers came , ' dropped off ' a child and said : ' now do something and change things . '
today , it 's the family as a whole that 's seeking help .
parents tell us : ' we have a problem that also affects our children . " ' no longer a taboo even fathers , who avoided seeking help in the past , have shown more willingness to visit a center .
but the number of single mothers in need of advice grew at the same time , zimmermann said .
altogether , about 8,300 families came to the cologne center last year . problems span from insecurities about raising children to problems in school and the threat of a family breaking apart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divorce and post-divorce problems have increased significantly , " zimmermann said , adding that visitation rights are often a difficult subject . families seeking help come from all walks of life , according to the expert .
while people were embarrassed to admit their problems in the past , it 's become more acceptable over the years . financial problems top the list apart from divorce , unemployment and financial problems top the list of reasons why people come to see zimmermann and his colleagues . " whether there 's a lot of money or very little , the financial situation is often the biggest reason for fights between parents , " he said .
children 's performance in school is closely related to that since parents themselves feel the pressure to excel in their careers and pass this on to their children , zimmermann added . multicultural families form another group of clients that is on the rise .
about 40 percent of those couples visiting zimmermann come from different cultural backgrounds .

he said he bore moral and political responsibility for a scandal over illegal campaign funds , despite being cleared of direct involvement .
he said revitalising the economy would be top of his agenda .
president roh vowed to co-operate with political opponents who impeached him in parliament in march .
the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says the president 's statement will go down well with the south korean public , who are tired of political in-fighting .
a contrite and subdued president roh addressed the nation in a televised appearance outside his blue house office .
once again i take this opportunity to apologise , deeply apologise , to the people president roh but for all his apparent modesty , our correspondent says , roh moo-hyun has staged a dramatic political comeback , comprehensively turning the tables on his conservative opponents .
" once again , i take this opportunity to apologise , deeply apologise , to the people , " he said .
mr roh apologised for corruption allegations against his aides and the party 's involvement in fundraising abuses during the 2002 election campaign .
' blame me ' but he stopped short of apologising for electoral law violations which led to his impeachment .
" i do n't think i have been freed from moral and political responsibility , " he said .
" especially , the blame for the campaign funds and wrongdoings engulfing those around me should be placed on me . "
the constitutional court ruled that , while mr roh had violated his neutrality as president by backing the liberal uri party which was formed last october , this was insufficient to remove him from office .
it rejected the additional charges of corruption and incompetence .
mr roh 's mandate was in effect renewed with a big vote of confidence in last month 's parliamentary election .
' pragmatist ' some conservatives worry that the liberal president will now show his true ideological colours and be less constrained in his attacks on big business and the alliance with the united states , our correspondent says .
but the president 's allies say he is essentially a pragmatist who understands the need for economic growth and strong ties with washington .
an early test will be over the promised despatch of more than 3,000 troops to iraq .
correspondents say there is growing opposition from the public and from within the ruling party , and the new parliament will be less supportive of the move than the old .

the hitler diaries hoax still makes the blood of journalists freeze but it is far from being the first time that a newspaper has been duped when it should have known better .
perhaps the most humiliating moment in newspaper history came in 1983 when the sunday times followed the lead of german magazine stern and chose to run extracts from the hitler diaries , which were quickly established to be forgeries .
they were the work of konrad kujau , who had based his forgery on a book of hitler 's speeches and proclamations compiled by a nazi federal archivist .
peppered with personal comments such as " must get tickets for the olympic games for eva " and " the little dr goebbels is up to his tricks again with women " , the works still fooled many of those who came in contact with them .
an editorial job is not science ... but they are not infallible , they do make mistakes alan abel legendary hoaxer but soon after publication in germany and britain , tests revealed that the paper , glue and ink were of post-war origin , and the text of the 60 volumes of diaries was full of mistakes and anachronisms .
they had been authenticated by the eminent historian of the nazi era and times newspaper group director , lord dacre .
he said afterwards he had withdrawn his authentication at the last minute , too late to stop publication , and that he felt he had been made a scapegoat .
the damage to his reputation was huge , with the editors involved also profoundly embarrassed , and even sunday times proprietor rupert murdoch was touched by the scandal .
but although there was embarrassment in the hitler diaries case , there was no political impact to match that in perhaps the greatest ever hoax involving a newspaper - the zinoviev letter .
in 1924 , the daily mail published a letter purporting to be from gregori zinoviev , head of the comintern organisation , a part of the soviet political machinery dedicated to international revolution .
labour 's downfall the letter exhorted british communists to spread sedition in the country and its armed forces , and the mail ran headlines like " civil war plot by socialists ' masters " .
a few days later britain went to the polls and the letter was blamed for the labour government 's heavy defeat .
but the letter was a fake , and british labour supporters have blamed a plot by the establishment ever since .
an investigation by foreign office historian gill bennett in 1999 concluded it was faked by anti-bolshevik russian emigres in latvia , angered by labour plans to normalise relations with the soviet union .
but british intelligence agents , long blamed for its creation , may have been responsible for its leaking to daily mail , knowing the damage it could do to the labour government .
lord dacre authenticated the hitler diaries and was humiliated there were clues in the incorrect titles contained in the letter , but the mail , as well as a number of spies , civil servants and even mps , believed in it .
but while this hoax cost a government its grip on power , and the hitler diaries cost many their reputations , all news organisations are the victims of lesser hoaxes on a regular basis .
the sun apologised in 1996 when it ran a front page splash on a video purportedly featuring princess diana and lover james hewitt cavorting .
in fact , the grainy video featured lookalikes .
the mirror exposed its rival 's mistake with a front page headlined " fake " , and said in its editorial : " its editor issued an apology .
but however low he grovels , it wo n't be enough to right this wrong . "
american alan abel , often described as the world 's greatest hoaxer , has persuaded editors to run stories on a host of made-up schemes including a campaign to clothe " lewd naked animals " and a school for professional beggars .
he also tricked the new york times into running his own obituary .
he told bbc news online no editor could be expected to be right all of the time .
" if it 's a good story on a slow news day between axe murderers and killings , and the editors want some levity , they will go for it . "
he said hoaxes , even those that were fraudulent , happened in free countries , but the photos that ended up in the mirror were beyond the pale .
" it is deplorable ...
there are people who are waiting to make a buck .
" if they missed it , if it got by them because there was a deadline and the story was hot and they needed to get it out first ... they may have to go , somebody has to take the fall . "
stringent checks but he added : " an editorial job is not science , they are allowed to make mistakes .
it is a bad , bad mistake , but they are not infallible , they do make mistakes . "
linda christmas , from london 's city university 's journalism course , said she could not recall any hoax on the scale of the faked mirror pictures , and she said its journalists would have carried out the most stringent checks .
the former guardian journalist said both broadsheets and tabloids made mistakes but that the allegations made by the soldiers were strong enough not to require the use of pictures if there was any degree of suspicion .

an editorial job is not science ... but they are not infallible , they do make mistakes alan abel legendary hoaxer but soon after publication in germany and britain , tests revealed that the paper , glue and ink were of post-war origin , and the text of the 60 volumes of diaries was full of mistakes and anachronisms .
they had been authenticated by the eminent historian of the nazi era and times newspaper group director , lord dacre .
he said afterwards he had withdrawn his authentication at the last minute , too late to stop publication , and that he felt he had been made a scapegoat .
the damage to his reputation was huge , with the editors involved also profoundly embarrassed , and even sunday times proprietor rupert murdoch was touched by the scandal .
but although there was embarrassment in the hitler diaries case , there was no political impact to match that in perhaps the greatest ever hoax involving a newspaper - the zinoviev letter .
in 1924 , the daily mail published a letter purporting to be from gregori zinoviev , head of the comintern organisation , a part of the soviet political machinery dedicated to international revolution .
labour 's downfall the letter exhorted british communists to spread sedition in the country and its armed forces , and the mail ran headlines like " civil war plot by socialists ' masters " .
a few days later britain went to the polls and the letter was blamed for the labour government 's heavy defeat .
but the letter was a fake , and british labour supporters have blamed a plot by the establishment ever since .
an investigation by foreign office historian gill bennett in 1999 concluded it was faked by anti-bolshevik russian emigres in latvia , angered by labour plans to normalise relations with the soviet union .
but british intelligence agents , long blamed for its creation , may have been responsible for its leaking to daily mail , knowing the damage it could do to the labour government .
lord dacre authenticated the hitler diaries and was humiliated there were clues in the incorrect titles contained in the letter , but the mail , as well as a number of spies , civil servants and even mps , believed in it .
but while this hoax cost a government its grip on power , and the hitler diaries cost many their reputations , all news organisations are the victims of lesser hoaxes on a regular basis .
the sun apologised in 1996 when it ran a front page splash on a video purportedly featuring princess diana and lover james hewitt cavorting .
in fact , the grainy video featured lookalikes .
the mirror exposed its rival 's mistake with a front page headlined " fake " , and said in its editorial : " its editor issued an apology .
but however low he grovels , it wo n't be enough to right this wrong . "
american alan abel , often described as the world 's greatest hoaxer , has persuaded editors to run stories on a host of made-up schemes including a campaign to clothe " lewd naked animals " and a school for professional beggars .
he also tricked the new york times into running his own obituary .
he told bbc news online no editor could be expected to be right all of the time .
" if it 's a good story on a slow news day between axe murderers and killings , and the editors want some levity , they will go for it . "
he said hoaxes , even those that were fraudulent , happened in free countries , but the photos that ended up in the mirror were beyond the pale .
" it is deplorable ...
there are people who are waiting to make a buck .
" if they missed it , if it got by them because there was a deadline and the story was hot and they needed to get it out first ... they may have to go , somebody has to take the fall . "
stringent checks but he added : " an editorial job is not science , they are allowed to make mistakes .
it is a bad , bad mistake , but they are not infallible , they do make mistakes . "
linda christmas , from london 's city university 's journalism course , said she could not recall any hoax on the scale of the faked mirror pictures , and she said its journalists would have carried out the most stringent checks .
the former guardian journalist said both broadsheets and tabloids made mistakes but that the allegations made by the soldiers were strong enough not to require the use of pictures if there was any degree of suspicion .
" journalists are trained to think around corners , to ask ' where are they taking me ' .

the hitler diaries hoax still makes the blood of journalists freeze but it is far from being the first time that a newspaper has been duped when it should have known better .
perhaps the most humiliating moment in newspaper history came in 1983 when the sunday times followed the lead of german magazine stern and chose to run extracts from the hitler diaries , which were quickly established to be forgeries .
they were the work of konrad kujau , who had based his forgery on a book of hitler 's speeches and proclamations compiled by a nazi federal archivist .
peppered with personal comments such as " must get tickets for the olympic games for eva " and " the little dr goebbels is up to his tricks again with women " , the works still fooled many of those who came in contact with them .
an editorial job is not science ... but they are not infallible , they do make mistakes alan abel legendary hoaxer but soon after publication in germany and britain , tests revealed that the paper , glue and ink were of post-war origin , and the text of the 60 volumes of diaries was full of mistakes and anachronisms .
they had been authenticated by the eminent historian of the nazi era and times newspaper group director , lord dacre .
he said afterwards he had withdrawn his authentication at the last minute , too late to stop publication , and that he felt he had been made a scapegoat .
the damage to his reputation was huge , with the editors involved also profoundly embarrassed , and even sunday times proprietor rupert murdoch was touched by the scandal .
but although there was embarrassment in the hitler diaries case , there was no political impact to match that in perhaps the greatest ever hoax involving a newspaper - the zinoviev letter .
in 1924 , the daily mail published a letter purporting to be from gregori zinoviev , head of the comintern organisation , a part of the soviet political machinery dedicated to international revolution .
labour 's downfall the letter exhorted british communists to spread sedition in the country and its armed forces , and the mail ran headlines like " civil war plot by socialists ' masters " .
a few days later britain went to the polls and the letter was blamed for the labour government 's heavy defeat .
but the letter was a fake , and british labour supporters have blamed a plot by the establishment ever since .
an investigation by foreign office historian gill bennett in 1999 concluded it was faked by anti-bolshevik russian emigres in latvia , angered by labour plans to normalise relations with the soviet union .
but british intelligence agents , long blamed for its creation , may have been responsible for its leaking to daily mail , knowing the damage it could do to the labour government .
lord dacre authenticated the hitler diaries and was humiliated there were clues in the incorrect titles contained in the letter , but the mail , as well as a number of spies , civil servants and even mps , believed in it .
but while this hoax cost a government its grip on power , and the hitler diaries cost many their reputations , all news organisations are the victims of lesser hoaxes on a regular basis .
the sun apologised in 1996 when it ran a front page splash on a video purportedly featuring princess diana and lover james hewitt cavorting .
in fact , the grainy video featured lookalikes .
the mirror exposed its rival 's mistake with a front page headlined " fake " , and said in its editorial : " its editor issued an apology .
but however low he grovels , it wo n't be enough to right this wrong . "
american alan abel , often described as the world 's greatest hoaxer , has persuaded editors to run stories on a host of made-up schemes including a campaign to clothe " lewd naked animals " and a school for professional beggars .
he also tricked the new york times into running his own obituary .
he told bbc news online no editor could be expected to be right all of the time .
" if it 's a good story on a slow news day between axe murderers and killings , and the editors want some levity , they will go for it . "
he said hoaxes , even those that were fraudulent , happened in free countries , but the photos that ended up in the mirror were beyond the pale .

the phantom looks like other game consoles the service combines a " games receiver " , which looks much like a games console , and a subscription which allows games to be downloaded from the internet .
phantom had been ridiculed for its substance-less qualities in the last 18 months as the new company got off the ground without showing any actual hardware .
the company has made light of such stories in its e3 marketing , with slogans " phantom lives " and " i believe " .
downloadable library " it 's a games receiver for pc games , " explained a spokesman for the company .
it comes with a keyboard and mouse " you pay $ 29.95 a month and for that you get the receiver , a lap pad and games pad . "
the receiver is a high-specification pc in a custom-designed box which does not look out of place in a living room .
it comes free only if customers sign up for a two-year subscription - it costs $ 199 without a subscription .
the lap pad is also a clever piece of design , combining a keyboard and mouse which sit combined in your lap .
" trying to play pc games in your living room is hard .
this makes it easy , " said the infinium spokesman .
the service is being compared with subscribing to cable or satellite television .
the package comes with a library of free games and more can be downloaded .
phantom players kevin bachus , president of infinium labs , said : " people my age who grew up playing video games are now starting families of their own and are eager to play together .
early designs looked very different " we 'll have an array of titles .
and all the customer will have to do is sit down in front of the system , choose a title and begin to play . "
phantom has announced deals with chip manufacturer amd to provide the main processor and nvidia to provide the graphics chip .
the receiver has a athlon xp 2500 + cpu , with a 40 gigabyte hard drive and 256 megabytes of ram .
those specifications compare well with pcs available today although it is unclear how the receiver will adapt to the fast changing world of pc gaming .
" we think it will appeal to the hardcore gamer and the casual gamer , " said a spokesman .
the console will also allow for multiplayer games with other phantom owners as well as pc gamers .

key ministers and workers ' representatives had been in talks for several days in an effort to arrive at an agreement .
unions representing affected workers have welcomed the move , calling it a " victory for pensions justice and trade unionism " .
we asked for your comments .
this is what you had to say : i would like to congratulate the government on its proposed compensation scheme for workers robbed of their pension .
it has managed to give almost nothing to almost no-one , with the agreement of the trade unions , and still tried to look good in the process !
spin at its finest .
david skinner , chairman , shipham 's pension action group the government advised people to pay into company pensions .
the compensation should come from the government , not from the pension companies as that would affect the people paying into their own pensions without company help .
legislation should be passed so that the pension contributions do not belong to the company but to the pension fund , which should be held separately from the company .
mrs s p thorne members of final-salary schemes that were wound up but their companies remained solvent lost out in exactly the same way as companies that went into liquidation .
they should also be looked after by the new scheme .
they also lost most of their pensions through no fault of their own !
bernard coonan i had my deferred pension promise of £ 6800 pa wound up by my former employer who is still solvent .
this will not benefit me - and thousands like me - despite the fact that we are basically in the same position s crawford it did this to cut business costs .
as a result , i have lost more than 50 % of my pension .
this political and cynical act by labour to avoid defeat in the commons will not benefit me - and thousands like me - despite the fact that we are basically in the same position .
s crawford the £ 400 million is a knee jerk reaction to stop a backbench revolt over the pension protection fund .
although the details have yet to be made public , it appears that the thousands who are deferred members of solvent employers who closed their schemes leaving massive deficits have been ignored .
dave skinner under the flawed 1995 pensions act it is a legal requirement that my husband 's pension - accumulated over more than 20 years - be taken in its entirety and used to subsidise the pensions of those in his scheme who have already retired , leaving him with nothing whatsoever .
sixty thousand deferred pensioners have been robbed of their pensions , not at gunpoint , but by legislation gillian a macdougal poor performance on the stock market is not only to blame , the government is also responsible .
sixty thousand deferred pensioners - who are also taxpayers - have been robbed of their pensions , not at gunpoint , but by legislation .
they must be compensated by legislation .
gillian a. macdougall i find it confusing why the government has to bail out these pension schemes .
do n't get me wrong , i do not think it is right for these people to lose out , but surely the people operating the schemes should pay ?
should we not be looking at the pensions industry itself , the actuaries and consultants which were employed by the trustees ?
i have a money purchase scheme , which means all the risk is placed on my pension fund .
i find it confusing why the government has to bail out these pension schemes philip if there happens to be a stock market crash when i decide to take my benefits i will end up with next to nothing .
should i expect the government to bail me out if this happens ?
i can not really see any sort of pension scheme where risk is not involved , whether to the company or to its members .
it is like car insurance , some people pay for years and years and never make a claim , when others claim several times .
should i as a careful driver be asking why my insurance premiums have increased when i have never made a claim ?
philip i see these pensioners as worthy of compensation in full .
the proposed scheme is not up to what is required .
its intention is simply to quieten things down for a while .
the £ 400million may sound a lot , but spread over 20 years , it works out at an average of just over £ 6 a week .
if you take out the likely cost to the taxpayer of means-tested pension guarantees for people left with nothing , there probably is no new money involved at all .
michael woodman i was made redundant at 50 years of age , and then had an uncertain future made even worse when i lost 90 % of my promised pension , through no fault of my own when the company went into liquidation .
i was encouraged by successive governments to make provision for my retirement - which i did - and nowhere did it say there was a risk involved in this investment .
it does look as if - through pressure - the cases are starting to be taken seriously ian jones i ask others to try to sympathise with this situation .
i am too old to make up anything like the pension contributions now , so where am i to turn if not to the government ?
this new scheme is a good start , but the details are hazy , and it will be many months before we know who will get anything .
but it does look as if , through pressure , the cases are starting to be taken seriously .
ian jones i was lead by the government , the napf , opas , opra , my employer , trade unions and the media , to believe that my pension was detached from the company , protected by law and guaranteed .
in reality , now my employer has gone bust , i find they all lied .
the private pension scandals of the 1990s slip into insignificance compared with this disaster andrew parr , pensionstheft.org at the age of 60 i find my pension has vanished , and despite full time employment for 40 years i will have to rely on the state .
the state misled us all , the state should pay .
the private pension scandals of the 1990s slip into insignificance compared with this disaster .
andrew parr , pensionstheft.org the taxpayer may be bailing out these people , but nothing to what we pay for those who are unemployed , or are sick , or in prison .
also , is the taxpayer not being asked to cover the £ 400 billion plus black hole that is currently facing the public sector pensions ?
in comparison , the amount for final salary people is a tiny drop in the ocean .
liz kwantes , equitable life members support group my employer is still a functioning , profitable enterprise .
our final salary pension scheme was wound up some years ago and replaced with a money purchase plan .
the final salary fund is presently under funded and our pensions from this source will be a fraction of those promised to us when the scheme was wound up .
the government 's complicity and reluctance to correct the matter really upsets current and future pensioners .
during the 80s and 90s in agreement with , indeed , as guided by , the government , my firm took payment holidays as the pension fund performance was so good .
our action is based on the promises that were made to us by our employer and the inability of the law to enforce this contract chris hulatt i believe this practise was encouraged by the government as this pension money then became profit which of course attracted additional taxation .
we have spent considerable sums of our own money chasing this matter through the ombudsman , trying to gain a ruling to force our firm to make good the damage done by taking these payment holidays .
our action is based on the promises that were made to us by our employer and the inability of the law to enforce this contract .
chris hulatt public money should not have to be used in this way .
but it is a failing of british legislation that company pension funds are not ring-fenced , as fund-members ' property to which the employer has no entitlement .
as a general rule , the employee 's contribution is taken from his nominal salary and the employer undertakes to make contributions on the employee 's behalf .
the money concerned should be set aside for pension purposes only .
the only dispute that should arise is in the event of maladministration by the fund trustees .
the winding-up of the company should in no way lead automatically to the winding-up of the fund .
i see no attempt at the fairly simple legislative reform required to prevent what amounts , morally , to pension theft peter bissmire britain seems to be one of the few countries in which a company can legally set up a pension fund that is not subject to the protections mentioned .
putting it crudely , the company 's creditors have a right to company assets but not to my pension , which is an asset in which the employees -lrb- fund-members -rrb- have a stake , not the company .
while government protection funds are being set up , i see no attempt at the fairly simple legislative reform required to prevent what amounts , morally , to pension theft .
peter bissmire according to ceefax the £ 400m will cover the 60,000 unfortunate pensioners involved , over a period of 20 years .
not , it seems £ 400m a year .
that works out to about £ 333 per year , which seems derisory .
have i misunderstood the whole thing or is this another case of flinging out a figure in millions and expecting no-one to do the necessary calculations ?
anthony craig whilst i have every sympathy for those who have lost their pensions , listening to the man who wants his pension reinstated in full is going too far .
it is not my fault as a tax payer that this has happened , bad management and world economics may have contributed but not me .
am i , as a taxpayer now underwriting every pension scheme in the country ?
this is a slippery road for the taxpayer as it has no bottom to its cost .
