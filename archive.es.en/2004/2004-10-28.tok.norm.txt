the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .

just 24 hours after expressing unwillingness to reshuffle his team , he told the parliament he was backing down and reassembling his team . his move marks a shaky beginning to his presidency and also proves how complex the division of responsibility between brussels , strasbourg and luxembourg is . intended to mark the dawning of a new era for the eu , the new constitution , set to be signed in rome friday , wo n't in fact do anything to alter the precarious balance of power . his detractors say that that barroso underestimated the parliament .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .
it seems that de-hitlerizing britain ’ s history curriculums does n't come cheap . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british and german kids struggle with clichés in berlin on thursday , the british council and the german goethe institute presented a new study which looks at what young people in the uk and germany think about each other ’ s countries .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .
it seems that de-hitlerizing britain ’ s history curriculums does n't come cheap . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british and german kids struggle with clichés in berlin on thursday , the british council and the german goethe institute presented a new study which looks at what young people in the uk and germany think about each other ’ s countries .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 germany 's churches bear a financial cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unconventional measures : helping churches out of financial trouble taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery . while the number of atheists doesn ’ t necessarily increase when economic times get tough , the number of people contributing to church coffers drops .
in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .

in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2004 foreign observers ready to monitor us elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce will scrutinize president bush 's attempt to be reelected on thursday , short-term observers from the osce arrive in the united states .
for the first time ever , a foreign organization will be officially monitoring a us presidential vote . in teams of two , the observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will be deployed across the country .
they will monitor the opening of polling stations , the voting , the counting of ballots and the tabulation of results at all levels .
the osce traditionally observes voting more in ex-soviet states and emerging democracies .
but while the us is a far cry from kazakhstan , the mission 's input is now necessary after a series of balloting problems in florida sowed chaos and confusion in the us presidential race in 2000 .
fears that such chaos could be repeated have been heightened in the run-up to the vote on nov .
2 .
on wednesday , election officials in florida said thousands of absentee ballots which should have been delivered to voters in one of the state 's most populous counties had disappeared .
barbara häring , vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , will oversee the observation mission .
she told deutsche welle that she and the osce were very aware of the responsibility placed on their shoulders .
" the quality of our report will also strengthen our power of argumentation , " said häring .
" this is the only instrument we have at our disposal in order to maintain a clear course in these emotionalized surroundings . "
a political issue on a political level if the election outcome is as tight as it was four years ago , and if mishaps in the counting system also accumulate , the osce mission could come under fire .

in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .

in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .

" jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2004 opinion : barroso 's waterloo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso needs time to reshuffle the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .
resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .
were this to happen , the institutions may find themselves plunged into unprecedented turmoil the democratic process the 732 meps , meanwhile , are visibly proud of themselves for having played such a decisive role in the showdown , even though some might argue that what happened is simply part of the normal european democratic process . the european council might be allowing the parliament its moment of glory , but it will soon make sure everyone remembers that the european union 's supreme legislature is actually the council . a surprise turn-around barroso 's last-minute retreat came as a surprise to many .
just 24 hours after expressing unwillingness to reshuffle his team , he told the parliament he was backing down and reassembling his team . his move marks a shaky beginning to his presidency and also proves how complex the division of responsibility between brussels , strasbourg and luxembourg is . intended to mark the dawning of a new era for the eu , the new constitution , set to be signed in rome friday , wo n't in fact do anything to alter the precarious balance of power . his detractors say that that barroso underestimated the parliament .
after all , it acts according to national interests as much as party political leanings , which makes it an unpredictable body . after facing his nemesis wednesday , barroso may find his unfortunate miscalculation has cost him his reputation as a strong leader . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president in waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited . -lrb- october 28 , 2004 -rrb- barroso withdraws commission incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . -lrb- october 27 , 2004 -rrb- fate of incoming eu commission still uncertain eu commission president prodi indicated friday that his team was prepared for an extension of its term as the crisis over incoming president barroso 's choice of commissioners continued to rage in brussels . -lrb- october 22 , 2004 -rrb- radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .
were this to happen , the institutions may find themselves plunged into unprecedented turmoil the democratic process the 732 meps , meanwhile , are visibly proud of themselves for having played such a decisive role in the showdown , even though some might argue that what happened is simply part of the normal european democratic process . the european council might be allowing the parliament its moment of glory , but it will soon make sure everyone remembers that the european union 's supreme legislature is actually the council . a surprise turn-around barroso 's last-minute retreat came as a surprise to many .
just 24 hours after expressing unwillingness to reshuffle his team , he told the parliament he was backing down and reassembling his team . his move marks a shaky beginning to his presidency and also proves how complex the division of responsibility between brussels , strasbourg and luxembourg is . intended to mark the dawning of a new era for the eu , the new constitution , set to be signed in rome friday , wo n't in fact do anything to alter the precarious balance of power . his detractors say that that barroso underestimated the parliament .

but additional trials on 4,100 more patients were being carried out , meaning the application of us approval of the drug would have to be set back , altana said in a statement .
" it is now expected that the application for approval , originally planned for the first half of 2005 , will take place later , " the statement said .
the announcement marked the second apparent setback in a week for altana 's new potential blockbuster asthma drugs .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

" art cologne " manager oliver p. kuhrt flew in the face of the art world 's customary discretion when he let slip wednesday that the 38th international modern and contemporary cologne art fair is all set to make a turnover of € 60 million -lrb- $ 76 million -rrb- over the next five days .
in contrast , the berlin art forum enjoys a € 10 million -lrb- $ 13 million -rrb- turnover , while sales at london 's frieze art fair reach € 30 million -lrb- $ 38 million -rrb- . hosting some 250 exhibitors from 22 countries and set to attract around 70,000 visitors , art cologne is therefore europe 's most profitable art marketplace this autumn . now that kurth has scuppered any financial doubts the critics might have had , art cologne is also keen to prove that although it might not be the youngest trade fair on the scene , it still has its finger on the pulse . has cologne missed the boat ? but does it ?
cologne gallerist luis campana told dw-world that art cologne has ignored calls to scale down for too long .
" it 's a question of quality , " he said .
" art cologne is n't willing to become smaller and that 's what led the founding of art forum berlin -lrb- in 1995 -rrb- .
it was a reaction to what 's wrong with cologne . " " they 've been sleeping for too long , " campana told the welt am sonntag newspaper . " they 've missed the boat .
there are simply better fairs than art cologne , and now it has a serious problem . " fresh work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist sigmar polke art cologne director gerard goodrow is open to change and has done his best to revamp the fair 's image , inviting scores of international collectors and major galleries , including pace wildenstein and robert miller from new york , and introducing a number of innovations such as shared stands , which juxtapose , for example , georg baselitz and sigmar polke -lrb- photo -rrb- with rare classical antiquities . " we have to improve the fair 's quality , " goodrow told welt am sonntag .
" we need fresh work and we want it to be well presented . " welcoming more international visitors than in previous years , this year 's event is also showcasing more work by younger , contemporary artists , including julia jansen , janice macnab and simon pasieka . commercial pressure nonetheless , goodrow is n't willing to reduce the number of gallerists exhibiting in cologne .
" we have to sell , " he said .
" so we ca n't cut back the number of exhibitors . " alternative art fairs , meanwhile , are gaining in popularity .
this year sees the first " rheinschau " exhibition in cologne taking place at the same time as art cologne .
the focus here is on daring , experimental contemporary art which , organizers say , is not often seen at the bigger art fairs . but fashion aside , rheinschau ca n't begin to compete with art cologne 's commercial clout .
early sales this year included a 1954 willi baumeister painting , bought for € 320,000 -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- , and a piece by gerhard richter for just as much . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .
collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 deep sea sediment might have sparked evolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stellar explosion , like this one , could have changed earth 's climate german scientists , sifting through dust on the ocean 's floor , have discovered stardust that may have helped initiate human evolution . the team of researchers , from the technical university of munich , announced on wednesday that sediment found at the bottom of the pacific ocean could be from a star explosion 2.8 million years ago that may have coincided with massive climate change in the world . about 15,750 feet -lrb- 4,800 meters -rrb- below the surface of the pacific ocean , the scientists found layers of iron-60 .
the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

but while the us is a far cry from kazakhstan , the mission 's input is now necessary after a series of balloting problems in florida sowed chaos and confusion in the us presidential race in 2000 .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .

" jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2004 opinion : barroso 's waterloo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso needs time to reshuffle the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .
resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2004 foreign observers ready to monitor us elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce will scrutinize president bush 's attempt to be reelected on thursday , short-term observers from the osce arrive in the united states .
for the first time ever , a foreign organization will be officially monitoring a us presidential vote . in teams of two , the observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will be deployed across the country .
they will monitor the opening of polling stations , the voting , the counting of ballots and the tabulation of results at all levels .
the osce traditionally observes voting more in ex-soviet states and emerging democracies .
but while the us is a far cry from kazakhstan , the mission 's input is now necessary after a series of balloting problems in florida sowed chaos and confusion in the us presidential race in 2000 .
fears that such chaos could be repeated have been heightened in the run-up to the vote on nov .
2 .
on wednesday , election officials in florida said thousands of absentee ballots which should have been delivered to voters in one of the state 's most populous counties had disappeared .
barbara häring , vice president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , will oversee the observation mission .
she told deutsche welle that she and the osce were very aware of the responsibility placed on their shoulders .
" the quality of our report will also strengthen our power of argumentation , " said häring .
" this is the only instrument we have at our disposal in order to maintain a clear course in these emotionalized surroundings . "
a political issue on a political level if the election outcome is as tight as it was four years ago , and if mishaps in the counting system also accumulate , the osce mission could come under fire .
it could either become a possible witness for the prosecution or a possible protection shield .
after all , the mission , as opposed to other international observers , is there on official invitation from the us state department .
the swiss parliamentarian häring said that the observer mission would not only focus on us " problem states " during polling on nov .
2 .
" we certainly will be in florida and ohio , but also some states where everything will be without problems , because our duty is to give a full picture , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce is the largest regional security organization in the world although the us state department invited the osce , a 55-nation body covering europe , the former soviet union and north america , the issue was hotly debated in the us congress .
" i believe they are quite used to having observers , " said häring .
" it 's just now it has another dimension because it 's a political issue and it 's on a political level . "
keeping a cool head despite the immense pressure on her mission , häring remains composed .
the osce works with clear criteria and it has a clear task in the united states , she said .
" we will not be influencing the current voting , " she said .
" in this sense , we are at best a preventative guarantee that processing occurs correctly .
if we do determine flaws in our observations , then we will report this and make suggestions for elections in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new touchscreen electronic voting machines are supposed to ensure a fair vote while americans go to the polls , the osce will make no statements about whether mishaps , punch-cards or electronic voting equipment -lrb- photo -rrb- could influence the election outcome .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2004 opinion : barroso 's waterloo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso needs time to reshuffle the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .
resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .
were this to happen , the institutions may find themselves plunged into unprecedented turmoil the democratic process the 732 meps , meanwhile , are visibly proud of themselves for having played such a decisive role in the showdown , even though some might argue that what happened is simply part of the normal european democratic process . the european council might be allowing the parliament its moment of glory , but it will soon make sure everyone remembers that the european union 's supreme legislature is actually the council . a surprise turn-around barroso 's last-minute retreat came as a surprise to many .
just 24 hours after expressing unwillingness to reshuffle his team , he told the parliament he was backing down and reassembling his team . his move marks a shaky beginning to his presidency and also proves how complex the division of responsibility between brussels , strasbourg and luxembourg is . intended to mark the dawning of a new era for the eu , the new constitution , set to be signed in rome friday , wo n't in fact do anything to alter the precarious balance of power . his detractors say that that barroso underestimated the parliament .
after all , it acts according to national interests as much as party political leanings , which makes it an unpredictable body . after facing his nemesis wednesday , barroso may find his unfortunate miscalculation has cost him his reputation as a strong leader . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president in waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited . -lrb- october 28 , 2004 -rrb- barroso withdraws commission incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . -lrb- october 27 , 2004 -rrb- fate of incoming eu commission still uncertain eu commission president prodi indicated friday that his team was prepared for an extension of its term as the crisis over incoming president barroso 's choice of commissioners continued to rage in brussels . -lrb- october 22 , 2004 -rrb- feedback has jose barroso been weakened by the debacle ?

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .
it seems that de-hitlerizing britain ’ s history curriculums does n't come cheap . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british and german kids struggle with clichés in berlin on thursday , the british council and the german goethe institute presented a new study which looks at what young people in the uk and germany think about each other ’ s countries .

exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions . " what we do n't need is a conflict between the european institutions .
that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .
his ties with the vatican are such that he is considered a close friend and advisor of pope john paul ii and has even written a book about the pontiff . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : barroso 's waterloo the new eu commission wo n't be taking office next week as planned .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .
were this to happen , the institutions may find themselves plunged into unprecedented turmoil the democratic process the 732 meps , meanwhile , are visibly proud of themselves for having played such a decisive role in the showdown , even though some might argue that what happened is simply part of the normal european democratic process . the european council might be allowing the parliament its moment of glory , but it will soon make sure everyone remembers that the european union 's supreme legislature is actually the council . a surprise turn-around barroso 's last-minute retreat came as a surprise to many .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .
were this to happen , the institutions may find themselves plunged into unprecedented turmoil the democratic process the 732 meps , meanwhile , are visibly proud of themselves for having played such a decisive role in the showdown , even though some might argue that what happened is simply part of the normal european democratic process . the european council might be allowing the parliament its moment of glory , but it will soon make sure everyone remembers that the european union 's supreme legislature is actually the council . a surprise turn-around barroso 's last-minute retreat came as a surprise to many .
just 24 hours after expressing unwillingness to reshuffle his team , he told the parliament he was backing down and reassembling his team . his move marks a shaky beginning to his presidency and also proves how complex the division of responsibility between brussels , strasbourg and luxembourg is . intended to mark the dawning of a new era for the eu , the new constitution , set to be signed in rome friday , wo n't in fact do anything to alter the precarious balance of power . his detractors say that that barroso underestimated the parliament .
after all , it acts according to national interests as much as party political leanings , which makes it an unpredictable body . after facing his nemesis wednesday , barroso may find his unfortunate miscalculation has cost him his reputation as a strong leader . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president in waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited . -lrb- october 28 , 2004 -rrb- barroso withdraws commission incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . -lrb- october 27 , 2004 -rrb- fate of incoming eu commission still uncertain eu commission president prodi indicated friday that his team was prepared for an extension of its term as the crisis over incoming president barroso 's choice of commissioners continued to rage in brussels . -lrb- october 22 , 2004 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .

his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .

" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .

" art cologne " manager oliver p. kuhrt flew in the face of the art world 's customary discretion when he let slip wednesday that the 38th international modern and contemporary cologne art fair is all set to make a turnover of € 60 million -lrb- $ 76 million -rrb- over the next five days .
in contrast , the berlin art forum enjoys a € 10 million -lrb- $ 13 million -rrb- turnover , while sales at london 's frieze art fair reach € 30 million -lrb- $ 38 million -rrb- . hosting some 250 exhibitors from 22 countries and set to attract around 70,000 visitors , art cologne is therefore europe 's most profitable art marketplace this autumn . now that kurth has scuppered any financial doubts the critics might have had , art cologne is also keen to prove that although it might not be the youngest trade fair on the scene , it still has its finger on the pulse . has cologne missed the boat ? but does it ?
cologne gallerist luis campana told dw-world that art cologne has ignored calls to scale down for too long .
" it 's a question of quality , " he said .
" art cologne is n't willing to become smaller and that 's what led the founding of art forum berlin -lrb- in 1995 -rrb- .
it was a reaction to what 's wrong with cologne . " " they 've been sleeping for too long , " campana told the welt am sonntag newspaper . " they 've missed the boat .
there are simply better fairs than art cologne , and now it has a serious problem . " fresh work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist sigmar polke art cologne director gerard goodrow is open to change and has done his best to revamp the fair 's image , inviting scores of international collectors and major galleries , including pace wildenstein and robert miller from new york , and introducing a number of innovations such as shared stands , which juxtapose , for example , georg baselitz and sigmar polke -lrb- photo -rrb- with rare classical antiquities . " we have to improve the fair 's quality , " goodrow told welt am sonntag .
" we need fresh work and we want it to be well presented . " welcoming more international visitors than in previous years , this year 's event is also showcasing more work by younger , contemporary artists , including julia jansen , janice macnab and simon pasieka . commercial pressure nonetheless , goodrow is n't willing to reduce the number of gallerists exhibiting in cologne .
" we have to sell , " he said .
" so we ca n't cut back the number of exhibitors . " alternative art fairs , meanwhile , are gaining in popularity .
this year sees the first " rheinschau " exhibition in cologne taking place at the same time as art cologne .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 germany 's churches bear a financial cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unconventional measures : helping churches out of financial trouble taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery . while the number of atheists doesn ’ t necessarily increase when economic times get tough , the number of people contributing to church coffers drops .
in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .
up to four further commissioners also lack parliamentary support , including hungarian socialist laszlo kovacs -lrb- energy -rrb- and dutch liberal neelie kroes -lrb- competition -rrb- . if barroso decides to send them packing , he will have to ask their governments to put forward new nominees . it may still be too early to speak of a crisis within the institutions , but in fact , the 25-nation bloc may now see barroso himself as part of the problem , a president-elect who has failed to act consistently .

just 24 hours after expressing unwillingness to reshuffle his team , he told the parliament he was backing down and reassembling his team . his move marks a shaky beginning to his presidency and also proves how complex the division of responsibility between brussels , strasbourg and luxembourg is . intended to mark the dawning of a new era for the eu , the new constitution , set to be signed in rome friday , wo n't in fact do anything to alter the precarious balance of power . his detractors say that that barroso underestimated the parliament .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .
he may be the man directly in the line of fire , but it 's up to individual governments to propose acceptable candidates . top eu figures have now warned that barroso will have to do more than replace rocco buttiglione , the italian nominee for justice chief whose conservative roman catholic views caused the fuss in the first place .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 germany 's churches bear a financial cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unconventional measures : helping churches out of financial trouble taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery . while the number of atheists doesn ’ t necessarily increase when economic times get tough , the number of people contributing to church coffers drops .
in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .

but while the us is a far cry from kazakhstan , the mission 's input is now necessary after a series of balloting problems in florida sowed chaos and confusion in the us presidential race in 2000 .
fears that such chaos could be repeated have been heightened in the run-up to the vote on nov .

on wednesday , election officials in florida said thousands of absentee ballots which should have been delivered to voters in one of the state 's most populous counties had disappeared .

a political issue on a political level if the election outcome is as tight as it was four years ago , and if mishaps in the counting system also accumulate , the osce mission could come under fire .

the osce works with clear criteria and it has a clear task in the united states , she said .
" we will not be influencing the current voting , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 germany 's churches bear a financial cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unconventional measures : helping churches out of financial trouble taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery . while the number of atheists doesn ’ t necessarily increase when economic times get tough , the number of people contributing to church coffers drops .
in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .
" sponsorship for productions is hard to get which is why i came up with the idea to ' air ' adverts before performances . "
a theatrical twist but he does n't want to simply put up a video screen and show the run-of-the-mill advertising fodder one sees on tv .
his vision is to have live actors go up on stage and use their thespian talents to enact mini dramas that also just so happen to be plugging a product .
" the dialogues could be as exciting as shakespeare or chekhov .
and it could even be possible to have updates each week , " he said .
the theater plans to run its playhouse promotions three evenings a week , either before or after the play , so they wo n't have to interrupt the performance itself .
wedel said he is willing to direct the ads , if asked , but added that businesses could pick the actors they wanted themselves and produce their own spots if they want creative control .
he 's also relaxed about what companies try to sell .
" anything goes , " he said .
how the public responds to ads is anyone 's guess .
there is one distinct disadvantage for theater-goers faced with the new staged ads - they ca n't use the remote to zap to a different channel until the program comes back on . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police open probe against obscene play police in hamburg are investigating a spanish theater group for displays of pornographic sex and bestiality in a controversial play which premiered in the city last week .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .

british and german kids struggle with clichés traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .

exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 germany 's churches bear a financial cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unconventional measures : helping churches out of financial trouble taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery . while the number of atheists doesn ’ t necessarily increase when economic times get tough , the number of people contributing to church coffers drops .
in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .
several dioceses admit they 're facing a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 germany 's churches bear a financial cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unconventional measures : helping churches out of financial trouble taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery . while the number of atheists doesn ’ t necessarily increase when economic times get tough , the number of people contributing to church coffers drops .
in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .

" there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " jose barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . barroso , whose new eu executive was due to take office on monday , conceded he could not persuade the european parliament to accept a line-up that included his appointment as justice chief of rome 's candidate for the european commission rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who unleashed a storm of controversy when he expressed highly conservative views on gays and women . a " wise " move " barroso 's decision is a wise one and aims to avert a confrontation which could have degenerated into conflict , " italy 's foreign minister franco frattini told the senate .
" the observations and criticism expressed democratically by european parliamentarians against more than just one of the designated commissioners are fully legitimate , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi could n't convince buttiglione to give way .
frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .

that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes . " schöder 's coalition partners , meanwhile , welcomed barroso 's climbdown , with green party leaders claudia roth and reinhard bütikofer as well as the liberal fdp hailing a " good day for european democracy . " in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .

it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .

frattini also stressed his government had full confidence in barroso .
" the italian government has full confidence and reiterates its full confidence in the president-designate of the european commission , mr. barroso , " he added . trouble at the institutions ? back in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters wednesday he was concerned the controversy was symptomatic of trouble at the european institutions .

that would be a major step backwards , " he said , adding " we need cooperation between the european institutions rather than conflicts , whatever the causes .

" in brussels , the head of the liberals in the eu parliament - seen as the kingmakers in any new vote on a new commission line-up - nuanced his group 's view of buttiglione . " the position of my group was to vote against mr. buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner , but in favor of mr. buttiglione as commissioner , " graham watson a briton who leads the 88-strong liberal group told reporters .
" however , to be honest , i think it would be at least politically unwise for mr. barroso to come back with a commission with mr. buttiglione in it , " he added . buttiglione still a candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz german member of the european parliament martin schulz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads the 200-strong socialist group in the 731 member parliament , said that barroso would never have a majority as long as he kept buttiglione . technically barroso can reshuffle his proposed commission to give buttiglione another job but he can not fire him , as the 25-member states each nominate their commissioner .
it would be up to buttiglione to resign to break the possible deadlock . the straight-talking 56-year-old is a catholic conservative with positions close to the vatican on abortion and artificial insemination .

resistance from the european parliament prompted president jose barroso to withdraw his proposal for a new executive .
are the institutions in turmoil ? incoming european commission chief jose barroso is expected to make sweeping changes to his team after withdrawing his first line-up wednesday to avoid a humiliating european parliament defeat . the european parliament appears to have emerged from its extraordinary stand-off with the european commission the clear winner .
often described as a costly and ineffectual paper tiger , the eu legislature came into its own when faced with the new commission team . when barroso succumbed to pressure from the parliament just hours before the vote on the new commission , the 732-seat legislature proved that it still has muscles to flex . better luck next time ? it will be interesting to see whether jose barroso has better luck next time .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

hamburg 's kammerspiele theater plans on taking a page from madison avenue to fill its empty coffers by offering commercials before and after performances .
live actors will hawk products from soap to blenders . starting in february , theater-goers settling in for a performance of a play by goethe , schiller or brecht at the kammerspiele theater will have to first sit through a series of live-action ads , aimed to get them to buy that new washing machine , chocolate or deodorant .
purists might scream that crass commercialism is invading the rarified world of the theater , but the kammerspiele 's director , dieter wedel , says he 's just facing reality .
his theater needs cash , and ads are one way to get it .
" we have to earn around half of our budget ourselves , " he said .

dw-world : british and german kids struggle with clichés dw-world : traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding germany -pipe- 28.10.2004 just do n't mention the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long out of fashion in germany ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem . while in london last week to finalize details of queen elizabeth ’ s upcoming state visit to his country , german foreign minister joschka fischer sounded an alarm over the state of german-british relations .
speaking to bbc radio show " the today program , " fischer said relations were excellent on an official level , but on a person-to-person level things were in a terrible state - and getting worse .
he blamed the british media for perpetuating antiquated images of germans . " my children are 20 and 25 .
when they watch germany in some of the british media , they think this is a picture they have never seen in their whole lifetimes , " fischer said . he added : " if you want to learn how the traditional prussian goose-step works , you have to watch british tv , because in germany , in the younger generation - even in my generation - nobody knows how to perform it . " british press offers explanations fischer 's comments prompted a wave of articles in the british press , many giving credence to his claims and attempting to explain why brits cling to outdated stereotypes .
like fischer , many british columnists took aim at the media and at history teachers , who they claimed all too often favor the shock-inspiring wwii-era chapter in german history over more recent events . some even hinted at a more insidious motive .
“ the root problem is not the media so much as an ingrained tendency , even - perhaps especially - among young britons , to affirm their national identity by crowing about old victories and doing a defeated enemy down .
do we really have nothing better , nothing more recent to feel good about ? ” one journalist wrote in an editorial that appeared in the independent . reason for alarm ? there is undoubtedly an element of truth to such allegations , ulrich sacker , the director of the goethe institute in berlin , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and his british colleague , jack straw , during a 2003 meeting however , unlike fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s necessary to sound an alarm .
“ i wouldn ’ t call it a crisis , ” he said .
“ it ’ s an ongoing debate , but it doesn ’ t help to declare a state of emergency .
that only gives a media platform to those who want to restart the discussion .
it ’ s the same with prejudices : the more you talk about them , the less you achieve . ” instead , sacker and many of his colleges at german cultural and educational institutions are opting for a less heavy-handed approach .
rather than taking on the stereotypes directly - as fischer did - they are coming-up with increasingly innovative , slick , and media savvy initiatives . war off limits nina lemmens , the director of the london office of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is one of the originators of such an approach .
following the success of the daad ’ s “ learn german ” campaign , which featured catchy slogans making light of german stereotypes , she is now looking ahead to the launch of an essay contest for british university students in two weeks called “ but don ’ t mention the war . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedian john cleese in a 1987 photo undergraduates at uk universities will be invited to share their personal experiences of germany and things german as long as they “ don ’ t mention the war . ”
lemmens has even lobbied for the support of john cleese -lrb- photo -rrb- , the originator of the infamous goose-stepping german parody featured on the british comedy " fawlty towers . " " i 'm delighted to help with trying to break down the ridiculous anti-german prejudices of the tabloids , and clowns like basil fawlty , who are pathetically stuck in a world view that 's more than half a century out of date , " cleese said in a statement released by the daad . no substitute for youth exchanges however effective taking on stereotypes with innovative and humorous campaigns may prove , they are no substitute for good-old-fashioned exchange programs , say some experts . uta pätzig , the program director of voyage , an online british-german youth portal funded by the british council and the goethe institute , is one of them .
as part of her job , she has worked with british students en-route to germany on cultural exchanges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is n't just lederhosen “ when we send young people over there , the kinds of preconceptions some of them have are astonishing , ” she told dw-world .
“ sending them there is the only way they can overcome them .
they come back with a much more positive - and better informed - impression . ” reviewing progress during the queen ’ s visit to germany in november , both british and german officials are expected to announce a review of youth exchange programs with an eye towards increasing their efficacy and looking for areas where additional resources may be needed . it remains to be seen whether the british and german governments will eventually launch something akin to the french-german youth office , a multimillion euro government-sponsored program that has been promoting exchanges between french and german youth since the 1960s . in the meantime , the german embassy in london has come-up with an unusual twist on the exchange idea .
twenty english history teachers were invited for an all-expense paid six-day trip to germany - including a stay at a five-star hotel in berlin - in the hopes of giving them a positive impression of the country to incorporate into their lesson plans .
having arrived in berlin on monday , they will also visit dresden and bonn . the total cost of the project comes to a whopping € 52,000 -lrb- $ 66,581 -rrb- .
it seems that de-hitlerizing britain ’ s history curriculums does n't come cheap . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : british and german kids struggle with clichés in berlin on thursday , the british council and the german goethe institute presented a new study which looks at what young people in the uk and germany think about each other ’ s countries .
the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands .

in germany , the catholic and protestant churches rely on taxpayers contributions to keep them afloat . in 2000 , they received a total of € 8.8 billion -lrb- $ 11.1 billion -rrb- in " church tax " revenues , that is 9 percent of the income tax that germans pay the state .
but that was before the recession , and now churches are facing hard times .
income from church tax , which was € 8.5 billion in 2003 , has been dropping steadily for three years and officials expect the trend to continue . " the church 's decreasing income and increasing expenses have led to a clear deficit , " cologne 's archbishop joachim cardinal meisner told church members in early october . fewer germans in the pews the church tax revenues are funneled to the religion to which the taxpayer belongs , though not every religious denomination has applied or gotten approval to collect the funds .
with about 26 million members each , the lion 's share of the money goes to the catholic and protestant churches .
together their parishioners make up just under 64 percent of germany 's population .
however , just one-third of catholics and one-fourth of protestants pay church tax , while children , pensioners , low-earners and the unemployed are exempt . “ financially , it is a tense situation , ” matthis oelke , a spokesman for the state of saxony ’ s protestant churches , told dw-world .
“ we need to find ways to make changes to the church structure without jeopardizing the services we offer the congregation . ” religious congregations around germany are getting smaller and smaller .
even though weddings , funerals and baptisms and other religious ceremonies can only be performed in churches if those involved are tax-paying members , 432,000 germans took their names off church registers between 2001 and 2002 . topping off collection baskets dwindling funds mean church officials are looking for new ways to make money .
the catholic church estimates that every third church in eastern germany needs to be renovated - and many of them suffer from structural damages that need more than bake sales and car washes to pay for renovations . more and more churches are hiding cell phone towers in their spires and selling advertising space on scaffolding as ways to help fill the collection basket .
but sometimes their efforts are n't enough . concerts keep churches open in 2003 , germany 's catholic church published a list of alternatives for churches caught in financial difficulties .
offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .

offering a place for concerts and other non-religious events , moving religious ceremonies to other churches to save on expenses and selling the church to secular organizations or individuals were all ways to keep churches from being torn down . " the sale of a church can only be the very last possibility , " according to dominik schwaderlapp , the cologne archbishop 's general vicar , in a press release published on the church 's web site . even when churches need to be closed for financial reasons , officials would rather see a church turned into an architect ’ s office that keeps the spire standing - as happened to the church of the three kings in the cologne suburb of rondorf - instead of a parking lot , which was the fate of berlin ’ s martin luther church . are churches really poor ? investors have good reason to take a look at holy ground .
whether massive metropolitan cathedrals or village chapels , some 35,000 church spires rise above german towns , and the buildings cover some 6.8 billion square meters -lrb- 73.2 billion square feet -rrb- of land , parts of which sit in highly profitable city centers . the churches could sell € 150 billion worth of real estate if they wanted to , according to carsten frerk , author of " the finances and fortunes of the churches in germany . " he estimated that the churches - which are extremely adverse to allow glimpses into their books - have a total of between € 350 billion and € 500 billion in assets , much of which , however , lies in impossible to sell cathedrals and art treasures . church lay-offs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches of all sizes are funded by church tax though it 's unthinkable that the catholic church would sell the cologne cathedral or that protestants would agree to closing the wittenberg castle church where martin luther set off the reformation , both the catholic and protestant churches , which with 1.3 million people working for them are germany 's largest non-state employers , are following the footsteps of large german companies and letting go of staff to save money . " it ’ s never an easy situation when people are let go , but there is no alternative , " stefan förner , a spokesman for berlin ’ s catholic archbishopric told dw-world .
" we have to do it to be able to continue our work at all . " in a similar situation , the catholic diocese in the western city of aachen announced its plan to save € 60 million by 2008 would eliminate 370 of its 1,162 positions , with 150 of the cuts coming before the end of 2004 . after the german ministry for labor and economics on monday lowered its 2005 growth forecast , saying a prayer and lighting a candle might be all that 's left for the churches ' recently unemployed . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : catholic church in financial crisis germany 's economic slowdown and resulting cost-cutting measures are reaching all parts of society , including the catholic church .

the version of iron is very unusual in that it takes a lot of heat and pressure to make it , the kind of heat and pressure only a supernova can deliver . the researchers theorized that a star explosion close to earth was the only explanation for the sediment 's location on the bottom of the ocean .
they said the layer indicated the star exploded 2.8 million years ago , showering down iron and cosmic rays . fleeing the trees , becoming human working on previous evidence that cosmic ray bombardment could have opened up the ozone layer , the researchers said the supernova could have cooked up the earth in such a way as to force climate change . anthropologists believe that climate change led to deforestation , forcing hominids to climb down from the trees and walk erect . " the african climate shifted towards more arid conditions about 2.8 million years ago , " the researchers , led by gunther korschinek , wrote .
" some of the major events in early hominid evolution appear to be coeval with african climate changes . " the discovery comes five years after korschinek led the team that first discovered iron-60 sediment in a more shallow area of the pacific ocean .
scientists said at the time that the sediment was deposited on earth at the same time as the planet was undergoing " mini-extinctions , " where species die out at a higher rate than normal . in a paper published in the new astronomy journal , brian fields and john ellis wrote that the team 's discovery would " constitute the first direct evidence that a supernova occurred near earth in the fairly recent geologic past , with detectable effects on our planet .

owners interbrew decided to shut the strangeways brewery last month to reduce distribution costs .
the 10-strong group , from the transport and general workers ' union -lrb- t & g -rrb- will meet members of the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- in brussels on thursday .
spokesman franny joyce said the meeting was another step in the " save the cream " campaign .
" this is another way in which we are showing that the brewery workers and the people of manchester are not going to go away , " he said .
" interbrew are in denial about what we are saying so we 'll be shouting it loud and clear to them .
profits are up , growth is up and efficiency is up .
this is a profitable brewery . "
interbrew is planning to keep its cask ale production in manchester after the closure - moving it to hydes brewery , moss side - but the majority of production work will be moving to lancashire , scotland and wales .
philip malpass , of interbrew 's parent company inbev , said the closure was down to a trend of more people choosing to drink lager than ale .
the delegation will visit colleagues from the european federation of food agriculture and tourism trade union -lrb- effat -rrb- , before lobbying for support at inbev 's major brewery in leuven .
they will later visit the company 's distribution depot at armentières in france .

the 50 london hooligans hired a coach and travelled 115 miles to spark a mass brawl before cardiff 's coca-cola cup tie on tuesday night .
police are now studying cctv footage ahead of the league match in cardiff with west ham next tuesday .
dorset police made four arrests .
a cardiff fan in his mid 20s suffered a broken jaw after being struck by a brick and needed hospital treatment .
a second bluebirds ' fan was treated for facial injuries .
police said that the london hooligans posed as ordinary customers at the queens park pub close to bournemouth 's stadium .
it was absolute chaos with people with blood down their faces pub barman but on cue , they launched into a rendition of i 'm forever blowing bubbles , west ham 's trademark song , and started fighting .
the brawl spilled outside and , after a wall was demolished , bricks were thrown .
a dozen police officers who were on patrol outside the pub managed to control the trouble and made four arrests .
inspector martin webster of dorset said tuesday night 's trouble had been well-organised on the part of west ham hooligans .
he said the men were dressed in designer clothing .
insp webster said : " normally with these sort of things we get some sort of prior warning from a network of football intelligence-led police officers .
" but we received no information even though it appeared to be very well organised on the part of the fans from london .
" they hired a coach specifically to drive them from london to bournemouth .
they liaised with each other beforehand as they were not wearing their teams ' colours .
" it appears the cardiff supporters did not arrange to meet them .
" they came here to have a few drinks and then watch the football .
on the whole they were well behaved .
" but at around 7pm between 35 and 50 people got off the coach and went to the queens park pub . "
a barman at the pub said : " a coach load from london pulled up and came in and started mingling and acting as normal punters .
" then a few minutes later they started singing i 'm forever blowing bubbles , and with that all hell broke loose .
" it was absolute chaos with people with blood down their faces .
it spilled outside and the fighting carried on . "
' absolute chaos ' four coach loads of cardiff fans and other supporters in cars had travelled down for the game , including children on half term holidays .
gwyn davies of the valleys rams supporters ' club said there was " pandemonium " in the pub .

the photos , dating from the early twentieth century and on glass plate negatives , were found in a storeroom clear-out at newtown high school .
the photographer , john bancroft willans , was a well-travelled land owner in montgomeryshire .
there are plans to donate the pictures to the national library of wales in aberystwyth . "
these photographs have been a great find " historian david pugh the negatives were given to newtown high school 's predecessor , newtown county intermediate school , more than 60 years ago .
local historian david pugh is attempting to identify the 800 negatives .
he said : " the geography teacher was clearing out the storeroom and he came across boxes of negatives - around 800 pictures .
" the first thing i did was scan them in and try to identify them , although there 's still a lot of work to do and i 'm about half way through at the moment . "
john bancroft willans was the owner of the dolforgan estate in kerry and many of the photographs depict his life as an edwardian gentleman .
in the pictures , he recorded family tea parties in the garden at the estate and took pictures of farms and buildings on his land .
mr willans was commissioned by the powys land club to photograph churches and other buildings in mid wales .
he used around 80 of these to illustrate a book , the byways of montgomeryshire , which was published in 1905 , but the rest of the 800 pictures discovered in newtown high school have had to be identified individually .
mr pugh said : " willans was a typical edwardian gentleman and he took many pictures of his estate and of local workers .
" the third element is pictures he took of local buildings - many of which have now gone .
" he also took many pictures of his travels to virtually every country in europe and these pictures are proving the most difficult to identify .
" he visited three or four european countries every year from 1904 .
" when he died in 1957 , his diaries were left to the national library .
" they are very detailed , so i am able to use those to match up where he was with the pictures themselves . "
mr pugh said most of the 800 photographs dated from the first decade of the twentieth century and were important in documenting the history of mid wales .
he added : " i 've seen nothing like this recorded from that era .
" there was a professional photographer in the area at that time called john owen , but most of his negatives have been lost .
" these photographs have been a great find . "
bob davey , a governor at newtown high school , said : " even though they are viewed from a historical sense now , they -lrb- the photographs -rrb- were originally used during geography lessons .
" john bancroft willans was very friendly with eg lewis , a former geography teacher and head teacher at the school .
" he also donated his library collection to the school . "

the photos , dating from the early twentieth century and on glass plate negatives , were found in a storeroom clear-out at newtown high school .
the photographer , john bancroft willans , was a well-travelled land owner in montgomeryshire .
there are plans to donate the pictures to the national library of wales in aberystwyth .
these photographs have been a great find historian david pugh the negatives were given to newtown high school 's predecessor , newtown county intermediate school , more than 60 years ago .
local historian david pugh is attempting to identify the 800 negatives .
he said : " the geography teacher was clearing out the storeroom and he came across boxes of negatives - around 800 pictures .
" the first thing i did was scan them in and try to identify them , although there 's still a lot of work to do and i 'm about half way through at the moment . "
john bancroft willans was the owner of the dolforgan estate in kerry and many of the photographs depict his life as an edwardian gentleman .
willans pictured working life in mid wales in the pictures , he recorded family tea parties in the garden at the estate and took pictures of farms and buildings on his land .
mr willans was commissioned by the powys land club to photograph churches and other buildings in mid wales .
he used around 80 of these to illustrate a book , the byways of montgomeryshire , which was published in 1905 , but the rest of the 800 pictures discovered in newtown high school have had to be identified individually .
mr pugh said : " willans was a typical edwardian gentleman and he took many pictures of his estate and of local workers .
" the third element is pictures he took of local buildings - many of which have now gone .
willans ' travels in europe make up many of the photographs " he also took many pictures of his travels to virtually every country in europe and these pictures are proving the most difficult to identify .
" he visited three or four european countries every year from 1904 .
" when he died in 1957 , his diaries were left to the national library .
" they are very detailed , so i am able to use those to match up where he was with the pictures themselves . "
mr pugh said most of the 800 photographs dated from the first decade of the twentieth century and were important in documenting the history of mid wales .
he added : " i 've seen nothing like this recorded from that era .

but how do modern stars match up to the original line-up of 1984 ?
george michael the wham ! singer was one of the biggest stars at the time of band aid , after the duo had huge global hits that year with wake me up before you go go and freedom .
michael also had his first solo success with careless whisper .
wham ! would have had the uk christmas number one too with last christmas - their biggest-selling single - had band aid not been released .
although only a duo , wham ! 's style set the trend for future boy bands , and michael continued to have huge solo success - unlike his partner andrew ridgley .
robbie williams everyone expected williams to be the andrew ridgley rather than the george michael of take that after the most popular british boy band of the 1990s split up .
but williams ' boy band days are now behind him and he has gone on to be the most successful uk music star for the best part of a decade .
like michael , he achieved that with a mixture of ballads and upbeat dancefloor-friendly songs - although he has never matched michael 's us success .
his last album , escapology , has sold six million copies worldwide - but only 130,000 of those came in the us .
bono by 1984 , u2 had been going for eight years and just had their biggest hit with pride -lrb- in the name of love -rrb- .
many u2 songs had political messages but lead singer bono 's global campaigning really started after band aid , and he has become a forceful voice on aids and global debt .
they were one of the biggest new rock bands around and , with the smiths , provided a more credible alternative to the prevalent pop acts of the day .
but bono also had one of the worst mullet hairstyles of the 1980s - which is saying something .
he is expected to join the line-up again this time .
chris martin coldplay are at a similar stage in their careers as u2 were in 1984 , and frontman chris martin even had a silly hairstyle in their early days .
coldplay 's music is similarly grand , although they have been accused of being too effete and making " music for bedwetters " .
but they have enjoyed success on both sides of the atlantic , winning the record of the year at the grammys this year .
martin is leading the current crop of rock stars with a conscience , campaigning for fair global trade .
status quo masters of the 12-bar boogie , status quo were veterans of the british rock scene even in 1984 , after 15 years in the business .
but they were still enjoying regular top 10 hits at the time of band aid , with a style that may not have been very complex or deep , but was certainly popular .
they opened live aid the following year and have sold more than 100 million albums , despite being banned by radio 1 in 1995 .
the darkness the uk 's latest heavy rock gods do not have as much mileage behind them as the quo , but the bands share a love of a no-nonsense guitar riff .
the darkness shot to fame in 2003 and won three brit awards in february 2004 , cementing something of a revival in hard-living , hard-playing rock .
they also owe a lot to the more flamboyant and colourful bands of the mid-1980s , such as queen and ac / dc .
bananarama the leading british girl group of the 1980s , bananarama had 14 uk top 20 hits from 1982-91 .
discovered by ex-sex pistols drummer paul cook , they were not afraid to be fluffy and inject a bit of fun into their songs and shows - in keeping with the age .
at the end of 1984 , they had just enjoyed their biggest hit to date , robert de niro 's waiting - a great pop tune with lyrics that dealt with the issue of rape .
sugababes another hit all-girl trio , sugababes have tried to present themselves as much cooler than the average fluffy group , winning a brit award for best dance group in 2003 .
but they have always remained in the pop mould , not least because they have had three songs popular enough to go to number one - something bananarama never achieved .
they have had a total of 11 uk top 20 singles over four years - fast approaching bananarama 's tally .
spandau ballet spandau ballet were one of the more restrained pop groups of the mid-1980s , preferring smoother ballads to the more high-octane offerings of other big names .
but they did still employ the same electronic effects and backing harmonies as others around them .
they will be remembered for their biggest hits , gold and true , which epitomised the more sophisticated end of the glossy pop scene of 1983 .
travis travis would be horrified to be compared to spandau ballet - but both have an expert ear for a great tune that taps into the emotions and are separated by 15 years , several hundred cans of hairspray and little else .
travis are firmly in the rock camp , though , with a more conventional singer-guitars-drums set-up and ignoring any notion of synthesiser or saxophone input .
but their biggest hits , such as writing to reach you , why does it always rain on me ? and sing , are old-fashioned ballads that hit a nerve at the end of the 1990s .
the other acts say just as much about how much the uk music scene has changed in the last 20 years .
the first band aid single made £ 8m to help the starving in ethiopia duran duran , boy george , paul young , heaven 17 and kool and the gang - who all took part in the original band aid - are associated with a more gaudy era that shall forever remain frozen in history .
their nearest modern equivalents are today 's bubblegum pop acts like busted and will young - although duran duran are proving there is life in the 80s stars yet .
phil collins and sting , who also took part , were up there with george michael as global solo stars of the kind britain has struggled to produce since .
dido , who will lend her vocals to the new single , is the nearest the uk has got - and she only found fame after appearing on an eminem single .
rap was barely on the radar in 1984 , as was the modern , hip-hop-infused r & b of the sort beverley knight , jamelia , ms dynamite , lemar and estelle will bring to the new song .
the female presence will be much higher this time .
in 1984 , there was only bananarama and jody watley , singer with soul group shalamar .
but this time , as well as dido and the r & b princesses , there will be chart-topper natasha bedingfield , easy-jazz singer katie melua and morcheeba 's skye edwards .
more rock acts , such as feeder , keane , snow patrol and ash 's tim wheeler , are all expected to take part this time .
sir paul mccartney , arguably the uk 's biggest living music legend , was not involved in 1984 - but does not want to miss out this time .
last but not least on the 1984 roll-call were boomtown rats singer bob geldof and ultravox 's midge ure - who made it all happen .

but how do modern stars match up to the original line-up of 1984 ?
george michael the wham ! singer was one of the biggest stars at the time of band aid , after the duo had huge global hits that year with wake me up before you go go and freedom .
michael also had his first solo success with careless whisper .
wham ! would have had the uk christmas number one too with last christmas - their biggest-selling single - had band aid not been released .
although only a duo , wham ! 's style set the trend for future boy bands , and michael continued to have huge solo success - unlike his partner andrew ridgley .
robbie williams everyone expected williams to be the andrew ridgley rather than the george michael of take that after the most popular british boy band of the 1990s split up .
but williams ' boy band days are now behind him and he has gone on to be the most successful uk music star for the best part of a decade .
like michael , he achieved that with a mixture of ballads and upbeat dancefloor-friendly songs - although he has never matched michael 's us success .
his last album , escapology , has sold six million copies worldwide - but only 130,000 of those came in the us .
bono by 1984 , u2 had been going for eight years and just had their biggest hit with pride -lrb- in the name of love -rrb- .
many u2 songs had political messages but lead singer bono 's global campaigning really started after band aid , and he has become a forceful voice on aids and global debt .
they were one of the biggest new rock bands around and , with the smiths , provided a more credible alternative to the prevalent pop acts of the day .
but bono also had one of the worst mullet hairstyles of the 1980s - which is saying something .
he is expected to join the line-up again this time .
chris martin coldplay are at a similar stage in their careers as u2 were in 1984 , and frontman chris martin even had a silly hairstyle in their early days .
coldplay 's music is similarly grand , although they have been accused of being too effete and making " music for bedwetters " .
but they have enjoyed success on both sides of the atlantic , winning the record of the year at the grammys this year .
martin is leading the current crop of rock stars with a conscience , campaigning for fair global trade .
status quo masters of the 12-bar boogie , status quo were veterans of the british rock scene even in 1984 , after 15 years in the business .
but they were still enjoying regular top 10 hits at the time of band aid , with a style that may not have been very complex or deep , but was certainly popular .
they opened live aid the following year and have sold more than 100 million albums , despite being banned by radio 1 in 1995 .
the darkness the uk 's latest heavy rock gods do not have as much mileage behind them as the quo , but the bands share a love of a no-nonsense guitar riff .
the darkness shot to fame in 2003 and won three brit awards in february 2004 , cementing something of a revival in hard-living , hard-playing rock .
they also owe a lot to the more flamboyant and colourful bands of the mid-1980s , such as queen and ac / dc .
bananarama the leading british girl group of the 1980s , bananarama had 14 uk top 20 hits from 1982-91 .
discovered by ex-sex pistols drummer paul cook , they were not afraid to be fluffy and inject a bit of fun into their songs and shows - in keeping with the age .
at the end of 1984 , they had just enjoyed their biggest hit to date , robert de niro 's waiting - a great pop tune with lyrics that dealt with the issue of rape .
sugababes another hit all-girl trio , sugababes have tried to present themselves as much cooler than the average fluffy group , winning a brit award for best dance group in 2003 .
but they have always remained in the pop mould , not least because they have had three songs popular enough to go to number one - something bananarama never achieved .
they have had a total of 11 uk top 20 singles over four years - fast approaching bananarama 's tally .
spandau ballet spandau ballet were one of the more restrained pop groups of the mid-1980s , preferring smoother ballads to the more high-octane offerings of other big names .
but they did still employ the same electronic effects and backing harmonies as others around them .
they will be remembered for their biggest hits , gold and true , which epitomised the more sophisticated end of the glossy pop scene of 1983 .
travis travis would be horrified to be compared to spandau ballet - but both have an expert ear for a great tune that taps into the emotions and are separated by 15 years , several hundred cans of hairspray and little else .
travis are firmly in the rock camp , though , with a more conventional singer-guitars-drums set-up and ignoring any notion of synthesiser or saxophone input .
but their biggest hits , such as writing to reach you , why does it always rain on me ? and sing , are old-fashioned ballads that hit a nerve at the end of the 1990s .
the other acts say just as much about how much the uk music scene has changed in the last 20 years .
the first band aid single made £ 8m to help the starving in ethiopia duran duran , boy george , paul young , heaven 17 and kool and the gang - who all took part in the original band aid - are associated with a more gaudy era that shall forever remain frozen in history .
their nearest modern equivalents are today 's bubblegum pop acts like busted and will young - although duran duran are proving there is life in the 80s stars yet .
phil collins and sting , who also took part , were up there with george michael as global solo stars of the kind britain has struggled to produce since .
dido , who will lend her vocals to the new single , is the nearest the uk has got - and she only found fame after appearing on an eminem single .
rap was barely on the radar in 1984 , as was the modern , hip-hop-infused r & b of the sort beverley knight , jamelia , ms dynamite , lemar and estelle will bring to the new song .
the female presence will be much higher this time .
in 1984 , there was only bananarama and jody watley , singer with soul group shalamar .
but this time , as well as dido and the r & b princesses , there will be chart-topper natasha bedingfield , easy-jazz singer katie melua and morcheeba 's skye edwards .
more rock acts , such as feeder , keane , snow patrol and ash 's tim wheeler , are all expected to take part this time .
sir paul mccartney , arguably the uk 's biggest living music legend , was not involved in 1984 - but does not want to miss out this time .
last but not least on the 1984 roll-call were boomtown rats singer bob geldof and ultravox 's midge ure - who made it all happen .
