program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution has awakened debate over plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics . in france , voters will be entitled to make the ultimate decision on the fate of the draft european constitution . that 's also the case in britain and denmark and at least seven other eu countries .
but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .
" we need a broad debate in germany that asks , when do direct democratic elements through voter participation in referendums or similar interesting instruments complement -lrb- our -rrb- representative democracy , without being seen as a replacement for the national or european parliaments ? " heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a referendum for germany after all ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives .

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .

as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "
in preparation for the sept .

müntefering calls for unity with cdu spd chief franz müntefering called on the cdu to express its support for the coming labor reforms , which will merge social welfare and unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed starting in january .
the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .
former communists lead in polls meanwhile , jörg schönbohm , brandenburg 's interior minister and the cdu 's leading candidate , said his party wanted to continue its government coalition with the social democrats and that there was " no alternative . "
of the parties represented in the state parliament , he said , the spd was the " natural coalitions party . "
but both parties face enormous challenges in the state .
the latest survey by pollster infratest dimap shows the pds with a growing lead , with the spd and cdu trailing in second and third place .
cdu : a bad public awareness strategy over the weekend schönbohm and merkel rebuked the social democrats for what they described as technical errors and a lacking public awareness strategy for the reforms .
they added that it had been a " dramatic error " to send out paperwork forms to the unemployed before properly informing them about the changes in benefits they were facing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution has awakened debate over plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics . in france , voters will be entitled to make the ultimate decision on the fate of the draft european constitution . that 's also the case in britain and denmark and at least seven other eu countries .
but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .
" we need a broad debate in germany that asks , when do direct democratic elements through voter participation in referendums or similar interesting instruments complement -lrb- our -rrb- representative democracy , without being seen as a replacement for the national or european parliaments ?

but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .

last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .

but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .
he also slammed the cdu , saying they were trying to back pedal on their decisions to support the unemployment and welfare system overhaul . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

here is a wrap up of week two 's action . it was business as usual in the bundesliga as champions werder bremen continued the winning ways that brought the title to the weserstadion in may .
they thrashed hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far . after a balanced first half , the double winners turned on the style with two goals from croat ivan klasnic and one each from frenchman johan micoud and finnish newcomer petri pasanen .
although rostock disputed klasnic 's second , the third goal of the game , there could be no denying the gulf in quality as the game wore on .
werder keeper andreas reinke was singled out for praise by his team mates after the game for a string of fine saves that ensured his side went clear at the top of the table on six points after two matches . bayern munich 1-1 hertha bsc berlin championship rivals bayern munich labored against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium on saturday and will feel aggrieved at the 1-1 score line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's sebastian deisler -lrb- left -rrb- left , and berlin 's niko kovac from croatia -lrb- right -rrb- fight for the ball during the first division soccer match between fc bayern munich and hertha bsc berlin by the end of the first half , bayern would have willingly settled for that result after hertha 's brazilian marcelinho scored the opener in the 15th minute after a one-two with pal dardai .
the berliners then spent the rest of the half frustrating the bavarian giants who eventually resorted to strong-arm tactics and wild shots from distance . the second-half was a different story and bayern coach felix magath must have wondered why his players did n't take berlin apart in the final period . after roy makaay equalized from close range two minutes after the break , bayern looked a different team , although the hard tackles remained a feature for both sides . while more chances fell to bayern , magath and his team will sit in fourth place until next weekend wondering how they could have spurned so many gilt-edged opportunities to win the game . schalke 04 2-1 kaiserslautern two teams looking for their first win , schalke 04 and kaiserslautern made a number of changes to the teams that started the campaign with defeats in week one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian victor agali of fc schalke 04 shoots the second goal against goalkeeper georg koch of 1 .
fc kaiserslautern during the match on saturday the changes paid off for the visitors as kaiserslautern 's jochen seitz opened the scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker . but the first victory was to be schalke 's .
two strikes from gerald asamoah , one in each half - the first squeezed in from a tight angle , the second when free in the middle from a corner - gave the home side a deserved 2-1 win . mainz 2-1 hamburg sv bottom club hamburg were looking to get off the foot of the table against bundesliga newcomers mainz and went ahead through daniel van buyten , who reacted first to the rebound after a christian rahn shot to give the visitors the lead . however , brazilian antonio da silva took advantage of a mix-up in the hamburg defense shortly after halftime , then slotted in a second two minutes later to give mainz a 2-1 victory and root hamburg further to the bottom of the league . more match reports on the next page . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bruised bayern frustrated in berlin battle a bruising encounter in the munich olympic stadium between bayern and hertha berlin ended 1-1 on saturday as the home side fought tooth and nail for a second bundesliga victory .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .
after a dominant first half , despite conceding a goal , 10-man stuttgart lost the impetus in the second half and both sides ran the clock down for a 1-1 draw . bochum 2-2 leverkusen a cracking match on sunday saw regional rivals bochum and leverkusen clash in the ruhr stadion in the bundesliga 's first local derby . leverkusen , now unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings , eventually missed their chance to join champions werder bremen at the top of the table after czech forward vratislav lokvenc had given bochum a 29th minute lead .
a dimitar berbatov header in the 66th minute equalized only for christoph preuss to restore bochum 's advantage on 70 minutes .
leverkusen were saved from defeat by an 87th minute equalizer from ukranian andrej voronin which earned his team a point . wolfsburg 0-1 freiburg in the other sunday match , regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute with a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner after wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz had earlier seen a powerful first-half header hit the crossbar .
the 0-1 away win was freiburg 's first since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 . it could have been a different story , however .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .
after a dominant first half , despite conceding a goal , 10-man stuttgart lost the impetus in the second half and both sides ran the clock down for a 1-1 draw . bochum 2-2 leverkusen a cracking match on sunday saw regional rivals bochum and leverkusen clash in the ruhr stadion in the bundesliga 's first local derby . leverkusen , now unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings , eventually missed their chance to join champions werder bremen at the top of the table after czech forward vratislav lokvenc had given bochum a 29th minute lead .
a dimitar berbatov header in the 66th minute equalized only for christoph preuss to restore bochum 's advantage on 70 minutes .
leverkusen were saved from defeat by an 87th minute equalizer from ukranian andrej voronin which earned his team a point . wolfsburg 0-1 freiburg in the other sunday match , regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute with a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner after wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz had earlier seen a powerful first-half header hit the crossbar .
the 0-1 away win was freiburg 's first since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 . it could have been a different story , however .
wolfsburg were the more attacking side and were unlucky when a thomas brdaric header struck a post on 57 minutes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bruised bayern frustrated in berlin battle a bruising encounter in the munich olympic stadium between bayern and hertha berlin ended 1-1 on saturday as the home side fought tooth and nail for a second bundesliga victory .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .
he also slammed the cdu , saying they were trying to back pedal on their decisions to support the unemployment and welfare system overhaul . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .

senior defense department sources told the financial times that the plans were not intended as any sort of punishment for germany for its stance against the iraq war .
since entering office , the bush administration has been preparing a major restructuring of us forces .
indeed , discussions about cuts in germany have been on the radar for the past two years .
more than 100,000 us soldiers are currently stationed in europe , including close to 70,000 in germany .
another 100,000 are located in asia and the pacific region , and a total of 150,000 are stationed in afghanistan and iraq .
a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .
the countries include iraq war supporters poland and bulgaria , where costs of maintaining a military operation are considerably cheaper than in western europe .
germany has ' extreme overhead ' though the news does not come as a revelation , it does indicate the us will begin the expected cuts in the near future .
in june , us army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced the us would reduce its divisions in germany , where overhead costs are high , in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments .
gen. schoomaker stressed that the costs to keep troops stationed there were immensely high .

a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .

senior defense department sources told the financial times that the plans were not intended as any sort of punishment for germany for its stance against the iraq war .
since entering office , the bush administration has been preparing a major restructuring of us forces .
indeed , discussions about cuts in germany have been on the radar for the past two years .
more than 100,000 us soldiers are currently stationed in europe , including close to 70,000 in germany .
another 100,000 are located in asia and the pacific region , and a total of 150,000 are stationed in afghanistan and iraq .
a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .
the countries include iraq war supporters poland and bulgaria , where costs of maintaining a military operation are considerably cheaper than in western europe .
germany has ' extreme overhead ' though the news does not come as a revelation , it does indicate the us will begin the expected cuts in the near future .
in june , us army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced the us would reduce its divisions in germany , where overhead costs are high , in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments .
gen. schoomaker stressed that the costs to keep troops stationed there were immensely high . " as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. confirms troop reduction in germany the u.s. army 's top general said tuesday that his country would pull troops out of germany .

but allianz says it could be worse . munich re , the world 's largest reinsurer has estimated that damage from hurricane charley in the united states will cost the industry up to € 11 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- . hurricane charley hit florida at the end of last week , tearing across the region at speeds of 233 kilometers per hour , killing 16 people , devastating the region and leaving thousands of others homeless .
it has been described as the worst hurricane since andrew , which ravaged florida 12 years ago , leaving 26 people dead and causing € 16 billion worth of damage . allianz positive whilst a spokesman for munich re said the company was estimating a maximum payout of a low triple-digit million dollar range , he also told reporters that " such an incident was not totally unusual for munich re .

share prices for the company climbed slightly following the announcement , regaining some of the 1.7 percent they lost following the storm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite view of hurricane charely meanwhile , insurance giant allianz has estimated the negative impact on its results from the hurricane to be no higher than € 50 million .
the estimate is based on an inspection by the german company 's us subsidiary , fireman 's fund . reinsurers are generally harder hit by natural disasters because primary insurers can pass a large part of damages on to them .
that said , the drastic effects of hurricane andrew 12 years ago led to the creation of state insurance pools , which were designed to reduce the effects for both primary and re-insurers . positive results earlier today , allianz announced its half year results , painting a generally healthy picture of the company 's immediate future .
speaking in munich on monday , ceo michael diekmann said : " we are looking to the future with optimism , our group is en route to reach our high targets . "

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .
after a dominant first half , despite conceding a goal , 10-man stuttgart lost the impetus in the second half and both sides ran the clock down for a 1-1 draw . bochum 2-2 leverkusen a cracking match on sunday saw regional rivals bochum and leverkusen clash in the ruhr stadion in the bundesliga 's first local derby . leverkusen , now unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings , eventually missed their chance to join champions werder bremen at the top of the table after czech forward vratislav lokvenc had given bochum a 29th minute lead .
a dimitar berbatov header in the 66th minute equalized only for christoph preuss to restore bochum 's advantage on 70 minutes .
leverkusen were saved from defeat by an 87th minute equalizer from ukranian andrej voronin which earned his team a point . wolfsburg 0-1 freiburg in the other sunday match , regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute with a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner after wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz had earlier seen a powerful first-half header hit the crossbar .
the 0-1 away win was freiburg 's first since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 . it could have been a different story , however .
wolfsburg were the more attacking side and were unlucky when a thomas brdaric header struck a post on 57 minutes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bruised bayern frustrated in berlin battle a bruising encounter in the munich olympic stadium between bayern and hertha berlin ended 1-1 on saturday as the home side fought tooth and nail for a second bundesliga victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 back to the streets for anti-reform germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters vow to keep marching until the reforms are dropped the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .
for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .

he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution has awakened debate over plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics . in france , voters will be entitled to make the ultimate decision on the fate of the draft european constitution . that 's also the case in britain and denmark and at least seven other eu countries .
but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .
" we need a broad debate in germany that asks , when do direct democratic elements through voter participation in referendums or similar interesting instruments complement -lrb- our -rrb- representative democracy , without being seen as a replacement for the national or european parliaments ? " heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a referendum for germany after all ?

article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .

german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .

state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .

incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 schröder fights off ex-communists in state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back from vacation , gerhard schröder has his work cut out at a party conference in havel , chancellor gerhard schröder kicks off the campaign in the state of brandenburg , where unpopular reforms have pushed the former communists in the pds party to the top of polls . this weekend marked the start of serious campaigning in state elections in eastern germany 's brandenburg , with major conferences of the country 's ruling social and opposition christian democrats .
the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "
in preparation for the sept .
19 elections in brandenburg , the party on saturday elected state premier matthias platzeck as its main candidate .
müntefering calls for unity with cdu spd chief franz müntefering called on the cdu to express its support for the coming labor reforms , which will merge social welfare and unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed starting in january .
the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .
former communists lead in polls meanwhile , jörg schönbohm , brandenburg 's interior minister and the cdu 's leading candidate , said his party wanted to continue its government coalition with the social democrats and that there was " no alternative . "
of the parties represented in the state parliament , he said , the spd was the " natural coalitions party . "
but both parties face enormous challenges in the state .
the latest survey by pollster infratest dimap shows the pds with a growing lead , with the spd and cdu trailing in second and third place .

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "

he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .

müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "
in preparation for the sept .
19 elections in brandenburg , the party on saturday elected state premier matthias platzeck as its main candidate .
müntefering calls for unity with cdu spd chief franz müntefering called on the cdu to express its support for the coming labor reforms , which will merge social welfare and unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed starting in january .
the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .
former communists lead in polls meanwhile , jörg schönbohm , brandenburg 's interior minister and the cdu 's leading candidate , said his party wanted to continue its government coalition with the social democrats and that there was " no alternative . "
of the parties represented in the state parliament , he said , the spd was the " natural coalitions party . "
but both parties face enormous challenges in the state .
the latest survey by pollster infratest dimap shows the pds with a growing lead , with the spd and cdu trailing in second and third place .
cdu : a bad public awareness strategy over the weekend schönbohm and merkel rebuked the social democrats for what they described as technical errors and a lacking public awareness strategy for the reforms .
they added that it had been a " dramatic error " to send out paperwork forms to the unemployed before properly informing them about the changes in benefits they were facing .
schönbohm also took shots at the pds , saying the party had " stoked up fears and defamed " the reforms . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german welfare state at a turning point germany 's social insurance system is one of the most generous in the world and boasts both a long history and extended expansion course .

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "
in preparation for the sept .
19 elections in brandenburg , the party on saturday elected state premier matthias platzeck as its main candidate .
müntefering calls for unity with cdu spd chief franz müntefering called on the cdu to express its support for the coming labor reforms , which will merge social welfare and unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed starting in january .
the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .
former communists lead in polls meanwhile , jörg schönbohm , brandenburg 's interior minister and the cdu 's leading candidate , said his party wanted to continue its government coalition with the social democrats and that there was " no alternative . "
of the parties represented in the state parliament , he said , the spd was the " natural coalitions party . "
but both parties face enormous challenges in the state .
the latest survey by pollster infratest dimap shows the pds with a growing lead , with the spd and cdu trailing in second and third place .
cdu : a bad public awareness strategy over the weekend schönbohm and merkel rebuked the social democrats for what they described as technical errors and a lacking public awareness strategy for the reforms .
they added that it had been a " dramatic error " to send out paperwork forms to the unemployed before properly informing them about the changes in benefits they were facing .
schönbohm also took shots at the pds , saying the party had " stoked up fears and defamed " the reforms . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german welfare state at a turning point germany 's social insurance system is one of the most generous in the world and boasts both a long history and extended expansion course .

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .

müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .

cdu : a bad public awareness strategy over the weekend schönbohm and merkel rebuked the social democrats for what they described as technical errors and a lacking public awareness strategy for the reforms .

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "
in preparation for the sept .

müntefering calls for unity with cdu spd chief franz müntefering called on the cdu to express its support for the coming labor reforms , which will merge social welfare and unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed starting in january .
the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .
former communists lead in polls meanwhile , jörg schönbohm , brandenburg 's interior minister and the cdu 's leading candidate , said his party wanted to continue its government coalition with the social democrats and that there was " no alternative . "
of the parties represented in the state parliament , he said , the spd was the " natural coalitions party . "
but both parties face enormous challenges in the state .
the latest survey by pollster infratest dimap shows the pds with a growing lead , with the spd and cdu trailing in second and third place .
cdu : a bad public awareness strategy over the weekend schönbohm and merkel rebuked the social democrats for what they described as technical errors and a lacking public awareness strategy for the reforms .
they added that it had been a " dramatic error " to send out paperwork forms to the unemployed before properly informing them about the changes in benefits they were facing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution has awakened debate over plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics . in france , voters will be entitled to make the ultimate decision on the fate of the draft european constitution . that 's also the case in britain and denmark and at least seven other eu countries .
but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .

but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .

however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .
" we need a broad debate in germany that asks , when do direct democratic elements through voter participation in referendums or similar interesting instruments complement -lrb- our -rrb- representative democracy , without being seen as a replacement for the national or european parliaments ? " heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a referendum for germany after all ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives .
-lrb- july 25 , 2004 -rrb- german parliament considers referendum bill democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it .
-lrb- june 6 , 2002 -rrb- feedback should germany change its legislation to allow voters to initiate referendums more readily ?

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .

last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .

"
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .
he also slammed the cdu , saying they were trying to back pedal on their decisions to support the unemployment and welfare system overhaul . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .
after a dominant first half , despite conceding a goal , 10-man stuttgart lost the impetus in the second half and both sides ran the clock down for a 1-1 draw . bochum 2-2 leverkusen a cracking match on sunday saw regional rivals bochum and leverkusen clash in the ruhr stadion in the bundesliga 's first local derby . leverkusen , now unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings , eventually missed their chance to join champions werder bremen at the top of the table after czech forward vratislav lokvenc had given bochum a 29th minute lead .
a dimitar berbatov header in the 66th minute equalized only for christoph preuss to restore bochum 's advantage on 70 minutes .
leverkusen were saved from defeat by an 87th minute equalizer from ukranian andrej voronin which earned his team a point . wolfsburg 0-1 freiburg in the other sunday match , regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute with a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner after wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz had earlier seen a powerful first-half header hit the crossbar .
the 0-1 away win was freiburg 's first since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 . it could have been a different story , however .
wolfsburg were the more attacking side and were unlucky when a thomas brdaric header struck a post on 57 minutes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bruised bayern frustrated in berlin battle a bruising encounter in the munich olympic stadium between bayern and hertha berlin ended 1-1 on saturday as the home side fought tooth and nail for a second bundesliga victory .

" our high-definition , 3-d maps give a view of deep portions of the brain that otherwise are very hard to decipher , " amunts said in an interview with dw-world .
the brain maps she ’ s making at the helmholtz association research center in jülich , near aachen , germany , may eventually provide doctors with precise diagrams they need to develop new therapies for parkinson 's and other brain diseases .
amunts ’ work is part of a pilot program that established 20 research groups and was successful enough to convince the helmholtz association to expand its young investigators program , dr. bärbel köster , a helmholtz spokeswoman , told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finish the research , and you 've started on your way to a professorship the enlarged program will support 20 research groups for five years with up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 152,825 -rrb- .
every year 20 new groups will be started until 100 groups are always running , she said .
at a time when " brain drain " dominates many scientific discussions , and politicians expect the germany 's highest court to lift the ban on fees for higher education , more money could help attract top scientists .
career chances amunts acknowledged the problem , but said she has the ideal infrastructure here in germany and will stay to focus and supplement her primary results .
she still has two more brains to dissect .
though she ’ s not the only researcher left in germany , every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves for the united states , estimated the scientist magazine last year .
helmholtz has made sure the scientists who take part in the extended program will also have a reason to stay in germany .
they are guaranteed a tenure position at the university , as long as they receive a final positive evaluation .
application criteria applicants from all over the world are encouraged to apply , but they have to have received their doctoral degree two to six years ago , have international research experience , be under 36 years old and able to work at one of helmholtz 's 15 research centers or a partner university .
köster has already received about 20 applications , but said she imagines the partner centers have received many more .
the deadline for applications is nov .
1 .
the helmholtz association , with its annual budget of about € 2.1 billion and 24,000 employees , conducts research in the fields of energy , earth and environment , health , key technologies , structure of matter , and transport and space . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .

a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution has awakened debate over plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics . in france , voters will be entitled to make the ultimate decision on the fate of the draft european constitution . that 's also the case in britain and denmark and at least seven other eu countries .
but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .
" we need a broad debate in germany that asks , when do direct democratic elements through voter participation in referendums or similar interesting instruments complement -lrb- our -rrb- representative democracy , without being seen as a replacement for the national or european parliaments ? " heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a referendum for germany after all ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives .
-lrb- july 25 , 2004 -rrb- german parliament considers referendum bill democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it .
-lrb- june 6 , 2002 -rrb- feedback should germany change its legislation to allow voters to initiate referendums more readily ?

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antiwar protesters block the entry gate to the us forces ' european headquarters in stuttgart , germany .
senior defense department sources told the financial times that the plans were not intended as any sort of punishment for germany for its stance against the iraq war .
since entering office , the bush administration has been preparing a major restructuring of us forces .
indeed , discussions about cuts in germany have been on the radar for the past two years .
more than 100,000 us soldiers are currently stationed in europe , including close to 70,000 in germany .
another 100,000 are located in asia and the pacific region , and a total of 150,000 are stationed in afghanistan and iraq .
a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .
the countries include iraq war supporters poland and bulgaria , where costs of maintaining a military operation are considerably cheaper than in western europe .
germany has ' extreme overhead ' though the news does not come as a revelation , it does indicate the us will begin the expected cuts in the near future .
in june , us army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced the us would reduce its divisions in germany , where overhead costs are high , in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments .
gen. schoomaker stressed that the costs to keep troops stationed there were immensely high . " as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. confirms troop reduction in germany the u.s. army 's top general said tuesday that his country would pull troops out of germany .

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antiwar protesters block the entry gate to the us forces ' european headquarters in stuttgart , germany .
senior defense department sources told the financial times that the plans were not intended as any sort of punishment for germany for its stance against the iraq war .
since entering office , the bush administration has been preparing a major restructuring of us forces .
indeed , discussions about cuts in germany have been on the radar for the past two years .
more than 100,000 us soldiers are currently stationed in europe , including close to 70,000 in germany .
another 100,000 are located in asia and the pacific region , and a total of 150,000 are stationed in afghanistan and iraq .
a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .
the countries include iraq war supporters poland and bulgaria , where costs of maintaining a military operation are considerably cheaper than in western europe .
germany has ' extreme overhead ' though the news does not come as a revelation , it does indicate the us will begin the expected cuts in the near future .
in june , us army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced the us would reduce its divisions in germany , where overhead costs are high , in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2004 eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution has awakened debate over plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics . in france , voters will be entitled to make the ultimate decision on the fate of the draft european constitution . that 's also the case in britain and denmark and at least seven other eu countries .
but why not germany ?
opponents of a referendum - including chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and opposition christian democratic union chairwoman angela merkel - have all pointed out on numerous occasions that germany 's own constitution promotes representational democracy , a political philosophy that leaves little room for plebiscites .
under the country 's constitution , the so-called basic law , referendums are only called for in the case of restructuring the country 's federal territory .
article 20 of the constitution holds that all state authority is derived from the people and shall be exercised " by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . "
in other words , the constitution does leave , at least theoretically , breathing room for stronger plebiscite elements .
however , legislation from the ruling social democratic and green parties introduced in 2002 to strengthen the role of referendums failed to obtain the two-thirds majority support it needed to clear parliament .
parliament to have last say on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german politicians want to keep major national decision-making here at the reichstag currently , it 's almost unthinkable that germany would hold a referendum on the constitution .
instead , germany 's two chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , will ratify the constitution .
german politicians are n't alone in their belief that the bundestag and bundesrat have sufficient legitimacy to ratify the constitution .
according to andreas maurer of the german institute for international and security affairs , a referendum on the constitution would n't make sense because the document " is too long and will relatively quickly represent itself as being in accordance with international law .
but it 's also a treaty that can be changed at any time .
it 's not a document that the european union or its citizens can really call a constitution - at least not one that would be comparable to the basic law . "
state referendums some german states already have provisions in their state constitutions allowing for the possibility of plebiscites .
local citizens do frequently take advantage of these laws .
often the referendums are held on regional issues - a plebiscite that would deal , for example , with the construction of a roadway bypass - but sometimes the issues have wider ramifications .
a number of years ago , voters in bavaria chose to eliminate their state senate .
the advisory second chamber of the state parliament was ultimately dissolved through a referendum initiated by voters in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans must gather thousands of signatures to get the most basic and local of referendums on regional or state ballots .
but even in places where referendums are legal , they are still complicated business .
the process usually starts with a petition for a referendum which requires a minimum number of signatures from local voters .
if the organizers succeed , then the local community government or state parliament must take up the issue .
only if the government is unable to come to a resolution is the issue then put before local voters for a referendum .
incidentally , referendums also require the support of a minimum number of voters in the state or community in order to be valid .
fear of chaos thus , the hurdles are pretty high .
but they have n't been made so without reason . generally , the fear is that plebiscites could open the door for any demagogue off the street to put issues before voters .
it 's a line of argument that is often applied by berlin , which has only to look back at the failed weimar republic for evidence of the problems the political fringe can unleash .
during the short-lived history of germany 's first democracy , demagogues of every political persuasion had broad playing room .
but critics of this line of argument note that only two referendums took place during the weimar republic , which existed from 1918 to 1933 .
" germans have learned so much since then and have become so experienced in democracy that they would n't have any problems dealing with referendums on constitutional questions , " said maurer .
it 's also possible that in the future some " bigger questions " will be determined by plebiscite in germany , but the limites must be clear .
the catalogue of basic rights set forth in the constitution , for example , should not be put up for a public vote , maurer said .
nor would he allow the federal budget to be determined by any referendum .

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "
in preparation for the sept .
19 elections in brandenburg , the party on saturday elected state premier matthias platzeck as its main candidate .
müntefering calls for unity with cdu spd chief franz müntefering called on the cdu to express its support for the coming labor reforms , which will merge social welfare and unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed starting in january .
the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .
former communists lead in polls meanwhile , jörg schönbohm , brandenburg 's interior minister and the cdu 's leading candidate , said his party wanted to continue its government coalition with the social democrats and that there was " no alternative . "

the gatherings were accompanied by the usual political salvos and finger pointing , much of it over chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial labor market reforms .
now the opposition christian democratic union as well as the leftist , party of social democracy , the successor party to east germany 's communists , have jumped on the union 's bandwagon in criticizing the reforms .
schröder : pds and cdu resorting to populism with pds and cdu wagons circling in from the left and the right , schröder said , they were attempting to create a new " people 's front . "
speaking at a state party conference in the city of havel , brandenburg , schröder accused the pds of " fomenting resentment against the reforms . "
as for the cdu , he said , the party is trying to tip toe away from decisions that it supported and voted for in order to stay in power .
he also accused the parties of engaging in populist activity .
at the party conference , schröder also reiterated his desire to stay in office until the end of the current legislature period , which comes to an end in 2006 .
in an interview with public broadcaster zdf , schröder said he intends to run for a third term in the chancellery .
though his candidacy wo n't be support by all members of his party , he said , " there will be broad support in the spd . "

the reforms will leave many longterm unemployed with fewer benefits , but the government has argued the changes are necessary to give the hobbling economy a needed boost .
müntefering said it was the job of cdu chairwoman angela merkel to see to it that union politicians in the federal and state government do not boycott the reform measures .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , müntefering said the leading opposition party must also help with the implementation of the difficult reforms .

the estimate is based on an inspection by the german company 's us subsidiary , fireman 's fund . reinsurers are generally harder hit by natural disasters because primary insurers can pass a large part of damages on to them .

speaking in munich on monday , ceo michael diekmann said : " we are looking to the future with optimism , our group is en route to reach our high targets . "

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .

since entering office , the bush administration has been preparing a major restructuring of us forces .

another 100,000 are located in asia and the pacific region , and a total of 150,000 are stationed in afghanistan and iraq .
a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .
the countries include iraq war supporters poland and bulgaria , where costs of maintaining a military operation are considerably cheaper than in western europe .
germany has ' extreme overhead ' though the news does not come as a revelation , it does indicate the us will begin the expected cuts in the near future .

altogether , about 70,000 troops and 100,000 civil employees and family members currently stationed in europe and asia are expected to be moved elsewhere .
as many as two thirds of the 70,000 soldiers stationed in germany could be affected although rumsfeld declined to give any numbers .
he added that the changes had been discussed with german officials , who had been supportive .
" there will be a shift from germany , and we 've talked to the germans about that , and some numbers , " rumsfeld said .
" they are doing the same thing - they 're also readjusting their forces and they understand that . "
president george w. bush is expected to announce details of the plan monday during a speech at the convention of veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati , ohio .
according to reports , he will say that two-thirds of the reductions will come from europe .
a senior aid involved in the planning told the washington post the president plans to say that the change " is necessary to adapt the nation 's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technologies . "
german bases to be hard hit additionally , two army divisions currently based in germany - the 1st armored and the 1st infantry - could be moved back to the us , the financial times stated .
however , germany would still remain the main european operations center for the us military , with the largest number of troops - home to training facilities and a rapid-reaction force .
the shuffle would also include a relocation of the navy 's european headquarters from london to naples , italy .

senior defense department sources told the financial times that the plans were not intended as any sort of punishment for germany for its stance against the iraq war .
since entering office , the bush administration has been preparing a major restructuring of us forces .
indeed , discussions about cuts in germany have been on the radar for the past two years .
more than 100,000 us soldiers are currently stationed in europe , including close to 70,000 in germany .
another 100,000 are located in asia and the pacific region , and a total of 150,000 are stationed in afghanistan and iraq .
a number of troops are expected to be moved to former eastern bloc countries that recently joined the nato alliance and , in some cases , the eu .
the countries include iraq war supporters poland and bulgaria , where costs of maintaining a military operation are considerably cheaper than in western europe .
germany has ' extreme overhead ' though the news does not come as a revelation , it does indicate the us will begin the expected cuts in the near future .
in june , us army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced the us would reduce its divisions in germany , where overhead costs are high , in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments .
gen. schoomaker stressed that the costs to keep troops stationed there were immensely high . " as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. confirms troop reduction in germany the u.s. army 's top general said tuesday that his country would pull troops out of germany .

she ’ s sliced eight of them micrometer thin , analyzed them under the microscope and created precise maps to show doctors what ’ s happening deep in humans ’ minds .
" our high-definition , 3-d maps give a view of deep portions of the brain that otherwise are very hard to decipher , " amunts said in an interview with dw-world .
the brain maps she ’ s making at the helmholtz association research center in jülich , near aachen , germany , may eventually provide doctors with precise diagrams they need to develop new therapies for parkinson 's and other brain diseases .
amunts ’ work is part of a pilot program that established 20 research groups and was successful enough to convince the helmholtz association to expand its young investigators program , dr. bärbel köster , a helmholtz spokeswoman , told dw-world .

every year 20 new groups will be started until 100 groups are always running , she said .
at a time when " brain drain " dominates many scientific discussions , and politicians expect the germany 's highest court to lift the ban on fees for higher education , more money could help attract top scientists .
career chances amunts acknowledged the problem , but said she has the ideal infrastructure here in germany and will stay to focus and supplement her primary results .
she still has two more brains to dissect .
though she ’ s not the only researcher left in germany , every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves for the united states , estimated the scientist magazine last year .
helmholtz has made sure the scientists who take part in the extended program will also have a reason to stay in germany .
they are guaranteed a tenure position at the university , as long as they receive a final positive evaluation .
application criteria applicants from all over the world are encouraged to apply , but they have to have received their doctoral degree two to six years ago , have international research experience , be under 36 years old and able to work at one of helmholtz 's 15 research centers or a partner university .
köster has already received about 20 applications , but said she imagines the partner centers have received many more .
the deadline for applications is nov .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .
after a dominant first half , despite conceding a goal , 10-man stuttgart lost the impetus in the second half and both sides ran the clock down for a 1-1 draw . bochum 2-2 leverkusen a cracking match on sunday saw regional rivals bochum and leverkusen clash in the ruhr stadion in the bundesliga 's first local derby . leverkusen , now unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings , eventually missed their chance to join champions werder bremen at the top of the table after czech forward vratislav lokvenc had given bochum a 29th minute lead .
a dimitar berbatov header in the 66th minute equalized only for christoph preuss to restore bochum 's advantage on 70 minutes .
leverkusen were saved from defeat by an 87th minute equalizer from ukranian andrej voronin which earned his team a point . wolfsburg 0-1 freiburg in the other sunday match , regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute with a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner after wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz had earlier seen a powerful first-half header hit the crossbar .
the 0-1 away win was freiburg 's first since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 . it could have been a different story , however .

the home side 's czech midfielder ivo ulich was left free in the middle to convert a christian ziege cross in the seventh minute , only for dortmund 's danish newcomer niclas jensen to equalize seven minutes later .
his free kick benefited from a deflection . markus hausweiler 's sharp turn and thunderous shot from 20 meters restored the home side 's advantage but headers from czech striker jan koller and brazilian ewerthon in the 36th and 38th minute gave the visitors the win . nuremberg 1-1 stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart were up against surprising second placers nuremberg on saturday and took the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau , who rushed onto a cross to open the scoring in the seventh minute . however , stuttgart 's hero soon turned to villain after he was dismissed after a second yellow card just before halftime .
nuremberg had previously equalized before cacau saw red , croat ivica banovic turning the visitor 's defense and thumping in a left-footed shot in 15th minute .
after a dominant first half , despite conceding a goal , 10-man stuttgart lost the impetus in the second half and both sides ran the clock down for a 1-1 draw . bochum 2-2 leverkusen a cracking match on sunday saw regional rivals bochum and leverkusen clash in the ruhr stadion in the bundesliga 's first local derby . leverkusen , now unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings , eventually missed their chance to join champions werder bremen at the top of the table after czech forward vratislav lokvenc had given bochum a 29th minute lead .
a dimitar berbatov header in the 66th minute equalized only for christoph preuss to restore bochum 's advantage on 70 minutes .
leverkusen were saved from defeat by an 87th minute equalizer from ukranian andrej voronin which earned his team a point . wolfsburg 0-1 freiburg in the other sunday match , regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute with a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner after wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz had earlier seen a powerful first-half header hit the crossbar .
the 0-1 away win was freiburg 's first since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 . it could have been a different story , however .
wolfsburg were the more attacking side and were unlucky when a thomas brdaric header struck a post on 57 minutes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bruised bayern frustrated in berlin battle a bruising encounter in the munich olympic stadium between bayern and hertha berlin ended 1-1 on saturday as the home side fought tooth and nail for a second bundesliga victory .

they thrashed hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far . after a balanced first half , the double winners turned on the style with two goals from croat ivan klasnic and one each from frenchman johan micoud and finnish newcomer petri pasanen .

the berliners then spent the rest of the half frustrating the bavarian giants who eventually resorted to strong-arm tactics and wild shots from distance . the second-half was a different story and bayern coach felix magath must have wondered why his players did n't take berlin apart in the final period . after roy makaay equalized from close range two minutes after the break , bayern looked a different team , although the hard tackles remained a feature for both sides . while more chances fell to bayern , magath and his team will sit in fourth place until next weekend wondering how they could have spurned so many gilt-edged opportunities to win the game . schalke 04 2-1 kaiserslautern two teams looking for their first win , schalke 04 and kaiserslautern made a number of changes to the teams that started the campaign with defeats in week one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian victor agali of fc schalke 04 shoots the second goal against goalkeeper georg koch of 1 .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .

for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country . with protest organizers expecting rallies in as many as 150 towns across germany later today , demonstrators remain clearly dissatisfied with schröder 's reform package and equally unimpressed with his efforts to appease them with the promise of some slight amendments . last week 's rallies , the first in what protesters have dubbed " monday demonstrations , " were largely staged in the former east germany , in a total of 55 towns with thousands of participants .
but this week , the movement has spread to all parts of the country , and action is expected in numerous cities in western germany , including cologne , dortmund , stuttgart and hamburg . in the east , organizers have announced planned action in towns and cities spanning the entire length and breadth of the region , and they vow to continue with the monday demonstrations until the reform package is dropped altogether . insufficient information at issue are controversial plans to change the system of welfare and unemployment benefit payments .
as it stands , the jobless are granted different rates of payment depending upon how long they have been out of work .
under the new plans , the lower rate will be scrapped , and brought in line with the less generous welfare benefit . the government is at great pains to stress that the reforms will not push german citizens into a life of poverty , and has further responded to the wave of protest action by publishing ads in the nation 's press to detail the implications of their plans . many feel the explanations are long overdue .
speaking to radio broadcaster deutschlandradio on monday , saxon-anhalt 's premier , wolfgang böhmer , said the public had not been given sufficient information about the reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and there are indications that he is not far off the mark .
last week , economics and labor minister wolfgang clement amended the two most controversial elements of the ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' package .
he proposed starting payments from the beginning of january next year , which would ensure all recipients receive 12 payments in 2005 .
he also made concessions on how much money can be paid into savings accounts belonging to children of the unemployed before parents ' jobless benefits are reduced .
but those amendments have clearly done little to soothe the anxious public . new criticism for schröder the opposition christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the successor to the east german communist party , the pds , have rejected chancellor schröder 's claim that they have joined forces to create a popular front against his reform plans .
in an interview with the mass-circulation daily bild , cdu party leader angela merkel described schröder 's comments as " totally unfitting , " adding that it would never have been possible to create ' arbeitslosengeld ii ' without the agreement of the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds party leader lothar bisky opposes the government 's reforms speaking to the berliner zeitung newspaper , pds party leader , lothar bisky said , " i find it alarming that the chancellor should resuscitate the language of the cold war . "
he said there was no need to form a popular front , but that plain common sense was enough to recognize that the planned reforms were poison for the structurally weak regions eastern and western parts of the country . speaking at a state party conference at the weekend , schröder accused the pds of stirring up resentment against the reforms .

government funding should not be reduced as a result . a second proposal deals with recruiting researchers and students .

the scheme will be run in four areas across scotland .
petty offenders will be required to demonstrate improved behaviour between court appearances .
they may have to take part in sessions with social work staff and other professionals and if they do not they could be given a punitive penalty .
ms jamieson said : " there are a large number of petty offenders who appear before our lower courts who might benefit from some form of social work intervention or supervision .
" historically , where sentence had been deferred , there has been little opportunity for social workers to become involved in helping the offender overcome the causes of their criminal behaviour .
criminal record " introducing structured deferred sentences as an additional option for courts will provide the opportunity for offenders to follow a programme which could include regular meetings with social work staff , and addressing those issues which might have contributed to their criminal behaviour . "
she said that where courts take such an option , the onus is on petty offenders to prove that they want to move on .
ms jamieson believes that if the offender takes part successfully in that programme then they are likely to be admonished and therefore avoid a criminal record .
cathy jamieson : " committed to a safer scotland " the minister added : " this is one further step in a major national initiative to increase the range and number of community sentences .
" earlier this year we piloted the mandatory use of supervised attendance orders for fine defaulters and last week the first minister confirmed the introduction of pilot community reparation orders .
" we are committed to giving the police and the courts what they need to help deliver a safer , stronger scotland . "
an announcement on the four areas in which the pilot for structured deferred sentences will take place is to be made shortly .
the pilots will begin before the end of the year and run for up to two years .
a decision on whether to roll-out the scheme will be made on the basis of ongoing evaluation of the pilots .

"
she said that where courts take such an option , the onus is on petty offenders to prove that they want to move on .
ms jamieson believes that if the offender takes part successfully in that programme then they are likely to be admonished and therefore avoid a criminal record .
the minister added : " this is one further step in a major national initiative to increase the range and number of community sentences .
" earlier this year we piloted the mandatory use of supervised attendance orders for fine defaulters and last week the first minister confirmed the introduction of pilot community reparation orders .
" we are committed to giving the police and the courts what they need to help deliver a safer , stronger scotland . "
an announcement on the four areas in which the pilot for structured deferred sentences will take place is to be made shortly .
the pilots will begin before the end of the year and run for up to two years .
a decision on whether to roll-out the scheme will be made on the basis of ongoing evaluation of the pilots .

the suit restricts the wearer 's mobility to mimic the effects of conditions such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis .
experts say the apparatus will help them draw up plans for derby 's new £ 333m super hospital .
but campaigners insist they should be consulting people with disabilities to help with the blueprint .
different disabilities the suit was developed by scientists at loughborough university and adapted by the building firm skanska .
it is being used by capita to design the new hospital , which is being built on the existing derby city general hospital site .
the suit has splints and restrictors that limit the movement of joints such as the hand , wrists , elbows , neck , upper and lower torso , knees and ankles to simulate the loss of mobility caused by ageing and arthritis . "
disabled people are the experts on what they require " nancy pountain , derby access group the aim of using the suit is to give architects a better understanding of the problems patients have using fixtures such as toilets , wardrobes and doors .
nancy pountain , from derby access group , said the suit should not replace the views of disabled people .
she said : " disabled people are the experts on what they require , and every disability is different - everybody has different ways of not being able to achieve things .
" if it is only used for this purpose - for the architect to at least have an insight into the conditions people are suffering - then this could be a help .
" but to replace the views of the disabled person , it is not on . "
' new insight ' howard geoffrey , from skanska , said the suit is complimentary to input from disabled groups .
" there is nothing like appreciating mobility than by having it taken away .
" to take away the architect 's mobility , he then experiences himself the difficulties , so when he 's putting pen to paper to actually design the room , he has a new insight into the problems real people have in the hospital . "
brian ible , assistant chief executive of derby hospitals nhs foundation trust , said : " i think you require a whole range of different tools to get the hospital as best you can .
