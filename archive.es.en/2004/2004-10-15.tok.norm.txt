karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .
the state is n't suited to repair broken business ; note the example of philipp holzmann .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .

of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .

" i want to leave you in no doubt of how important strengthened eu capacities are to the united nations , " kofi annan said during an address on eu-un cooperation in crisis management at the forum on europe at dublin castle .
" the eu is in a position to provide specialized skills that our largest troop contributors may not be able to give us , and to deploy more rapidly than we can , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan " the eu and its member states pay a lot of the un 's bills , and support our work right across the spectrum .
i am deeply grateful for that - but i look to europe for even more .
that 's why i welcome the development of eu capabilities in the context of the european security and defense policy , and the progress that we are making together in the field of crisis management . "
european proposal the european union wants to set up rapid-reaction battle groups for troublespots around the globe but acknowledges a chronic lack of key military equipment stands in its way .
britain , france and germany have proposed establishing two or three units of 1,500 troops each by next year .
by 2007 there may be as many as nine groups in a standing rota that could be deployed within 10 days .

their most likely use would be to restore order or stabilise a crisis zone and fill a crucial gap of up to three months until a u.n. peacekeeping force can be deployed , as a french-led eu force did in bunia , eastern congo , last year .
the move has been officially welcomed by the nato alliance , which last year formed its own 20,000-strong rapid response force .
the un secretary-general noted many people were alive today because of the french-led operation artemis in the congo , which in turn handed over to a un operation .
he called artemis a model of eu cooperation with the un .
greater demand annan said the un is facing a surge in demand for peacekeeping and the european security and defence policy must not mean a weakening of the commitment of eu member states to provide traditional blue-helmeted troops for un missions .
" in the last nine months , with five new operations either deployed or on the drawing board , the demand on our peacekeeping has jumped by about 50 percent , " he said .
" we have around 56,000 troops and military observers deployed today .
but we desperately need another 30,000 of them - not to mention many more civilian personnel , both police and others , " he said .
" yet today , less than one in 10 un peacekeepers is from an eu country .
and in africa , where most of our peacekeepers are deployed , the proportion drops to less than one in 20 . "
ireland as example annan said he hoped other european nations would follow the lead of ireland , which is bucking the trend with its troop contingent in liberia .

" darfur is an enormous region and a huge number of people are suffering .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .

shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .
the company has already invested almost € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in libya with what it has described as positive results . the two dozen german business representatives accompanying the chancellor on his trip are eager to network in a country with great economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed tripoli internet cafe " libya is a small yet underdeveloped market , " jochen clausnitzer , the middle east expert at the association of german chambers of commerce and inudustrie , told dw-radio .

" let ’ s not lie to the turkish people -lsb- but -rsb- say clearly that membership of the eu is not going to be possible today , tomorrow or in the next years , " he added .
" turkey remains very far from europe today , politically , economically and socially . "
however , he warned against a premature ' no ' to turkish accession emphasizing that the french people would have the " last word " on the issue .
french president jacques chirac has promised a referendum on any future enlargement of the eu .
the debate comes after mounting political pressure to allow mps to vote on the issue of turkey joining the eu .
raffarin has not permitted a vote due to " political and legal reasons . "
and most parties are split on the issue .
many mps in the ruling centre-right ump party have grave misgivings about allowing turkey into the union but chirac -lrb- also ump -rrb- is in favor .
similarly , the opposition socialists are divided , with deputy leader laurent fabius yesterday arguing for a " privileged partnership " with ankara .
but if politicians are divided on the subject , the view of the french people seems clear enough .
a recent poll showed that three quarters of them would vote against turkey entering the eu if a vote were held now .
the french debate comes a week after brussels declared turkey ready to start accession negotiations .
eu leaders will decide whether they agree on december 17 . www-links eu observer the latest eu-related news more briefs 14.10.2004 -pipe- italy and germany still at odds over un 14.10.2004 -pipe- waiting game on new commission 14.10.2004 -pipe- bolkestein : eu of 40 inevitable 12.10.2004 -pipe- russia and us least popular g8 countries globally 12.10.2004 -pipe- cyprus threatens to veto turkey 11.10.2004 -pipe- french socialists set rules for eu constitution vote 11.10.2004 -pipe- fresh bid to reach economic goals 11.10.2004 -pipe- euro brought stability , but not growth , says commissioner radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .

shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .

in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .

if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .

shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .
the company has already invested almost € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in libya with what it has described as positive results . the two dozen german business representatives accompanying the chancellor on his trip are eager to network in a country with great economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed tripoli internet cafe " libya is a small yet underdeveloped market , " jochen clausnitzer , the middle east expert at the association of german chambers of commerce and inudustrie , told dw-radio .
" so there is plenty of opportunity in the country . " clausnitzer said the country has an estimated $ 20 billion in currency reserves , built with the help of high oil prices , just waiting to be spent on various projects . " the prospects are rather bright for german companies , " he said . oil potential massive us oil companies and their competitors from france and england have already been itching to get back into oil fields sanctions forced them to abandon decades ago .

the country 's potential is estimated at 47 billion barrels of oil . much work is already being done to improve the country 's archaic oil infrastructure .
the 1.4 million barrels the industry currently produces should be increased to 2 million in the coming years . german companies , far from world leaders in the oil business , are looking to get a piece of the pie in other areas .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .
a court freed her under pressure from eu officials who said she had not received a fair trial . an appeals court is currently reviewing the case . implementation still ' cosmetic ' speaking partly in turkish and partly in kurdish - a language whose public use was long banned in turkey - zana , a former pro-kurdish lawmaker , called on turkey thursday for dialogue between cultures and greater rights for turkey 's minority kurds . " violence has outlived its time , " zana told the european union assembly .
" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .
it is not ' die and kill , ' but ' live and let live ' . " she said efforts to improve human rights in order to meet european union criteria would otherwise be meaningless . " significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy .
but the implementation of these steps still seems cosmetic , " zana said .
" the copenhagen criteria must be implemented in essence and not just in words . " an uneasy relationship the first kurdish woman ever to serve in the turkish parliament , zana took her parliamentary oath in 1991 .
but when she insisted on speaking kurdish , turkey was outraged .
she and three other lawmakers were later barred from the assembly .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .

" i want to leave you in no doubt of how important strengthened eu capacities are to the united nations , " kofi annan said during an address on eu-un cooperation in crisis management at the forum on europe at dublin castle .
" the eu is in a position to provide specialized skills that our largest troop contributors may not be able to give us , and to deploy more rapidly than we can , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan " the eu and its member states pay a lot of the un 's bills , and support our work right across the spectrum .
i am deeply grateful for that - but i look to europe for even more .
that 's why i welcome the development of eu capabilities in the context of the european security and defense policy , and the progress that we are making together in the field of crisis management . "
european proposal the european union wants to set up rapid-reaction battle groups for troublespots around the globe but acknowledges a chronic lack of key military equipment stands in its way .
britain , france and germany have proposed establishing two or three units of 1,500 troops each by next year .
by 2007 there may be as many as nine groups in a standing rota that could be deployed within 10 days .

2003 in bunia , congo .
their most likely use would be to restore order or stabilise a crisis zone and fill a crucial gap of up to three months until a u.n. peacekeeping force can be deployed , as a french-led eu force did in bunia , eastern congo , last year .
the move has been officially welcomed by the nato alliance , which last year formed its own 20,000-strong rapid response force .
the un secretary-general noted many people were alive today because of the french-led operation artemis in the congo , which in turn handed over to a un operation .
he called artemis a model of eu cooperation with the un .
greater demand annan said the un is facing a surge in demand for peacekeeping and the european security and defence policy must not mean a weakening of the commitment of eu member states to provide traditional blue-helmeted troops for un missions .
" in the last nine months , with five new operations either deployed or on the drawing board , the demand on our peacekeeping has jumped by about 50 percent , " he said .
" we have around 56,000 troops and military observers deployed today .
but we desperately need another 30,000 of them - not to mention many more civilian personnel , both police and others , " he said .
" yet today , less than one in 10 un peacekeepers is from an eu country .
and in africa , where most of our peacekeepers are deployed , the proportion drops to less than one in 20 . "
ireland as example annan said he hoped other european nations would follow the lead of ireland , which is bucking the trend with its troop contingent in liberia .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .
a court freed her under pressure from eu officials who said she had not received a fair trial . an appeals court is currently reviewing the case . implementation still ' cosmetic ' speaking partly in turkish and partly in kurdish - a language whose public use was long banned in turkey - zana , a former pro-kurdish lawmaker , called on turkey thursday for dialogue between cultures and greater rights for turkey 's minority kurds . " violence has outlived its time , " zana told the european union assembly .
" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .
it is not ' die and kill , ' but ' live and let live ' . " she said efforts to improve human rights in order to meet european union criteria would otherwise be meaningless . " significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy .
but the implementation of these steps still seems cosmetic , " zana said .
" the copenhagen criteria must be implemented in essence and not just in words . " an uneasy relationship the first kurdish woman ever to serve in the turkish parliament , zana took her parliamentary oath in 1991 .
but when she insisted on speaking kurdish , turkey was outraged .
she and three other lawmakers were later barred from the assembly .
then , in 1994 , she was jailed for alleged ties to kurdish separatists . over 30,000 people died in the early 1990s , when kurdish rebels fought for an ethnic homeland in south-eastern turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover .
turkey 's 12 million kurds have long had an uneasy relationship with the turkish state , which cracked down on kurdish expressions of culture , fearful of separatist tendencies . although bans on kurdish broadcasting and education have been largely lifted during turkey 's drive to join the eu , use of the language is still heavily regulated .
zana stressed thursday that ankara still has a long way ahead of it . resolving the kurdish issue in brussels one week after the european commission presented its opinion on whether turkey has met the conditions for opening eu membership talks , she urged the turkish government to remove restrictions on the kurdish population . " the turkish government must put on its agenda the democratic solution to the kurdish issue by giving it a proper name , " she said . " everything that is not given a name and not defined is without identity , " she argued .
" every living thing on earth has a name .
it is only the kurds who do not have a name , " she told the 732-member assembly , which gave her speech a standing ovation .
" there is no reason for not defining the issue , and there is no reason for fearing dialogue and peace , " she said .
" the kurds are firmly resolved to introduce a peaceful solution within turkey 's territories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.10.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc eurozone faces " clouds on the horizon " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said friday the eurozone could grow at a faster rate in 2005 than in 2004 but warned that the economy still faced " clouds on the horizon . "
addressing an economic conference , alumnia highlighted the negative impact of rising oil prices on inflation and thus on economic growth .
but he noted that inflation was still " low and near " the eurozone target of just under two percent .
the eu statistics office eurostat reported thursday that the eurozone economy grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months this year and was up 2 percent year-on-year .
the european commission meanwhile left its forecasts for eurozone growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 unchanged at between 0.3 and 0.7 percent .
for the full year 2004 the commission sees growth of about 2 percent .
almunia added that eurozone economic growth was still predicted to be 2.3 percent in 2005 but acknowledged that it could be somewhat softer . dw-world.de eurozone data shows german growth gain eurozone indicators to be released in the coming week show the region 's economy continuing to grow at a steady pace in the second quarter .
despite recent negative reports , berlin appears to be improving slightly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.10.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc eurozone faces " clouds on the horizon " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said friday the eurozone could grow at a faster rate in 2005 than in 2004 but warned that the economy still faced " clouds on the horizon . "
addressing an economic conference , alumnia highlighted the negative impact of rising oil prices on inflation and thus on economic growth .
but he noted that inflation was still " low and near " the eurozone target of just under two percent .
the eu statistics office eurostat reported thursday that the eurozone economy grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months this year and was up 2 percent year-on-year .
the european commission meanwhile left its forecasts for eurozone growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 unchanged at between 0.3 and 0.7 percent .
for the full year 2004 the commission sees growth of about 2 percent .
almunia added that eurozone economic growth was still predicted to be 2.3 percent in 2005 but acknowledged that it could be somewhat softer . dw-world.de eurozone data shows german growth gain eurozone indicators to be released in the coming week show the region 's economy continuing to grow at a steady pace in the second quarter .
despite recent negative reports , berlin appears to be improving slightly .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .
a court freed her under pressure from eu officials who said she had not received a fair trial . an appeals court is currently reviewing the case . implementation still ' cosmetic ' speaking partly in turkish and partly in kurdish - a language whose public use was long banned in turkey - zana , a former pro-kurdish lawmaker , called on turkey thursday for dialogue between cultures and greater rights for turkey 's minority kurds . " violence has outlived its time , " zana told the european union assembly .
" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .
it is not ' die and kill , ' but ' live and let live ' . " she said efforts to improve human rights in order to meet european union criteria would otherwise be meaningless . " significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy .
but the implementation of these steps still seems cosmetic , " zana said .
" the copenhagen criteria must be implemented in essence and not just in words . " an uneasy relationship the first kurdish woman ever to serve in the turkish parliament , zana took her parliamentary oath in 1991 .
but when she insisted on speaking kurdish , turkey was outraged .
she and three other lawmakers were later barred from the assembly .
then , in 1994 , she was jailed for alleged ties to kurdish separatists . over 30,000 people died in the early 1990s , when kurdish rebels fought for an ethnic homeland in south-eastern turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover .
turkey 's 12 million kurds have long had an uneasy relationship with the turkish state , which cracked down on kurdish expressions of culture , fearful of separatist tendencies . although bans on kurdish broadcasting and education have been largely lifted during turkey 's drive to join the eu , use of the language is still heavily regulated .
zana stressed thursday that ankara still has a long way ahead of it . resolving the kurdish issue in brussels one week after the european commission presented its opinion on whether turkey has met the conditions for opening eu membership talks , she urged the turkish government to remove restrictions on the kurdish population . " the turkish government must put on its agenda the democratic solution to the kurdish issue by giving it a proper name , " she said . " everything that is not given a name and not defined is without identity , " she argued .
" every living thing on earth has a name .
it is only the kurds who do not have a name , " she told the 732-member assembly , which gave her speech a standing ovation .
" there is no reason for not defining the issue , and there is no reason for fearing dialogue and peace , " she said .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .
since she started with laugh yoga , abels said she ’ s enjoyed life more and worried less . " life would be a lot easier if people laughed more , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness begins after work longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?
in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ?

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support .

once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .

shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.10.2004 schröder joins the libya fan club großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the west 's good books : libyan leader moammar gadhafi since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .
thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .
11 . the ban was initially put in place because of the country 's role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 bombing of a pan am flight over lockerbie , scotland and an explosion at the " la belle " disco in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- that killed three . after the rapprochement with the us earlier this year , libya smoothed its ties with germany by agreeing to pay $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.3 million -rrb- in compensation to the victims of the disco attack .
shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .
the company has already invested almost € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in libya with what it has described as positive results . the two dozen german business representatives accompanying the chancellor on his trip are eager to network in a country with great economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed tripoli internet cafe " libya is a small yet underdeveloped market , " jochen clausnitzer , the middle east expert at the association of german chambers of commerce and inudustrie , told dw-radio .
" so there is plenty of opportunity in the country . " clausnitzer said the country has an estimated $ 20 billion in currency reserves , built with the help of high oil prices , just waiting to be spent on various projects . " the prospects are rather bright for german companies , " he said . oil potential massive us oil companies and their competitors from france and england have already been itching to get back into oil fields sanctions forced them to abandon decades ago .
on jan .

the country 's potential is estimated at 47 billion barrels of oil . much work is already being done to improve the country 's archaic oil infrastructure .
the 1.4 million barrels the industry currently produces should be increased to 2 million in the coming years . german companies , far from world leaders in the oil business , are looking to get a piece of the pie in other areas .
the government in august helped them by re-instituting government-backed export guarantees for companies looking to invest in the north african country .
the resumption of the guarantees has already caused bilateral trade to jump 12 percent this year , to € 600 million -lrb- $ 742 million -rrb- this year . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lifts arms ban against libya the european union agreed monday to lift an 18-year-old arms embargo on libya , welcoming the country 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and movement towards " responsible government .

he called on gadhafi to continue a course of moving towards a social market economy and added that germany supported libya 's desire to join the world trade organization . during their first meeting that also took place in a traditional bedouin tent outside tripoli on thursday , schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi had clashed over iraq . gadhafi , who reaffirmed his stance against terrorism , blamed the united states for the continuing violence there and called for us troops to withdraw .
he told schröder that the eu and arab countries should unite to counter the us as a superpower .
schröder rejected that idea and expressed doubts over the wisdom of a sudden pullout , a german official said . the two men were also at odds over the us role in the middle east . compensation opens doors however they agreed on the importance of developing relations between germany and libya following a deal last month for libya to pay compensation to 168 mainly german survivors of an attack on a berlin nightclub . libyan foreign minister abdelraham shalgham told reporters thursday that schröder 's trip was " very important for the development of relations with western states , especially with germany .

both sides agreed to consider how to resolve this problem and german companies could be involved in the mine-clearing , the official said . libya was welcomed back into the international community late last year after announcing it was abandoning attempts to develop nuclear , biological and chemical weapons . schröder was expected to arrive in algeria late on friday for the second and last leg of his north africa trip . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .

karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .
the state is n't suited to repair broken business ; note the example of philipp holzmann .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german carmakers face a bumpy ride german auto industry at risk peter hartz : the father of germany 's labor reforms 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen volkswagen heading for bumpy 2004 ride europe -pipe- 15.10.2004 opinion : blame the managers , not the country großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for a change at opel ?
karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .
the state is n't suited to repair broken business ; note the example of philipp holzmann .
in that case , german chancellor gerhard could only put off the building concern 's ultimate breakdown , it could n't prevent it . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

" we 've done it .
agreement has been reached , " karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said after 29 hours of talks . the cost-cutting measures are designed to save € 760 million -lrb- $ 941 million -rrb- at the department store chain .
but 5,500 jobs would also have to be cut in the next three years in order to secure the company 's survival , and negotiators agreed to a three-year pay freeze . " i think that this sum was worth it when you think that we were able to take away the fear of losing a job from 100,000 people , " said franziska wiethold , chief negotiator for the union ver.di , which represents karstadtquelle employees . company chairman christoph achenbach spoke of a giant step in the right direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german carmakers face a bumpy ride german auto industry at risk peter hartz : the father of germany 's labor reforms 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen volkswagen heading for bumpy 2004 ride europe -pipe- 15.10.2004 opinion : blame the managers , not the country großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for a change at opel ?
karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.10.2004 germans have the last laugh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans really a nation of scowling sourpusses ?
could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .
11 . the ban was initially put in place because of the country 's role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 bombing of a pan am flight over lockerbie , scotland and an explosion at the " la belle " disco in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- that killed three . after the rapprochement with the us earlier this year , libya smoothed its ties with germany by agreeing to pay $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.3 million -rrb- in compensation to the victims of the disco attack .
shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .
the company has already invested almost € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in libya with what it has described as positive results . the two dozen german business representatives accompanying the chancellor on his trip are eager to network in a country with great economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed tripoli internet cafe " libya is a small yet underdeveloped market , " jochen clausnitzer , the middle east expert at the association of german chambers of commerce and inudustrie , told dw-radio .
" so there is plenty of opportunity in the country . " clausnitzer said the country has an estimated $ 20 billion in currency reserves , built with the help of high oil prices , just waiting to be spent on various projects . " the prospects are rather bright for german companies , " he said . oil potential massive us oil companies and their competitors from france and england have already been itching to get back into oil fields sanctions forced them to abandon decades ago .
on jan .
10 , 2005 , the libyan oil ministry will hand out 15 licenses for new drilling fields in the country .
the country 's potential is estimated at 47 billion barrels of oil . much work is already being done to improve the country 's archaic oil infrastructure .
the 1.4 million barrels the industry currently produces should be increased to 2 million in the coming years . german companies , far from world leaders in the oil business , are looking to get a piece of the pie in other areas .
the government in august helped them by re-instituting government-backed export guarantees for companies looking to invest in the north african country .
the resumption of the guarantees has already caused bilateral trade to jump 12 percent this year , to € 600 million -lrb- $ 742 million -rrb- this year . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lifts arms ban against libya the european union agreed monday to lift an 18-year-old arms embargo on libya , welcoming the country 's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction and movement towards " responsible government .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "

smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .
a court freed her under pressure from eu officials who said she had not received a fair trial . an appeals court is currently reviewing the case . implementation still ' cosmetic ' speaking partly in turkish and partly in kurdish - a language whose public use was long banned in turkey - zana , a former pro-kurdish lawmaker , called on turkey thursday for dialogue between cultures and greater rights for turkey 's minority kurds . " violence has outlived its time , " zana told the european union assembly .
" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .
it is not ' die and kill , ' but ' live and let live ' . " she said efforts to improve human rights in order to meet european union criteria would otherwise be meaningless . " significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy .
but the implementation of these steps still seems cosmetic , " zana said .
" the copenhagen criteria must be implemented in essence and not just in words . " an uneasy relationship the first kurdish woman ever to serve in the turkish parliament , zana took her parliamentary oath in 1991 .
but when she insisted on speaking kurdish , turkey was outraged .
she and three other lawmakers were later barred from the assembly .

turkey 's 12 million kurds have long had an uneasy relationship with the turkish state , which cracked down on kurdish expressions of culture , fearful of separatist tendencies . although bans on kurdish broadcasting and education have been largely lifted during turkey 's drive to join the eu , use of the language is still heavily regulated .
zana stressed thursday that ankara still has a long way ahead of it . resolving the kurdish issue in brussels one week after the european commission presented its opinion on whether turkey has met the conditions for opening eu membership talks , she urged the turkish government to remove restrictions on the kurdish population . " the turkish government must put on its agenda the democratic solution to the kurdish issue by giving it a proper name , " she said . " everything that is not given a name and not defined is without identity , " she argued .
" every living thing on earth has a name .
it is only the kurds who do not have a name , " she told the 732-member assembly , which gave her speech a standing ovation .
" there is no reason for not defining the issue , and there is no reason for fearing dialogue and peace , " she said .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .
11 . the ban was initially put in place because of the country 's role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 bombing of a pan am flight over lockerbie , scotland and an explosion at the " la belle " disco in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- that killed three . after the rapprochement with the us earlier this year , libya smoothed its ties with germany by agreeing to pay $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.3 million -rrb- in compensation to the victims of the disco attack .
shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .
while gadhafi pointed out that libya 's mines have claimed many lives over the last decades , schöder insisted that given the promising turn german-libyan relations have now taken , it would be wrong to concentrate on the past . improving german-libyan relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle bombing on april 5 , 1986 gadhafi 's unexpected turn-about was recently consolidated when the european union lifted its 18-year arms embargo against the country on oct .
11 . the ban was initially put in place because of the country 's role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1988 bombing of a pan am flight over lockerbie , scotland and an explosion at the " la belle " disco in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- that killed three . after the rapprochement with the us earlier this year , libya smoothed its ties with germany by agreeing to pay $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.3 million -rrb- in compensation to the victims of the disco attack .
shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .

of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .
since she started with laugh yoga , abels said she ’ s enjoyed life more and worried less . " life would be a lot easier if people laughed more , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness begins after work longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .

shortly afterwards , schröder announced his visit .
" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .

he called on gadhafi to continue a course of moving towards a social market economy and added that germany supported libya 's desire to join the world trade organization . during their first meeting that also took place in a traditional bedouin tent outside tripoli on thursday , schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi had clashed over iraq . gadhafi , who reaffirmed his stance against terrorism , blamed the united states for the continuing violence there and called for us troops to withdraw .
he told schröder that the eu and arab countries should unite to counter the us as a superpower .
schröder rejected that idea and expressed doubts over the wisdom of a sudden pullout , a german official said . the two men were also at odds over the us role in the middle east . compensation opens doors however they agreed on the importance of developing relations between germany and libya following a deal last month for libya to pay compensation to 168 mainly german survivors of an attack on a berlin nightclub . libyan foreign minister abdelraham shalgham told reporters thursday that schröder 's trip was " very important for the development of relations with western states , especially with germany . " aside from the politics of the visit , schröder is accompanied by 25 leaders of german industry who are seeking business in the north african state . the chancellor said at the opening ceremony that the rebuilding of libya 's infrastructure " offered great opportunities " for german industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the wintershall oil drilling well schröder spent friday morning opening an oil drilling well operated by german company wintershall in the desert hundreds of kilometers south of tripoli . the company supplies oil from five libyan inland fields as well as an offshore drilling platform . " libya is one of the crucial targeted areas , " said wintershall chairman reinier zwitserloot . gadhafi to come to berlin schröder , the first post-war german chancellor to visit libya , is scheduled to meet gadhafi again later friday when he is expected to push him to cooperate more fully in the international war on terrorism . gadhafi also accepted an invitation from schröder to visit germany , a german official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi and berlusconi on oct .

in addition to the berlin pay-out , tripoli has also paid damages to the relatives of people killed in the bombing of a pan am jet over lockerbie , scotland , in 1988 , and it reached agreements in january over a french airliner blown up a year later . schröder 's trip comes during a week in which the european union lifted an arms embargo against libya , and follows a visit last weekend by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- . help in mine-cleaning in other issues raised in their first meeting , gadhafi told schröder he expected assistance from germany in removing the landmines laid in libya by nazi forces during world war ii .
both sides agreed to consider how to resolve this problem and german companies could be involved in the mine-clearing , the official said . libya was welcomed back into the international community late last year after announcing it was abandoning attempts to develop nuclear , biological and chemical weapons . schröder was expected to arrive in algeria late on friday for the second and last leg of his north africa trip . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

he is accused of being " one of the key figures of the al-qaeda terrorist network and providing logistical and financial support for this organization since 1997 in spain , germany and britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.10.2004 germans have the last laugh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans really a nation of scowling sourpusses ?
could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .
since she started with laugh yoga , abels said she ’ s enjoyed life more and worried less . " life would be a lot easier if people laughed more , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness begins after work longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?

" i want to leave you in no doubt of how important strengthened eu capacities are to the united nations , " kofi annan said during an address on eu-un cooperation in crisis management at the forum on europe at dublin castle .
" the eu is in a position to provide specialized skills that our largest troop contributors may not be able to give us , and to deploy more rapidly than we can , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan " the eu and its member states pay a lot of the un 's bills , and support our work right across the spectrum .
i am deeply grateful for that - but i look to europe for even more .
that 's why i welcome the development of eu capabilities in the context of the european security and defense policy , and the progress that we are making together in the field of crisis management . "
european proposal the european union wants to set up rapid-reaction battle groups for troublespots around the globe but acknowledges a chronic lack of key military equipment stands in its way .
britain , france and germany have proposed establishing two or three units of 1,500 troops each by next year .
by 2007 there may be as many as nine groups in a standing rota that could be deployed within 10 days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers position themselves outside the un compound , saturday , june 7 .
2003 in bunia , congo .
their most likely use would be to restore order or stabilise a crisis zone and fill a crucial gap of up to three months until a u.n. peacekeeping force can be deployed , as a french-led eu force did in bunia , eastern congo , last year .
the move has been officially welcomed by the nato alliance , which last year formed its own 20,000-strong rapid response force .
the un secretary-general noted many people were alive today because of the french-led operation artemis in the congo , which in turn handed over to a un operation .
he called artemis a model of eu cooperation with the un .
greater demand annan said the un is facing a surge in demand for peacekeeping and the european security and defence policy must not mean a weakening of the commitment of eu member states to provide traditional blue-helmeted troops for un missions .
" in the last nine months , with five new operations either deployed or on the drawing board , the demand on our peacekeeping has jumped by about 50 percent , " he said .
" we have around 56,000 troops and military observers deployed today .
but we desperately need another 30,000 of them - not to mention many more civilian personnel , both police and others , " he said .
" yet today , less than one in 10 un peacekeepers is from an eu country .
and in africa , where most of our peacekeepers are deployed , the proportion drops to less than one in 20 . "
ireland as example annan said he hoped other european nations would follow the lead of ireland , which is bucking the trend with its troop contingent in liberia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a displaced sudanese family at the market in riyadh internally displaced people 's camp , outside el geneina , in western darfur , sudan .
dealing with the crisis in the darfur region of sudan , annan stressed that much more help was needed .
" darfur is an enormous region and a huge number of people are suffering .
the humanitarian effort needs more money , " he said .

he called on gadhafi to continue a course of moving towards a social market economy and added that germany supported libya 's desire to join the world trade organization . during their first meeting that also took place in a traditional bedouin tent outside tripoli on thursday , schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi had clashed over iraq . gadhafi , who reaffirmed his stance against terrorism , blamed the united states for the continuing violence there and called for us troops to withdraw .
he told schröder that the eu and arab countries should unite to counter the us as a superpower .
schröder rejected that idea and expressed doubts over the wisdom of a sudden pullout , a german official said . the two men were also at odds over the us role in the middle east . compensation opens doors however they agreed on the importance of developing relations between germany and libya following a deal last month for libya to pay compensation to 168 mainly german survivors of an attack on a berlin nightclub . libyan foreign minister abdelraham shalgham told reporters thursday that schröder 's trip was " very important for the development of relations with western states , especially with germany . " aside from the politics of the visit , schröder is accompanied by 25 leaders of german industry who are seeking business in the north african state . the chancellor said at the opening ceremony that the rebuilding of libya 's infrastructure " offered great opportunities " for german industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the wintershall oil drilling well schröder spent friday morning opening an oil drilling well operated by german company wintershall in the desert hundreds of kilometers south of tripoli . the company supplies oil from five libyan inland fields as well as an offshore drilling platform .

he called on gadhafi to continue a course of moving towards a social market economy and added that germany supported libya 's desire to join the world trade organization . during their first meeting that also took place in a traditional bedouin tent outside tripoli on thursday , schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi had clashed over iraq . gadhafi , who reaffirmed his stance against terrorism , blamed the united states for the continuing violence there and called for us troops to withdraw .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .

the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .

on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.10.2004 germans have the last laugh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans really a nation of scowling sourpusses ?
could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .
since she started with laugh yoga , abels said she ’ s enjoyed life more and worried less . " life would be a lot easier if people laughed more , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness begins after work longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country .

" i want to leave you in no doubt of how important strengthened eu capacities are to the united nations , " kofi annan said during an address on eu-un cooperation in crisis management at the forum on europe at dublin castle .
" the eu is in a position to provide specialized skills that our largest troop contributors may not be able to give us , and to deploy more rapidly than we can , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan " the eu and its member states pay a lot of the un 's bills , and support our work right across the spectrum .
i am deeply grateful for that - but i look to europe for even more .
that 's why i welcome the development of eu capabilities in the context of the european security and defense policy , and the progress that we are making together in the field of crisis management . "
european proposal the european union wants to set up rapid-reaction battle groups for troublespots around the globe but acknowledges a chronic lack of key military equipment stands in its way .
britain , france and germany have proposed establishing two or three units of 1,500 troops each by next year .
by 2007 there may be as many as nine groups in a standing rota that could be deployed within 10 days .

2003 in bunia , congo .
their most likely use would be to restore order or stabilise a crisis zone and fill a crucial gap of up to three months until a u.n. peacekeeping force can be deployed , as a french-led eu force did in bunia , eastern congo , last year .
the move has been officially welcomed by the nato alliance , which last year formed its own 20,000-strong rapid response force .
the un secretary-general noted many people were alive today because of the french-led operation artemis in the congo , which in turn handed over to a un operation .
he called artemis a model of eu cooperation with the un .
greater demand annan said the un is facing a surge in demand for peacekeeping and the european security and defence policy must not mean a weakening of the commitment of eu member states to provide traditional blue-helmeted troops for un missions .
" in the last nine months , with five new operations either deployed or on the drawing board , the demand on our peacekeeping has jumped by about 50 percent , " he said .
" we have around 56,000 troops and military observers deployed today .
but we desperately need another 30,000 of them - not to mention many more civilian personnel , both police and others , " he said .
" yet today , less than one in 10 un peacekeepers is from an eu country .
and in africa , where most of our peacekeepers are deployed , the proportion drops to less than one in 20 . "
ireland as example annan said he hoped other european nations would follow the lead of ireland , which is bucking the trend with its troop contingent in liberia .

dealing with the crisis in the darfur region of sudan , annan stressed that much more help was needed .
" darfur is an enormous region and a huge number of people are suffering .
the humanitarian effort needs more money , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.10.2004 germans have the last laugh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans really a nation of scowling sourpusses ?
could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .

thursday saw germany 's chancellor begin a two-day visit intended to strengthen economic ties between the countries . with only one five-star hotel in the country , some speculated whether libyan leader moammar gadhafi would be pitching one of his trademark luxurious tents for gerhard schröder .
the occasion is certainly a special one .
after a series of concessions and policy changes made by gadhafi 's government in the past year , this is the first time the german leader is visiting the country . " the change of his politics is really remarkable , " schröder told reporters at tripoli airport thursday evening , adding that the libyan government 's new course deserves " every support . " during thursday evening 's three-hour banquet in gadhafi 's bab al azizia compound , schröder invited his host to visit germany - a gesture underscoring berlin 's willingness to welcome libya back into the international fold . a westward-looking despot the gadhafi that schröder met is by no means the same man who railed against the west during his long reign as libya 's leader .
once the target of us bombs in the 1980s , gadhafi has gone from preaching a middle road between capitalism and communism to one of the middle east 's most westward-looking despots . his announcement in december 2003 that libya would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs was a massive step towards thawing relations with the united states . nonetheless , according to government sources , gadhafi allegedly stressed during thursday 's talks that improving arab-european ties was an important and necessary means of creating a counter-weight to us-dominance within the international community - a call rejected by schröder , who emphasized that germany valued its favorable relationships with both the us and russia . the talks also included discussion of libya 's demand for german compensation for mines laid in the north african country during world war ii .

" it 's about taking this positive development and making it irreversible , " government sources told news agency afp . chancellor brings company but the main focus of schröder 's visit is clearly business . early on friday , he headed into the libyan desert to visit a new wintershall oil and gas exploration project some 1000 kilometers south of tripoli with executives from the german company , which is part of the basf group .
the company has already invested almost € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in libya with what it has described as positive results . the two dozen german business representatives accompanying the chancellor on his trip are eager to network in a country with great economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed tripoli internet cafe " libya is a small yet underdeveloped market , " jochen clausnitzer , the middle east expert at the association of german chambers of commerce and inudustrie , told dw-radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.10.2004 germans have the last laugh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans really a nation of scowling sourpusses ?
could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .
since she started with laugh yoga , abels said she ’ s enjoyed life more and worried less . " life would be a lot easier if people laughed more , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness begins after work longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?

" we wo n't close any factories between now and 2006 .
but after that , we ca n't guarantee anything , " henderson said .
opel 's main sites in rüsselsheim and bochum " are the least competitive , " he added . gm has recently said it wants to build its mid-range saab and opel models at a single plant and that could mean that either the rüsselsheim factory or the saab plant in trollhättan could eventually be shut down .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .
a court freed her under pressure from eu officials who said she had not received a fair trial . an appeals court is currently reviewing the case . implementation still ' cosmetic ' speaking partly in turkish and partly in kurdish - a language whose public use was long banned in turkey - zana , a former pro-kurdish lawmaker , called on turkey thursday for dialogue between cultures and greater rights for turkey 's minority kurds . " violence has outlived its time , " zana told the european union assembly .
" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .
it is not ' die and kill , ' but ' live and let live ' . " she said efforts to improve human rights in order to meet european union criteria would otherwise be meaningless . " significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy .
but the implementation of these steps still seems cosmetic , " zana said .
" the copenhagen criteria must be implemented in essence and not just in words . " an uneasy relationship the first kurdish woman ever to serve in the turkish parliament , zana took her parliamentary oath in 1991 .
but when she insisted on speaking kurdish , turkey was outraged .
she and three other lawmakers were later barred from the assembly .
then , in 1994 , she was jailed for alleged ties to kurdish separatists . over 30,000 people died in the early 1990s , when kurdish rebels fought for an ethnic homeland in south-eastern turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover .
turkey 's 12 million kurds have long had an uneasy relationship with the turkish state , which cracked down on kurdish expressions of culture , fearful of separatist tendencies . although bans on kurdish broadcasting and education have been largely lifted during turkey 's drive to join the eu , use of the language is still heavily regulated .
zana stressed thursday that ankara still has a long way ahead of it . resolving the kurdish issue in brussels one week after the european commission presented its opinion on whether turkey has met the conditions for opening eu membership talks , she urged the turkish government to remove restrictions on the kurdish population . " the turkish government must put on its agenda the democratic solution to the kurdish issue by giving it a proper name , " she said . " everything that is not given a name and not defined is without identity , " she argued .
" every living thing on earth has a name .
it is only the kurds who do not have a name , " she told the 732-member assembly , which gave her speech a standing ovation .
" there is no reason for not defining the issue , and there is no reason for fearing dialogue and peace , " she said .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .
the state is n't suited to repair broken business ; note the example of philipp holzmann .
in that case , german chancellor gerhard could only put off the building concern 's ultimate breakdown , it could n't prevent it . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

he called on gadhafi to continue a course of moving towards a social market economy and added that germany supported libya 's desire to join the world trade organization . during their first meeting that also took place in a traditional bedouin tent outside tripoli on thursday , schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi had clashed over iraq . gadhafi , who reaffirmed his stance against terrorism , blamed the united states for the continuing violence there and called for us troops to withdraw .
he told schröder that the eu and arab countries should unite to counter the us as a superpower .
schröder rejected that idea and expressed doubts over the wisdom of a sudden pullout , a german official said . the two men were also at odds over the us role in the middle east . compensation opens doors however they agreed on the importance of developing relations between germany and libya following a deal last month for libya to pay compensation to 168 mainly german survivors of an attack on a berlin nightclub . libyan foreign minister abdelraham shalgham told reporters thursday that schröder 's trip was " very important for the development of relations with western states , especially with germany .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .
a court freed her under pressure from eu officials who said she had not received a fair trial . an appeals court is currently reviewing the case . implementation still ' cosmetic ' speaking partly in turkish and partly in kurdish - a language whose public use was long banned in turkey - zana , a former pro-kurdish lawmaker , called on turkey thursday for dialogue between cultures and greater rights for turkey 's minority kurds . " violence has outlived its time , " zana told the european union assembly .
" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .
it is not ' die and kill , ' but ' live and let live ' . " she said efforts to improve human rights in order to meet european union criteria would otherwise be meaningless . " significant steps have certainly been taken towards democracy .
but the implementation of these steps still seems cosmetic , " zana said .
" the copenhagen criteria must be implemented in essence and not just in words . " an uneasy relationship the first kurdish woman ever to serve in the turkish parliament , zana took her parliamentary oath in 1991 .
but when she insisted on speaking kurdish , turkey was outraged .
she and three other lawmakers were later barred from the assembly .
then , in 1994 , she was jailed for alleged ties to kurdish separatists . over 30,000 people died in the early 1990s , when kurdish rebels fought for an ethnic homeland in south-eastern turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds demonstrate in hanover .
turkey 's 12 million kurds have long had an uneasy relationship with the turkish state , which cracked down on kurdish expressions of culture , fearful of separatist tendencies . although bans on kurdish broadcasting and education have been largely lifted during turkey 's drive to join the eu , use of the language is still heavily regulated .
zana stressed thursday that ankara still has a long way ahead of it . resolving the kurdish issue in brussels one week after the european commission presented its opinion on whether turkey has met the conditions for opening eu membership talks , she urged the turkish government to remove restrictions on the kurdish population . " the turkish government must put on its agenda the democratic solution to the kurdish issue by giving it a proper name , " she said . " everything that is not given a name and not defined is without identity , " she argued .
" every living thing on earth has a name .
it is only the kurds who do not have a name , " she told the 732-member assembly , which gave her speech a standing ovation .
" there is no reason for not defining the issue , and there is no reason for fearing dialogue and peace , " she said .
" the kurds are firmly resolved to introduce a peaceful solution within turkey 's territories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german carmakers face a bumpy ride german auto industry at risk peter hartz : the father of germany 's labor reforms 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen volkswagen heading for bumpy 2004 ride europe -pipe- 15.10.2004 opinion : blame the managers , not the country großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for a change at opel ?
karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .
the german government stays abreast of the problems , but otherwise stays out of it - which is the right thing to do .
the state is n't suited to repair broken business ; note the example of philipp holzmann .
in that case , german chancellor gerhard could only put off the building concern 's ultimate breakdown , it could n't prevent it . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .
then they leave , irritated , without buying anything .
there is another way - at least in some cases - as exemplified by the top-flight department stores kadewe in berlin and alsterhaus in hamburg .
their top quality goods and excellent service lures customers - and makes a good profit - despite high prices .
ironically kadewe and alsterhaus are karstadt flagship stores .
of course , this business model only works in the really big cities , where there are enough choosy customers who can afford to buy luxury goods .
in small , provincial outlets , this plan would not work .
opel and karstadtquelle have economic problems that are the result of poor decisions on the part of their respective upper management .
with the new cost cutting concepts , the companies have laid the basis for urgently needed restructuring .
unfortunately , thousands of workers will lose their jobs in the process - and the remaining workers will have to work under worse conditions .
those who got the workers into the mess came out of it unharmed .

karstadtquelle will start restructuring ; automaker opel is likely to slash jobs - and some say germany 's business climate is at fault .
dw-radio 's karl zawadzky says do n't blame the country , blame the management . the current crises did n't happen over night .
in fact , they 've been brewing for a long time .
which means that while the responsible manager long ago left the company and has begun to enjoy either his retirement pay or severance package , the workers are being held liable .
when nothing else will work , there is one thing left to do : a full-blown restructuring .
which inevitably means - as in the case of opel and karstadtquelle - lost jobs , longer working hours , and pay cuts for the remaining workers in order to recoup the huge losses .
bearing the brunt the assembly line worker or the salesperson may not have caused the problem , but - sad to say - they have to take the rap for it .
the companies need to lower costs , as quickly and permanently as possible , in order for the banks to extend or raise their credit lines .
the fastest , most effective way to do this is to cut personnel costs .
there is one thing opel and karstadtquelle have in common : they missed development opportunities in their respective areas .
in addition , there are specific problems .
for example , gm subsidiary opel was for many years the cash cow of the world 's largest carmaker .
in germany , it earned billions and jumped in to help when a financial crisis led to the restructuring of the u.s. parent company .
now , the money is lacking on this side of the ocean .
there are real problems at opel , especially in terms of its image and its car models .
the company builds mass-market cars for a middle class public , but these are n't selling well .
because on the one hand , demand is up in the premium auto market , which is bmw , mercedes and porsche , but not for opel .
on the other hand , the middle class is now divided into a number of niche markets , where opel has nothing special to offer .
germany v. poland ?
in addition , the parent company in detroit thinks it knows more about the european car market than the europeans do .
and on top of all that , general motors recently built a very modern car factory in poland , which will be operated along the relatively low polish wage scale .
in terms of internal competition within the firm , then , german plants have a natural disadvantage .
karstadtquelle also made mistakes , which will only be made worse through the changes in their retail strategy .
for years , german consumers have been reluctant to spend , and when they do , then it is increasingly at discount or specialty stores .
in a bid to control costs , they have responded by cutting back personnel and offering a mid-level assortment of goods .
which means in the end that customers wander aimlessly through enormous assortment of wares , without finding anyone to help them .

she had served ten years of that sentence before her release in june this year . widely seen as a prisoner of conscience , her release was viewed as a sign of turkey 's commitment to the legal and political reforms demanded by the european union as terms of its accession .

" the language and method of solution of our age is dialogue , compromise and peace .

a symbolic payment to these people , with survivors estimated at about 2,000 , would be " right and proper " and would be important for the bilateral relations , köhler was quoted as saying in the czech press before his visit to prague on friday .
czech premier stanislav gross has recently said the time is not " ripe " for such a step .
köhler 's call comes after recent comments by german chancellor gerhard schröder who announced last week that the federal government would not support any individual actions for damages before european or national courts .
the president hoped that the move to compensate the sudeten germans would come from the czechs .
" in germany , there exists no political power which would support these claims , " he added . dw-world.de schröder rejects sudeten germans ' claims during a visit to prague on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder refused to back bids by germans expelled from czech territories in 1945 to sue prague for compensation .

could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue . germans are not known for being giggly , bubbly or light-hearted .
nor are they a riot , a hoot , a scream , or barrel of laughs .
they 're not even especially witty .
so why are they hosting a humor conference ?
maybe they just need it most .
if the international stereotype is true , germany is a country full of dour sourpusses who tend toward excessive punctuality - and there is even some data to back it up .
germans laughed three times less in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s - right after the world war ii .
depression rates have increased tenfold .
the head of humor care , a group that promotes laughter 's threapeutic benefits , dr. michael titze , explained that it 's not a chemical imbalance that keeps germans from laughing as much as they used to .
rather , an extreme fear of what the future holds , keeps them crabby .
postmodern angst to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clapping helped germans crack a smile on world laughter day , may 6 , 2001 economic downturns and even fear of natural catastrophes weigh on the teutonic psyche , titze told dw-world . " actual post-modern life is getting more and more serious , " titze said .
" people feel overwhelmed by the choices they have in how to determine their lives , and it ’ s more than some people can handle . "
luckily , the german medical profession - which increasingly recognizes that laughter can help promote good health - is getting into the act .
at the 3rd german humor conference , which started friday in the western german city of essen , medical professionals will get down to clarifying the medical benefits of laughter and the therapies that promote them .
but more important even than research , are the ever expanding practical opportunities for germans looking for a good guffaw .
' fake it till you make it ' from laughter clubs , where people get together to laugh for no reason , to traditional comedy clubs to " laugh yoga , " there are growing opportunities to buck the national trend and smile , smile , smile .
hoho-haha is a cologne-based group that promotes so-called " laugh yoga , " a discipline that trains people to combine laughter with yoga breathing exercises .
" when people begin the two-day seminars we offer , they ca n't just let go with 10 minutes of hearty laughing for no particular reason , " hoho-haha 's brigitte abels told dw-world .
but after completing a two day seminar , participants aim to bust a gut for a full half hour .
" it feels silly and strange at the beginning , " abels said .
" but we say : ‘ fake it till you make it . ’ "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's plenty to laugh about in germany research shows that after 10 minutes of forced laughter , the brain can no longer differentiate between a real or artificial giggle fit and lets loose with all the positive side-effects of authentic laughter , such as bringing down blood pressure , improving circulation , and lowering stress , abels said .
smiling at junkies abels said her laugh yoga practice has also brought more immediate benefits .
" i used to be disturbed by some junkies and beggars who stayed in the park near where i lived , " abels said .
once she became a laugh yogi , though , she learned to look at them and smile - and found that they smiled back .
she hasn ’ t been bothered by them since .
but humor care 's titze said germans don ’ t need to start laugh yoga to cheer up , they just need to stop planning all the details of their lives - a habit often thought to be engraved in the german psyche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt , germany 's best-known comedian according to titze , the more people plan out the future , the less likely they are to laugh about it .
" in countries where people can not plan because they don ’ t know what they will eat tomorrow , there is a measurably higher rate of happiness , " said titze , some of whose patients suffer from gelotophobia - the fear of being laughed at .
standup salvation those who find laugh-yoga too esoteric may feel more comfortable ducking into a comedy club and for a dose of standup schtick .
despite the country 's reputation as being humorless , germany 's cities are home to hundreds of comedy clubs , and the numbers are rising , said peter woller , of the cologne comedy academy .
woller hopes his business , which trains standup comics and helps them book venues , will ensure there are enough good comedians to keep the growing crowds rolling in the aisles .
" there are a lot of venues for comedians in germany , " woller told dw-world .
" i think the quality of german comedy is often underrated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even german finance minister hans eichel can manage a good laugh regardless of whether they go to turn on funny television programs , go to comedy clubs or enroll in laugh yoga , many people " are turning to comedy for a stimulus to help them feel happier , " titze said .

the health protection agency says many of the 6,000 salmonella cases in england and wales since 2002 have been linked to eggs imported from spain .
the beic said it was ridiculous nothing had been done in two years and urged the government to impose an import ban .
but the food standards agency said a ban could only be imposed by europe .
although few eggs are imported into the uk , cheap spanish produce is used by the catering industry . "
we are concerned that so many people have now been affected . "
dr barry evans the hpa has investigated more than 80 outbreaks of food poisoning caused by less common forms of salmonella enteritidis over the past two years , involving at least 2,000 confirmed cases .
but the agency believes the actual number of cases could be three times that number , as most people never report their symptoms .
nearly seven out of ten confirmed cases of the salmonella linked to spanish eggs over the past two years were traced back to restaurants .
an expert group made up of representatives from the hpa , the fsa and others has produced advice designed to limit the potential spread of infection .
importers and wholesalers have been told to ensure spanish eggs that come in powder or large-scale liquid form are commercially heat-treated to kill off the bacteria .
and caterers have been advised to use only pasteurised egg in raw or lightly cooked products .
the team said the elderly , sick or very young should avoid using spanish eggs because they are at greater risk from salmonella .
general advice includes washing and drying hands after touching the outside of eggs , the white or yolk to avoid spreading the bacteria to other food .
serious infection dr barry evans , who chaired the outbreak control team said : " the continuing outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis show that the problem of the contamination of spanish eggs has not been resolved and we are concerned that so many people have now been affected .
" salmonella food poisoning is an unpleasant illness and , although most people make a full recovery , it can be extremely serious for vulnerable groups such as the elderly , babies or people in poor health . "
dr judith hilton , head of microbiological safety at the fsa , added : " salmonella in uk eggs has been steadily decreasing but there is still a particular problem with some spanish eggs .
" since january 2004 , these eggs have had to be marked 'es ' so both caterers and consumers know that they will need to take extra care if they use these eggs , or they may choose to use uk eggs , marked 'uk ' , which we know have far fewer problems .
" we are also pressing the european commission to take further action to tackle this problem . "
andrew parker , of the british egg industry council , said : " it is ridiculous that two years after the problem with spanish eggs first became apparent no action has been taken .
" it is now time for the government to ban spanish eggs . "

the gaming bill would open the way for las vegas-style casinos in the lancashire resort , which has been hit by declining tourism in recent years .
the council 's masterplan , published in 2003 , relies on the bill to help bring in about £ 1.4bn of investment .
the bill aims to help regenerate deprived areas .
reg haslam , head of the masterplan , said : " we have argued strongly that the new law should be used to help regenerate places like blackpool .
" by putting regional casinos in blackpool most people will not have gambling on their doorstep , but we will transform the economy of blackpool and bring clear benefits to the wider north west region , " he added .
' world-class ' the council hopes new gambling laws would help it transform the town into a " 21st century world class resort " .
but mr haslam warned that the northwest regional planning body and northwest development agency would have to help by ensuring that casinos were built in the town rather than elsewhere in the region .
he said : " if they support blackpool we are confident we will succeed .
" however , if they let market forces decide where casinos go then that , in effect , is a decision to allow blackpool to continue to decline . "

last month the council called for all remaining foreign forces to be withdrawn from lebanon .
secretary general kofi annan subsequently made it clear that syria had failed to comply .
syria sent its forces into lebanon in 1976 at the request of beirut .
it still has 14,000 troops in the country .
this latest draft text will keep the pressure on damascus to withdraw them , diplomats at the un say .
it does not name syria , but urges relevant parties to implement the last resolution and notes with concern that the requirements have not been met .
divisions the draft resolution calls on the secretary general to report back to the security council every three months .
this is a subject that divides the security council .
the draft resolution was drawn up after the council failed to agree on a unanimous statement about the situation .
the previous resolution was passed by only the minimum nine votes .
the lebanese government has said that while its ultimate goal is the withdrawal of foreign forces , the current fragile security situation makes it difficult to draw up a timetable .
the british ambassador to the un , emyr jones parry , said he expected further meetings on the text in the next few days and a vote after that .

amy cavanagh , from bridgend , called out-of-hours service primecare when her daughter , megan , three , complained of a sore neck and back .
after waiting for a return call , she rang back and says she was told the nearest gp was some 200 miles away .
the local health board and primecare have apologised for the distress .
primecare had taken over out-of-hours calls from ms cavanagh 's gp in brackla five days earlier . "
with the introduction of any new service a period of adjustment is anticipated " bridgend local health board megan was later treated at the university hospital of wales in cardiff , where she was diagnosed with tonsillitis and an ear infection .
a spokesman for the bridgend local health board and primecare admitted that things had gone wrong when mrs cavanagh , 22 , called .
he said : " we are sorry for the distress mrs cavanagh experienced in contacting the out-of-hours gp service .
" clearly the service did not respond as we had planned and expected in this instance and we are working closely with the provider of the service , primecare , to find out exactly what happened . "
he said the service had been swamped with calls on the weekend that megan was ill .
' teething problems ' " the volume of calls last weekend was exceptional - 50 % higher than could , normally , be expected , " he said .
" it is anticipated that , as the system settles down , the number of people calling will revert to normal levels .
" with the introduction of any new service a period of adjustment is anticipated .
" bridgend local health board is working with primecare to iron out teething problems and to ensure the provision of an effective gp out of hours service for all our patients . "
alun cairns said it was " an appalling situation " " as the father of a young child i can only sympathise with her , " he said .
" there needs to be a full and frank inquiry into why this has happened . "
recent changes to gps ' contracts mean responsibility for care during the evenings and weekends has been transferred from gps to local health boards in wales .
gps can opt out of providing cover outside normal hours under their new contracts .
instead , out-of-hours services can be provided by private sector contractors , ambulance trusts or the primary care trusts themselves .
the uk government said on thursday that out-of-hours services would be regularly audited after concerns that new arrangements would mean patients would not get access to a doctor .

a university of san francisco study found only 31 people out of 13,000 could identify in nearly all cases when someone was lying .
the group used facial expressions , body language and ways of talking and thinking to spot liars while the others did little better than chance .
the team are now using them to help train police and other investigators .
in the tests , during which the participants were shown video clips of people , the select group , dubbed wizards , were able to observe a few seconds of footage and detect lying . "
our wizards are attuned to picking up ' micro-expressions ' " dr maureen o 'sullivan , of the university of san francisco the study said the wizards had a " natural talent " although they were highly motivated and tended to be older .
police , lawyers and fbi agents were all among the groups who were unable to tell if people were lying .
the wizards ' success rate was even higher than the traditional polygraph test , which is used in the us and is claimed to have a 60 % to 70 % success rate .
dr maureen o 'sullivan , the university 's professor of psychology , said : " we hope that by studying wizards , we 'll learn more about the kinds of behaviours and ways of thinking and talking that can betray a liar to an experienced interviewer . "
emotions she said that even though people may try to control their expressions , most are not able to keep their feelings from showing on their faces .
" some of the muscles involved in expressions are not under conscious control .
" especially when we feel strong emotions , those expressions appear on our faces , even if only for a fraction of a second .
" our wizards are attuned to picking up ' micro-expressions ' . "
by analysing how the wizards spot liars , dr o 'sullivan 's team has developed a training course to help people become better lie detectors .
the course stresses the importance of emotional clues and cognitive clues , such as inconsistencies in the way people are talking .
but aldert vrij , professor of social psychology at the university of portsmouth , who has written books on lie detection , cast doubt on whether people possessed the ability to spot liars .
" people who lie react differently when they lie so there is no set pattern .
they can feel afraid , guilt or excitement while lying , it really depends on the person .
" and even if a select group are able to tell if people are lying , will they be able to explain how they do it ? "

it might sound like an affair , but what if your " cheating " partner was fast asleep during the act ?
the phenomenon , called sleep sex , was described to doctors at a meeting in australia .
sleep physician peter buchanan , from sydney 's royal alfred hospital , described this real life case .
sleeping partner mr buchanan told the australasian sleep association how a patient of his , who was a respectable middle-aged woman with a steady partner , would leave the house while sleepwalking and have sex with strangers .
the woman was totally unaware of her double life until her partner became suspicious and found her engaged in the act .
" he was aware of some sleepwalking and there was circumstantial evidence , including the unexplained presence of condoms around the house , " mr buchanan told the conference .
mr buchanan ran a series of tests on the woman and diagnosed her problem - sleep sex .
whatever they are dreaming about , which at that time is their reality , they actually do sleep expert neil stanley this is a condition completely distinct from sleepwalking and is a form of sleep disorder called rem behavioural disorder .
normally , when a person enters a phase of sleep called the rem -lrb- rapid eye movement -rrb- phase , in which we can often dream , our bodies are immobilised .
in the case of sleep sex , this does n't happen and the person can act out their dreams .
uk sleep expert neil stanley from the human psychopharmacology research unit at surrey university explained .
reality check " in some people , it can be genetic or in others it is triggered by alcohol or stress , they do not lose the muscle tone .
" so that means whatever they are dreaming about , which at that time is their reality , they actually do . "
he said if what the person was acting out fitted with the dream they might not wake up .
the stages of sleep stage 1 - passed through briefly when falling to sleep stage 2 - most of the sleeping time is spent in this stage stages 3 and 4 - deep sleep , when people can sleepwalk stage 5 - rem sleep , when people can sex sleep " if you are lying there dreaming about having sex with your wife and you just happen to be having sex with your wife then there 's nothing there to stop the dream .
you do n't perceive that as wrong . "
he said there were documented cases where people had committed murders in their sleep .
" there is a case in english law where a guy was beating his girlfriend over the head with a video recorder and she was screaming at him . "
he said the man only woke up when the girlfriend said " i love you " .
" probably that was such a stupid thing in his dream that did not fit that it woke him up .
" it 's like when you hear the phone in the middle of your dream and you wake up . "
he said people would not necessarily remember what they had done while they were dreaming .
" you only remember your dreams if you wake up during them .
" but even then , it can be very difficult to comprehend that you have done what you dreamed about . "
he said finding out what was the trigger of the rem behavioural disorder and eliminating it could help .
other treatments include medications to induce sleep or reduce muscle tone .
mr buchanan said almost half of all sleep sex cases were associated with psychological problems and , in the case of the woman he described , psychotherapy helped .
