chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .

german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .

" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .
" the situation has become more unstable in afghanistan , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2004 ringing in big profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music to the ears - the mobile phones of trendy german teens don ’ t ring so much as sing .
on german music tv channels such as mtv and viva , hardly a commercial break goes by without an ad prompting teens to buy a new ringtone for their mobile phones .
now the music industry is hoping to cash in on the trend . the creative movers and shakers and marketing experts of the german music industry don ’ t have a lot to celebrate at the moment .
one look at their profit figures from last year is enough to dampen the mood .
the nation ’ s association for the recording industry estimates that turnover in 2003 declined by a fifth – a devastating figure . on top of that , the problem with music pirating continues to rob the industry of profits – neither musicians nor producers earn a cent when a song is downloaded illegally .
the industry desperately needs new business ideas . one that ’ s emerged with big money-making potential for the record companies came not from the executives , but the ranks of teens mad for their mobile phones : ringtones .
in england , the market for trendy ringtones that sound like chart-topping hits became serious business in 2003 . according to a report by the bbc , ringtones rang up sales of more than € 100,000 -lrb- $ 127,000 -rrb- . that amount is expected to grow this year . lucrative business ringtones are typically monotone versions of hit songs – simple copies reminiscent of the synthesised sounds of the 1980s , but which are easily played on a mobile phone . customers can order the ringtones via sms , or simply download them from an internet site . a single melody costs around € 2 in germany , with the most trend-conscious teens changing their ringtones at least as often as the number one spot in the charts .
in some cases , a new song title has more sales as a ringtone than it does as a cd single . it ’ s a market that , to the delight of record and mobile phone companies alike , is becoming more and more lucrative in germany . “ in mobile technologies , music is an area that is developing very quickly , and very successfully , ” said vodafone spokeswoman bettina donges .
“ it ’ s something that the music industry has really woken up to . ”
but the channels of sale for ringtones aren ’ t dominated by the music companies .
it ’ s the it and mobile phone companies with their greater technological know-how who ’ ve cleverly stolen a march over the music industry .
t-mobile and vodafone are among the biggest ringtone providers , while bravo.de and jamba.de are leading the way in sales via web sites .
“ we sold 10 million ringtones last year , ” said jamba spokesman tilo bonow .
“ that was a 300 percent increase over the previous year . ”
in 2004 , jamba expects to make even more money . about a third of its € 2 asking price goes to the music industry , and another third to the mobile phone operators . ringtone to realtone t-mobile prefers to keep mum about its sales figures , saying only that it ’ s still in negotiations with music companies . the deutsche telekom division has signed a contract with universal mobile , a division of universal music international , which has signed artists such as the black eyed peas , shaggy , and u2 . through t-mobile , universal hopes to start selling so-called realtones to mobile phone users this year . unlike the monotone ringtones , realtones are the original song – exactly as it ’ s heard on the radio or on cd . they could be the development that sees ringtones break out of the teen market and bring the music industry the big-time profits it ’ s been hoping for . martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry .

t-mobile and vodafone are among the biggest ringtone providers , while bravo.de and jamba.de are leading the way in sales via web sites .
“ we sold 10 million ringtones last year , ” said jamba spokesman tilo bonow .
“ that was a 300 percent increase over the previous year . ”
in 2004 , jamba expects to make even more money . about a third of its € 2 asking price goes to the music industry , and another third to the mobile phone operators . ringtone to realtone t-mobile prefers to keep mum about its sales figures , saying only that it ’ s still in negotiations with music companies . the deutsche telekom division has signed a contract with universal mobile , a division of universal music international , which has signed artists such as the black eyed peas , shaggy , and u2 . through t-mobile , universal hopes to start selling so-called realtones to mobile phone users this year . unlike the monotone ringtones , realtones are the original song – exactly as it ’ s heard on the radio or on cd . they could be the development that sees ringtones break out of the teen market and bring the music industry the big-time profits it ’ s been hoping for . martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .
" highly motivated soldiers " the german troops face there face problems unique to their location and mandate .
kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunduz in northern afghanistan despite the hazards , the germans have been welcomed and first contacts with the local population have been cordial and have gone without any major hitches .
after a stroll through the camp on saturday , struck said he was happy about the " highly motivated " soldiers .
" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .
" the situation has become more unstable in afghanistan , " he said .
" there ’ s a rising danger due to the upcoming elections this year .
that calls for increased alertness and more troop presence , " struck said .
" the taliban will try to disrupt the democratization process . "
no german help in fight against afghan drug trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug trade in afghanistan struck also met with the local army commander in kunduz , general mohammed daud , during his visit .
prior to struck ’ s visit , daud had urged in an interview with german daily financial times deutschland that german troops were also needed to combat the cultivation and sale of opiates such as heroin .
“ drugs are the biggest problem here but the germans haven ’ t done anything , ” khan said , describing narcotics as “ more dangerous than the taliban , ” afghanistan ’ s ousted fundamentalist regime .
“ german soldiers must destroy the opium factories , arrest the dealers and smugglers and reclaim the land where the poppies are cultivated . ”
but struck has said his troops would not help in the war against drug crime .
" that is not our job .
our job is to promote civil reconstruction in the province kunduz and its three neighboring provinces , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karsai applauds isaf expansion it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .

german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .
" for that , we need help , especially from germany , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de georgia 's velvet revolution : new leader urges calm georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2004 struck says afghanistan still not safe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanks are a common sight on streets in afghanistan .
german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .
" highly motivated soldiers " the german troops face there face problems unique to their location and mandate .
kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunduz in northern afghanistan despite the hazards , the germans have been welcomed and first contacts with the local population have been cordial and have gone without any major hitches .
after a stroll through the camp on saturday , struck said he was happy about the " highly motivated " soldiers .
" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .

german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .
" highly motivated soldiers " the german troops face there face problems unique to their location and mandate .
kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .

" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2004 struck says afghanistan still not safe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanks are a common sight on streets in afghanistan .
german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .
" highly motivated soldiers " the german troops face there face problems unique to their location and mandate .
kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunduz in northern afghanistan despite the hazards , the germans have been welcomed and first contacts with the local population have been cordial and have gone without any major hitches .
after a stroll through the camp on saturday , struck said he was happy about the " highly motivated " soldiers .
" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .

german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .
" highly motivated soldiers " the german troops face there face problems unique to their location and mandate .
kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunduz in northern afghanistan despite the hazards , the germans have been welcomed and first contacts with the local population have been cordial and have gone without any major hitches .
after a stroll through the camp on saturday , struck said he was happy about the " highly motivated " soldiers .
" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .
" the situation has become more unstable in afghanistan , " he said .
" there ’ s a rising danger due to the upcoming elections this year .
that calls for increased alertness and more troop presence , " struck said .
" the taliban will try to disrupt the democratization process . "

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .
" for that , we need help , especially from germany , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de georgia 's velvet revolution : new leader urges calm georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests .

german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .
" highly motivated soldiers " the german troops face there face problems unique to their location and mandate .
kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunduz in northern afghanistan despite the hazards , the germans have been welcomed and first contacts with the local population have been cordial and have gone without any major hitches .
after a stroll through the camp on saturday , struck said he was happy about the " highly motivated " soldiers .
" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .
" the situation has become more unstable in afghanistan , " he said .
" there ’ s a rising danger due to the upcoming elections this year .
that calls for increased alertness and more troop presence , " struck said .
" the taliban will try to disrupt the democratization process . "
no german help in fight against afghan drug trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug trade in afghanistan struck also met with the local army commander in kunduz , general mohammed daud , during his visit .
prior to struck ’ s visit , daud had urged in an interview with german daily financial times deutschland that german troops were also needed to combat the cultivation and sale of opiates such as heroin .
“ drugs are the biggest problem here but the germans haven ’ t done anything , ” khan said , describing narcotics as “ more dangerous than the taliban , ” afghanistan ’ s ousted fundamentalist regime .
“ german soldiers must destroy the opium factories , arrest the dealers and smugglers and reclaim the land where the poppies are cultivated . ”

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .

on german music tv channels such as mtv and viva , hardly a commercial break goes by without an ad prompting teens to buy a new ringtone for their mobile phones .
now the music industry is hoping to cash in on the trend . the creative movers and shakers and marketing experts of the german music industry don ’ t have a lot to celebrate at the moment .
one look at their profit figures from last year is enough to dampen the mood .
the nation ’ s association for the recording industry estimates that turnover in 2003 declined by a fifth – a devastating figure . on top of that , the problem with music pirating continues to rob the industry of profits – neither musicians nor producers earn a cent when a song is downloaded illegally .
the industry desperately needs new business ideas . one that ’ s emerged with big money-making potential for the record companies came not from the executives , but the ranks of teens mad for their mobile phones : ringtones .
in england , the market for trendy ringtones that sound like chart-topping hits became serious business in 2003 . according to a report by the bbc , ringtones rang up sales of more than € 100,000 -lrb- $ 127,000 -rrb- . that amount is expected to grow this year . lucrative business ringtones are typically monotone versions of hit songs – simple copies reminiscent of the synthesised sounds of the 1980s , but which are easily played on a mobile phone . customers can order the ringtones via sms , or simply download them from an internet site . a single melody costs around € 2 in germany , with the most trend-conscious teens changing their ringtones at least as often as the number one spot in the charts .
in some cases , a new song title has more sales as a ringtone than it does as a cd single . it ’ s a market that , to the delight of record and mobile phone companies alike , is becoming more and more lucrative in germany . “ in mobile technologies , music is an area that is developing very quickly , and very successfully , ” said vodafone spokeswoman bettina donges .
“ it ’ s something that the music industry has really woken up to . ”
but the channels of sale for ringtones aren ’ t dominated by the music companies .
it ’ s the it and mobile phone companies with their greater technological know-how who ’ ve cleverly stolen a march over the music industry .
t-mobile and vodafone are among the biggest ringtone providers , while bravo.de and jamba.de are leading the way in sales via web sites .
“ we sold 10 million ringtones last year , ” said jamba spokesman tilo bonow .
“ that was a 300 percent increase over the previous year . ”
in 2004 , jamba expects to make even more money . about a third of its € 2 asking price goes to the music industry , and another third to the mobile phone operators . ringtone to realtone t-mobile prefers to keep mum about its sales figures , saying only that it ’ s still in negotiations with music companies . the deutsche telekom division has signed a contract with universal mobile , a division of universal music international , which has signed artists such as the black eyed peas , shaggy , and u2 . through t-mobile , universal hopes to start selling so-called realtones to mobile phone users this year . unlike the monotone ringtones , realtones are the original song – exactly as it ’ s heard on the radio or on cd . they could be the development that sees ringtones break out of the teen market and bring the music industry the big-time profits it ’ s been hoping for . martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .

it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .

“ drugs are the biggest problem here but the germans haven ’ t done anything , ” khan said , describing narcotics as “ more dangerous than the taliban , ” afghanistan ’ s ousted fundamentalist regime .
“ german soldiers must destroy the opium factories , arrest the dealers and smugglers and reclaim the land where the poppies are cultivated . ”

on german music tv channels such as mtv and viva , hardly a commercial break goes by without an ad prompting teens to buy a new ringtone for their mobile phones .
now the music industry is hoping to cash in on the trend . the creative movers and shakers and marketing experts of the german music industry don ’ t have a lot to celebrate at the moment .
one look at their profit figures from last year is enough to dampen the mood .
the nation ’ s association for the recording industry estimates that turnover in 2003 declined by a fifth – a devastating figure . on top of that , the problem with music pirating continues to rob the industry of profits – neither musicians nor producers earn a cent when a song is downloaded illegally .
the industry desperately needs new business ideas . one that ’ s emerged with big money-making potential for the record companies came not from the executives , but the ranks of teens mad for their mobile phones : ringtones .
in england , the market for trendy ringtones that sound like chart-topping hits became serious business in 2003 . according to a report by the bbc , ringtones rang up sales of more than € 100,000 -lrb- $ 127,000 -rrb- . that amount is expected to grow this year . lucrative business ringtones are typically monotone versions of hit songs – simple copies reminiscent of the synthesised sounds of the 1980s , but which are easily played on a mobile phone . customers can order the ringtones via sms , or simply download them from an internet site . a single melody costs around € 2 in germany , with the most trend-conscious teens changing their ringtones at least as often as the number one spot in the charts .
in some cases , a new song title has more sales as a ringtone than it does as a cd single . it ’ s a market that , to the delight of record and mobile phone companies alike , is becoming more and more lucrative in germany . “ in mobile technologies , music is an area that is developing very quickly , and very successfully , ” said vodafone spokeswoman bettina donges .
“ it ’ s something that the music industry has really woken up to . ”
but the channels of sale for ringtones aren ’ t dominated by the music companies .
it ’ s the it and mobile phone companies with their greater technological know-how who ’ ve cleverly stolen a march over the music industry .
t-mobile and vodafone are among the biggest ringtone providers , while bravo.de and jamba.de are leading the way in sales via web sites .
“ we sold 10 million ringtones last year , ” said jamba spokesman tilo bonow .
“ that was a 300 percent increase over the previous year . ”
in 2004 , jamba expects to make even more money . about a third of its € 2 asking price goes to the music industry , and another third to the mobile phone operators . ringtone to realtone t-mobile prefers to keep mum about its sales figures , saying only that it ’ s still in negotiations with music companies . the deutsche telekom division has signed a contract with universal mobile , a division of universal music international , which has signed artists such as the black eyed peas , shaggy , and u2 . through t-mobile , universal hopes to start selling so-called realtones to mobile phone users this year . unlike the monotone ringtones , realtones are the original song – exactly as it ’ s heard on the radio or on cd . they could be the development that sees ringtones break out of the teen market and bring the music industry the big-time profits it ’ s been hoping for . martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .

it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .

“ drugs are the biggest problem here but the germans haven ’ t done anything , ” khan said , describing narcotics as “ more dangerous than the taliban , ” afghanistan ’ s ousted fundamentalist regime .
“ german soldiers must destroy the opium factories , arrest the dealers and smugglers and reclaim the land where the poppies are cultivated . ”

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2004 ringing in big profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music to the ears - the mobile phones of trendy german teens don ’ t ring so much as sing .
on german music tv channels such as mtv and viva , hardly a commercial break goes by without an ad prompting teens to buy a new ringtone for their mobile phones .
now the music industry is hoping to cash in on the trend . the creative movers and shakers and marketing experts of the german music industry don ’ t have a lot to celebrate at the moment .
one look at their profit figures from last year is enough to dampen the mood .
the nation ’ s association for the recording industry estimates that turnover in 2003 declined by a fifth – a devastating figure . on top of that , the problem with music pirating continues to rob the industry of profits – neither musicians nor producers earn a cent when a song is downloaded illegally .
the industry desperately needs new business ideas . one that ’ s emerged with big money-making potential for the record companies came not from the executives , but the ranks of teens mad for their mobile phones : ringtones .
in england , the market for trendy ringtones that sound like chart-topping hits became serious business in 2003 . according to a report by the bbc , ringtones rang up sales of more than € 100,000 -lrb- $ 127,000 -rrb- . that amount is expected to grow this year . lucrative business ringtones are typically monotone versions of hit songs – simple copies reminiscent of the synthesised sounds of the 1980s , but which are easily played on a mobile phone . customers can order the ringtones via sms , or simply download them from an internet site . a single melody costs around € 2 in germany , with the most trend-conscious teens changing their ringtones at least as often as the number one spot in the charts .
in some cases , a new song title has more sales as a ringtone than it does as a cd single . it ’ s a market that , to the delight of record and mobile phone companies alike , is becoming more and more lucrative in germany . “ in mobile technologies , music is an area that is developing very quickly , and very successfully , ” said vodafone spokeswoman bettina donges .
“ it ’ s something that the music industry has really woken up to . ”
but the channels of sale for ringtones aren ’ t dominated by the music companies .
it ’ s the it and mobile phone companies with their greater technological know-how who ’ ve cleverly stolen a march over the music industry .
t-mobile and vodafone are among the biggest ringtone providers , while bravo.de and jamba.de are leading the way in sales via web sites .
“ we sold 10 million ringtones last year , ” said jamba spokesman tilo bonow .
“ that was a 300 percent increase over the previous year . ”
in 2004 , jamba expects to make even more money . about a third of its € 2 asking price goes to the music industry , and another third to the mobile phone operators . ringtone to realtone t-mobile prefers to keep mum about its sales figures , saying only that it ’ s still in negotiations with music companies . the deutsche telekom division has signed a contract with universal mobile , a division of universal music international , which has signed artists such as the black eyed peas , shaggy , and u2 . through t-mobile , universal hopes to start selling so-called realtones to mobile phone users this year . unlike the monotone ringtones , realtones are the original song – exactly as it ’ s heard on the radio or on cd . they could be the development that sees ringtones break out of the teen market and bring the music industry the big-time profits it ’ s been hoping for . martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry .

kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .
also , with a deployment area the size of german states hessen and bavaria put together , the operation finds itself spread over a gigantic area littered with bandits , warlords and resurgent taliban fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunduz in northern afghanistan despite the hazards , the germans have been welcomed and first contacts with the local population have been cordial and have gone without any major hitches .
after a stroll through the camp on saturday , struck said he was happy about the " highly motivated " soldiers .
" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .
" the situation has become more unstable in afghanistan , " he said .
" there ’ s a rising danger due to the upcoming elections this year .
that calls for increased alertness and more troop presence , " struck said .
" the taliban will try to disrupt the democratization process . "
no german help in fight against afghan drug trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug trade in afghanistan struck also met with the local army commander in kunduz , general mohammed daud , during his visit .
prior to struck ’ s visit , daud had urged in an interview with german daily financial times deutschland that german troops were also needed to combat the cultivation and sale of opiates such as heroin .
“ drugs are the biggest problem here but the germans haven ’ t done anything , ” khan said , describing narcotics as “ more dangerous than the taliban , ” afghanistan ’ s ousted fundamentalist regime .
“ german soldiers must destroy the opium factories , arrest the dealers and smugglers and reclaim the land where the poppies are cultivated . ”
but struck has said his troops would not help in the war against drug crime .
" that is not our job .
our job is to promote civil reconstruction in the province kunduz and its three neighboring provinces , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karsai applauds isaf expansion it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .

wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .

the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .

german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- visit on saturday focused on reviewing how the soldiers are coping and how cooperation is progressing between the troops , reconstruction workers and members of local and international aid organizations .

kunduz dominates a vast and remote part of afghanistan , a long way from any rapid assistance .

" up to now , the experiences of our soldiers in kunduz have been positive ones , " struck said in a statement earlier .
" they have not been a target of hatred and have not faced resistance from the population there and we hope that this will remain so . "
struck also met with representatives of afghan authorities and german aid organizations active in the region .
struck warns of increased violence the german defense minister has not ruled out the possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the afghan elections , slated for the middle of the year .
with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2004 germany offers aid to georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikhail saakashwili has promised to clean up his corruption-riddled country .
chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .
he also voiced ambitious plans to steer his country towards the level of a candidate country for the european union in a few years .
" for that , we need help , especially from germany , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de georgia 's velvet revolution : new leader urges calm georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2004 ringing in big profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music to the ears - the mobile phones of trendy german teens don ’ t ring so much as sing .
on german music tv channels such as mtv and viva , hardly a commercial break goes by without an ad prompting teens to buy a new ringtone for their mobile phones .
now the music industry is hoping to cash in on the trend . the creative movers and shakers and marketing experts of the german music industry don ’ t have a lot to celebrate at the moment .
one look at their profit figures from last year is enough to dampen the mood .
the nation ’ s association for the recording industry estimates that turnover in 2003 declined by a fifth – a devastating figure . on top of that , the problem with music pirating continues to rob the industry of profits – neither musicians nor producers earn a cent when a song is downloaded illegally .

in some cases , a new song title has more sales as a ringtone than it does as a cd single . it ’ s a market that , to the delight of record and mobile phone companies alike , is becoming more and more lucrative in germany . “ in mobile technologies , music is an area that is developing very quickly , and very successfully , ” said vodafone spokeswoman bettina donges .
“ it ’ s something that the music industry has really woken up to . ”
but the channels of sale for ringtones aren ’ t dominated by the music companies .
it ’ s the it and mobile phone companies with their greater technological know-how who ’ ve cleverly stolen a march over the music industry .
t-mobile and vodafone are among the biggest ringtone providers , while bravo.de and jamba.de are leading the way in sales via web sites .
“ we sold 10 million ringtones last year , ” said jamba spokesman tilo bonow .
“ that was a 300 percent increase over the previous year . ”
in 2004 , jamba expects to make even more money . about a third of its € 2 asking price goes to the music industry , and another third to the mobile phone operators . ringtone to realtone t-mobile prefers to keep mum about its sales figures , saying only that it ’ s still in negotiations with music companies . the deutsche telekom division has signed a contract with universal mobile , a division of universal music international , which has signed artists such as the black eyed peas , shaggy , and u2 . through t-mobile , universal hopes to start selling so-called realtones to mobile phone users this year . unlike the monotone ringtones , realtones are the original song – exactly as it ’ s heard on the radio or on cd . they could be the development that sees ringtones break out of the teen market and bring the music industry the big-time profits it ’ s been hoping for . martin schrader -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry .

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .

chancellor schröder said germany would provide € 26 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- in aid to georgia to stabilize democracy and boost the economy during talks with young reformist president mikhail saakashvili in berlin . mikhail saakashvili , the western-educated reformist president of georgia and europe ’ s youngest state leader to be sworn in last sunday , secured promises of financial aid and technical know-how from the german government during his first official trip as president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- with georgian president mikhail saakashwili in berlin speaking after talks with saakashvili in berlin on friday , german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that the fresh funds amounting to € 26 million were aimed at bolstering the georgian economy and stabilizing democracy .
" every euro will go to the people " saakashvili , a former opposition leader who was elected president following the november ouster of president eduard shevarnadze , said his government , unlike its predecessor , would make sure foreign aid reached its target and wouldn ’ t be swallowed by corruption .
" georgia is a country that needs a lot of support from outside , " he said .
" i promise you every euro , every cent of this support will go to the people . "
saakashvili said georgia needed foreign help to repair its battered economy .
the world bank estimates that the economy shrank by two-thirds in the first decade after independence .
nearly half of its 4.5 million people live on less than $ 4.15 a day .
german know-how for georgia schröder also promised saakashvili his government would send experts to develop a customs system for the country and educate diplomats .
schröder described georgia as " a key country in a region that is far from conflict-free " and one that needed outside help to help stabilize it .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said georgia faced " a great challenge to improve the situation of its population . "
wieczorek-zeul said the german government was willing to support saakashvili ’ s plans to combat widespread corruption in his country .
experts from the german development ministry are already in the georgian capital of tbilisi to intensify cooperation .
the ministry has also provided georgia with € 12 million in emergency aid to help improve electricity supply during the winter months .
the " rose revolutionary " rides wave of optimism saakashvili also presented schröder with a golden rose on friday , symbol of the bloodless revolution after ousting former president shevarnadze from power last november .
shevarnadze , who had ruled georgia for 11 years , resigned at the end of november after three weeks of mass protest by a population weary of poverty and corruption .
saakashvili , the former justice minister , led the demonstrations and was dubbed the " rose revolutionary " after storming the parliament holding a rose .
" i 've received much praise from our people , without ever having campaigned , " said saakashvili .
" now i need to take this positive energy and shift it in the right direction . "
top of the list of necessary changes is the corruption-rife georgian political system .
saakashvilli , once groomed by shevarnadze for a top position , eventually quit his post as justice minister in 2002 after growing weary of pervasive cronyism and political pay-off .
in an interview with german daily bild , saakashvili said he planned to improve the taxation system and invest more in the country 's youth .

german defense minister peter struck has wrapped up a visit to the northern afghan city of kunduz , saying the country still is n't " stable " and has ruled out helping the afghans fight the drug trade . german defense minister peter struck met with around 200 german soldiers in the northern afghan city of kunduz on saturday , part of the bundeswehr ’ s provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- .
it marked the first time that the defense chief visited the recently deployed troops since the german bundestag agreed the controversial expansion of the bundeswehr ’ s international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mandate outside kabul in october .
the german prt , which first arrived in kunduz last october and are under a nato mandate , are meant to ensure a secure atmosphere for the afghan government as well as international civil reconstruction workers and aid workers in the province .

with thousands of u.s. and british troops still engaged in active service against remnants of taliban and al qaeda fighters across the country in operations under the " enduring freedom " banner , there is a fear that the germans in kunduz can not rely on afghans distinguishing between the war on terror and reconstruction .
prior to his visit , struck said in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag that he feared a resurgence of suicide attacks .
" the situation has become more unstable in afghanistan , " he said .

but in very rare cases , doctors have to help parents decide what gender their child will be .
if they are affected by cloacal exstrophy , children 's genitals - along with the rest of the pelvis including the bladder and the bowel - do not form normally .
it is an extremely serious condition and , in the past , babies affected by it died .
developments in medical technology now mean they can be saved .
but when children who are genetically male are affected by the condition , doctors have to decide if they can live as a male , or if surgery is needed to give them female genitals .
experts are divided over how this delicate decision should be approached .
' comfort ' us researchers claim many of those given a female gender at birth decide to live as males later in life . "
children generally are comfortable in their female identity " great ormond street hospital spokesman the team , from johns hopkins university in baltimore and the university of oklahoma assessed 14 genetic males aged five to 16 years old , who had been assigned socially , legally and surgically as female .
eight had declared themselves as male during the follow-up period , which lasted up to eight years .
dr william reiner , who led the study , said children had chosen the gender they felt most comfortable with .
" they said ' when mom and dad said i was a boy , it all made sense .
then i realised it was true .
then it just happened ' .
" children transition extraordinarily rapidly . "
dr reiner said the decision to remove a child 's testicles at birth and carry out surgery to give them female genitals was based on the belief that children are sexually and psychologically neutral at birth , what their genitals looked like and how they were brought up .
but he said : " those are enormous assumptions " , adding recent research suggested hormones released before birth had a major influence on a child 's sexuality .
difficult choice however , doctors at london 's great ormond street hospital who treat children with the condition , says the us research focuses on children referred for treatment because they have had problems , rather than looking at a cross-section of children with cloacal exstrophy .
dr polly carmichael , a psychologist who works with children affected by cloacal exstrophy , told bbc news online the decision was based on many factors , including what the child 's genitals look like .
she said : " the penis is often very small , and gender assignment has been based on the viability of that as a functioning organ . "
but she said psychologists and endocrinologists , as well as the child 's parents , would decide what was best for that child .
dr carmichael accepted it was a difficult decision to make for someone who was just a baby - but that failing to do so could lead to different problems for the child and their family .
" some people have argued that you should n't assign a sex at birth , and you should just wait and see .
" but how would a child feel later on in terms of making its way in the world ? "
only around half of genetic males with the condition treated at great ormond street are reared as girls .
in the past , virtually all would have been raised as females .
a spokesman for the hospital said : " we are in the last stages of a study looking at children treated for cloacal exstrophy here in the last 20 years .
" the evidence from our study is that the children generally are comfortable in their female identity . "
he added : " these are complex issues , and it has to be said that any child born with the condition could suffer psychological difficulty regardless of whether they are gender reassigned or not . "

but in very rare cases , doctors have to help parents decide what gender their child will be .
if they are affected by cloacal exstrophy , children 's genitals - along with the rest of the pelvis including the bladder and the bowel - do not form normally .
it is an extremely serious condition and , in the past , babies affected by it died .
developments in medical technology now mean they can be saved .
but when children who are genetically male are affected by the condition , doctors have to decide if they can live as a male , or if surgery is needed to give them female genitals .
experts are divided over how this delicate decision should be approached .
' comfort ' us researchers claim many of those given a female gender at birth decide to live as males later in life .
children generally are comfortable in their female identity great ormond street hospital spokesman the team , from johns hopkins university in baltimore and the university of oklahoma assessed 14 genetic males aged five to 16 years old , who had been assigned socially , legally and surgically as female .
eight had declared themselves as male during the follow-up period , which lasted up to eight years .
dr william reiner , who led the study , said children had chosen the gender they felt most comfortable with .
" they said ' when mom and dad said i was a boy , it all made sense .
then i realised it was true .
then it just happened ' .
" children transition extraordinarily rapidly . "
dr reiner said the decision to remove a child 's testicles at birth and carry out surgery to give them female genitals was based on the belief that children are sexually and psychologically neutral at birth , what their genitals looked like and how they were brought up .
but he said : " those are enormous assumptions " , adding recent research suggested hormones released before birth had a major influence on a child 's sexuality .
difficult choice however , doctors at london 's great ormond street hospital who treat children with the condition , says the us research focuses on children referred for treatment because they have had problems , rather than looking at a cross-section of children with cloacal exstrophy .
dr polly carmichael , a psychologist who works with children affected by cloacal exstrophy , told bbc news online the decision was based on many factors , including what the child 's genitals look like .
she said : " the penis is often very small , and gender assignment has been based on the viability of that as a functioning organ . "
but she said psychologists and endocrinologists , as well as the child 's parents , would decide what was best for that child .
dr carmichael accepted it was a difficult decision to make for someone who was just a baby - but that failing to do so could lead to different problems for the child and their family .
" some people have argued that you should n't assign a sex at birth , and you should just wait and see .
" but how would a child feel later on in terms of making its way in the world ? "
only around half of genetic males with the condition treated at great ormond street are reared as girls .
in the past , virtually all would have been raised as females .
a spokesman for the hospital said : " we are in the last stages of a study looking at children treated for cloacal exstrophy here in the last 20 years .
" the evidence from our study is that the children generally are comfortable in their female identity . "
he added : " these are complex issues , and it has to be said that any child born with the condition could suffer psychological difficulty regardless of whether they are gender reassigned or not . "

minutes before alastair campbell took to the stage on friday night for the first in a series of one-man shows , news broke that bbc journalist andrew gilligan had handed in his resignation .
as a scene-setter for a piece of political theatre this was surely hard to beat .
but it was clear from the outset that the former downing street spin doctor was not going to let his epic row with the bbc overshadow his stage debut .
gilligan 's name was strictly off-limits .
campbell : a feisty performance the event was billed as an " evening of reminiscences and stories from behind the scenes plus a chance to put your questions to one of british politics ' key players " .
and that was precisely what the audience got .
the venue - presumably chosen to be as far removed from the westminster bubble as possible and in the middle of new labour 's north east heartland - was the customs house , a small south shields arts centre .
the 420-seat auditorium is more used to playing host to the lower rungs of the show business ladder .
forthcoming attractions include an evening with barry norman and an appearance by the drifters , although , sadly for the journalists in the audience , not the spinners .
campbell gave a typically feisty and combative performance , although with a bit more charm and humour than we are used to seeing from his television appearances .
gripping a lectern at the side of the compact stage , he treated the audience - including local mp and schools minister david milliband and local celebrity brendan foster - to a canter through his early , boozy years , when he was , he admitted , " chippy , bolshie and a bit punchy " .

the audience included quite a few of fleet street 's current crop , although campbell joked he would only take questions from journalists who had paid for their tickets with their own money .
after a short interval the house lights were switched on and campbell sat centre stage , fielding questions .
the hacks who had spent the interval gleefully jotting down the titles of the songs playing over the tannoy - including things can only get better , and i 'm still standing - found campbell one step ahead of them .

bbc ' vital ' then the impossible happened .
the first question from the audience left him lost for words .
did he think his obsessive nature was due to the fact that he had been an alcoholic .
was he , in fact , a " dry drunk " ?
campbell took a drink of water .
" i do n't know .
i am not 100 % sure that i was an alcoholic , " he said .
booze had contributed to his nervous breakdown , he said , but unlike the questioner he had never enrolled with alcoholics anonymous .
after that it was plain sailing .
there were several attempts to pin him down on iraq , which were painstakingly rebutted .
he was also at pains to draw a line under his row with the bbc .
" i think the bbc is a vital part of this country .
i have never been anything other than a supporter of its independence and i do n't think i want to say anything else , " he said to loud applause .
a times journalist asked if he had any comment to make on andrew gilligan 's resignation .
" i do n't .
no . "
it was a load of spin ruth leonard , student he did n't pull any punches when it came to his role in the row over the government 's iraq weapons dossiers .
" please do n't sit there when i have just been cleared by lord hutton and call me a liar , " he told one questioner .
his true venom was reserved for the daily mail , as time and again he singled out the paper 's editorial stance for criticism .
in fact , his main theme - apart from emphasising his loyalty to the labour party and his ongoing friendship with tony blair - was the cynicism of the british press .
careful words there was , in truth , plenty of ammunition for the cynical british press to get their teeth into .
now that nelson mandela had retired , he said , tony blair was probably the most popular and respected politician in the world .
there was clearly a tension between campbell 's efforts to be candid with the audience and his desire to avoid handing the press a free headline .
he chose his words with great care throughout .
the biggest gaffe of the night - and the only time he threatened to go off message - was when he said george w bush was " a lot cleverer than he looks " .
he quickly back-pedalled , deftly turning it into a joke .
" i did n't say that last sentence .
that was unsaid . "
in the theatre 's bar afterwards , reaction was mixed .
" i think he came across as incredibly genuine and committed .
i was surprised about how positive he was about the bbc , " said andrew dixon , 45 , who works in the arts .
others were less convinced .
" i think it was just a performance .
it did n't change my opinion of him at all .
it was a load of spin , " said 17-year-old a-level student ruth leonard .

minutes before alastair campbell took to the stage on friday night for the first in a series of one-man shows , news broke that bbc journalist andrew gilligan had handed in his resignation .
as a scene-setter for a piece of political theatre this was surely hard to beat .
but it was clear from the outset that the former downing street spin doctor was not going to let his epic row with the bbc overshadow his stage debut .
gilligan 's name was strictly off-limits .
campbell : a feisty performance the event was billed as an " evening of reminiscences and stories from behind the scenes plus a chance to put your questions to one of british politics ' key players " .
and that was precisely what the audience got .
the venue - presumably chosen to be as far removed from the westminster bubble as possible and in the middle of new labour 's north east heartland - was the customs house , a small south shields arts centre .
the 420-seat auditorium is more used to playing host to the lower rungs of the show business ladder .
forthcoming attractions include an evening with barry norman and an appearance by the drifters , although , sadly for the journalists in the audience , not the spinners .
campbell gave a typically feisty and combative performance , although with a bit more charm and humour than we are used to seeing from his television appearances .
gripping a lectern at the side of the compact stage , he treated the audience - including local mp and schools minister david milliband and local celebrity brendan foster - to a canter through his early , boozy years , when he was , he admitted , " chippy , bolshie and a bit punchy " .
please do n't sit there when i have just been cleared by lord hutton and call me a liar alastair campbell he touched briefly on his spell as a writer of soft porn for forum magazine -lrb- begun for a bet with a friend over who could get into print first , apparently -rrb- , before moving on to his fleet street career .
the audience included quite a few of fleet street 's current crop , although campbell joked he would only take questions from journalists who had paid for their tickets with their own money .
after a short interval the house lights were switched on and campbell sat centre stage , fielding questions .
the hacks who had spent the interval gleefully jotting down the titles of the songs playing over the tannoy - including things can only get better , and i 'm still standing - found campbell one step ahead of them .
" i promise i had no hand in the choice of music , " he smiled .
bbc ' vital ' then the impossible happened .
the first question from the audience left him lost for words .
did he think his obsessive nature was due to the fact that he had been an alcoholic .
was he , in fact , a " dry drunk " ?
campbell took a drink of water .
" i do n't know .
i am not 100 % sure that i was an alcoholic , " he said .
booze had contributed to his nervous breakdown , he said , but unlike the questioner he had never enrolled with alcoholics anonymous .
after that it was plain sailing .
there were several attempts to pin him down on iraq , which were painstakingly rebutted .
he was also at pains to draw a line under his row with the bbc .
" i think the bbc is a vital part of this country .
i have never been anything other than a supporter of its independence and i do n't think i want to say anything else , " he said to loud applause .
a times journalist asked if he had any comment to make on andrew gilligan 's resignation .
" i do n't .
no . "
it was a load of spin ruth leonard , student he did n't pull any punches when it came to his role in the row over the government 's iraq weapons dossiers .
" please do n't sit there when i have just been cleared by lord hutton and call me a liar , " he told one questioner .
his true venom was reserved for the daily mail , as time and again he singled out the paper 's editorial stance for criticism .
in fact , his main theme - apart from emphasising his loyalty to the labour party and his ongoing friendship with tony blair - was the cynicism of the british press .
careful words there was , in truth , plenty of ammunition for the cynical british press to get their teeth into .
now that nelson mandela had retired , he said , tony blair was probably the most popular and respected politician in the world .
there was clearly a tension between campbell 's efforts to be candid with the audience and his desire to avoid handing the press a free headline .
he chose his words with great care throughout .
the biggest gaffe of the night - and the only time he threatened to go off message - was when he said george w bush was " a lot cleverer than he looks " .
he quickly back-pedalled , deftly turning it into a joke .
" i did n't say that last sentence .
that was unsaid . "
in the theatre 's bar afterwards , reaction was mixed .
" i think he came across as incredibly genuine and committed .
i was surprised about how positive he was about the bbc , " said andrew dixon , 45 , who works in the arts .
others were less convinced .
" i think it was just a performance .
it did n't change my opinion of him at all .
it was a load of spin , " said 17-year-old a-level student ruth leonard .

minutes before alastair campbell took to the stage on friday night for the first in a series of one-man shows , news broke that bbc journalist andrew gilligan had handed in his resignation .
as a scene-setter for a piece of political theatre this was surely hard to beat .
but it was clear from the outset that the former downing street spin doctor was not going to let his epic row with the bbc overshadow his stage debut .
gilligan 's name was strictly off-limits .
the event was billed as an " evening of reminiscences and stories from behind the scenes plus a chance to put your questions to one of british politics ' key players " .
and that was precisely what the audience got .
the venue - presumably chosen to be as far removed from the westminster bubble as possible and in the middle of new labour 's north east heartland - was the customs house , a small south shields arts centre .
the 420-seat auditorium is more used to playing host to the lower rungs of the show business ladder .
forthcoming attractions include an evening with barry norman and an appearance by the drifters , although , sadly for the journalists in the audience , not the spinners .
campbell gave a typically feisty and combative performance , although with a bit more charm and humour than we are used to seeing from his television appearances .
gripping a lectern at the side of the compact stage , he treated the audience - including local mp and schools minister david milliband and local celebrity brendan foster - to a canter through his early , boozy years , when he was , he admitted , " chippy , bolshie and a bit punchy " . "
please do n't sit there when i have just been cleared by lord hutton and call me a liar " alastair campbell he touched briefly on his spell as a writer of soft porn for forum magazine -lrb- begun for a bet with a friend over who could get into print first , apparently -rrb- , before moving on to his fleet street career .
the audience included quite a few of fleet street 's current crop , although campbell joked he would only take questions from journalists who had paid for their tickets with their own money .
after a short interval the house lights were switched on and campbell sat centre stage , fielding questions .
the hacks who had spent the interval gleefully jotting down the titles of the songs playing over the tannoy - including things can only get better , and i 'm still standing - found campbell one step ahead of them .
" i promise i had no hand in the choice of music , " he smiled .
bbc ' vital ' then the impossible happened .

" i 'd keep it in the refrigerator , " he laughs .
" to keep it preserved " .
he may be making space among the milk and cheese in his fridge pretty soon after finding nemo was nominated for four academy awards earlier this week .
pixar 's charming animated movie about a clown fish 's search for his missing son is up for best animated feature film among others .
just days after the announcement , mr walsh flew in from pixar 's studios in california to give a lecture about the making of the film at teesside university 's annual animation festival animex .
and , as he explained , they went to extraordinary depths to capture the magic of being underwater .
i would go and eat sushi , wondering what kind of fish i was eating and i 'd start to feel really guilty about it mark walsh from scuba diving off australia to calling in the expertise of a professor of ecology , mr walsh said finding nemo was a painstaking process .
" making fish believable is not just about waggling their tail back and forth , we wanted to be true to the swell and surge of the sea , " he said .
" we went to lots of aquariums , we even called in a fish expert who had spent his life studying the movement of fish on a kind of ' fish treadmill ' .
" i went -lsb- diving -rsb- off the coast of california to study the fish , but the guys who were designing the environment went to the great barrier reef to get a close look at the coral .
" just being there in the water you get a better feel for the environment and see the fish , not only how they move , but how they move with the currents , the murkiness of the water .
" the environment in nemo is as important to the experience as the story and the characters themselves . "
finding nemo grossed more than $ 500m at the box office and it is the storyline and loveable characters that makes finding nemo so special .
in the film , the main character nemo gets taken from his home in the great barrier reef and ends up in an office fish tank .
nemo 's father marlin and his amnesiac sidekick dory search the seas for the missing fish .
the animators were limited to conveying emotions through the fish 's facial expressions and the odd flick of a fin , a challenge that mr walsh said proved inspirational .
he added it was often the voiceover actors who provided the spark .
he said : " we always set up a video camera to record the actors and ellen -lsb- degeneres -rsb- , as dory , was just fantastic , she was so expressive and i used her a lot .
" she had all these mannerisms - which we called ' ellenisms ' - that i loved .
" i was so excited to meet her that when i eventually did i think i must have given her the willies i was staring so much . "
but mr walsh said much of his inspiration for characters comes from real life .
ellen degeneres provided the voice of dory " to be a great animator , you are not only an actor and an artist you have to be an observer of the world , " he said .
" i was at the airport just the other day and saw this guy whose body was shaped just like the letter ' s ' and i just thought ' wow , that 's great ' .
" when i got to my hotel room , i got my drawing pad out and sketched him .
who knows , he might pop up in a film someday . "
sitting in a stark , utilitarian boardroom at teesside university , mr walsh is a million miles from his polynesian paradise-themed office back at pixar , but his creativity and enthusiasm for his chosen career shines through .
disney deal he admits it can be difficult to leave work behind at the end of the day .
" i found myself thinking about fish a lot while on nemo , " he laughed .
" i would go and eat sushi , wondering what kind of fish i was eating and i 'd start to feel really guilty about it .
" i also had a fish tank and i 'd just sit and stare at it for hours trying to get ideas .
" it is hard to switch off when your hobby is also your work . "
mark also worked on monsters inc .
on friday pixar announced it was ending its distribution deal with walt disney after nine years and five movies that have generated $ 2.5bn at the box office .
pixar has said it will honour its commitment to two further films with disney which are already in production .
mr walsh said : " pixar has grown from the experience and it is all thanks to disney .
" the relationship has proved very successful but perhaps pixar now deserves greater independence . "
the final two films with disney are the incredibles , due out at the end of the year , and cars , scheduled for release in 2005 .
mr walsh said the incredibles - a tale about a lapsed superhero family living in the suburbs - lives up to its name .
" i have never seen the crew so excited and energised about a film .
it is looking - literally - incredible . "
students ' work mr walsh is in middlesbrough this week to speak at teesside university 's fifth annual animation festival alongside other big names from the world of animation such as oscar-winning ray harryhausen .
he added : " animex is fantastic , it is bringing animators from all over the globe together .
" i met the bloke who designed bob the builder yesterday and i was like ' wow ' - i love that programme .
" it is also fantastic to get the chance to see what the students here are doing . "
what about the prospects of that oscar ?
" nemo is definitely my favourite of the films i 've worked on , " he said .
" if it wins , i do n't know if we 'd get our own oscars , but i 'd definitely get to keep it for a couple of days which would be wonderful . "

" i 'd keep it in the refrigerator , " he laughs .
" to keep it preserved " .
he may be making space among the milk and cheese in his fridge pretty soon after finding nemo was nominated for four academy awards earlier this week .
pixar 's charming animated movie about a clown fish 's search for his missing son is up for best animated feature film among others .
just days after the announcement , mr walsh flew in from pixar 's studios in california to give a lecture about the making of the film at teesside university 's annual animation festival animex .
and , as he explained , they went to extraordinary depths to capture the magic of being underwater .
i would go and eat sushi , wondering what kind of fish i was eating and i 'd start to feel really guilty about it mark walsh from scuba diving off australia to calling in the expertise of a professor of ecology , mr walsh said finding nemo was a painstaking process .
" making fish believable is not just about waggling their tail back and forth , we wanted to be true to the swell and surge of the sea , " he said .
" we went to lots of aquariums , we even called in a fish expert who had spent his life studying the movement of fish on a kind of ' fish treadmill ' .
" i went -lsb- diving -rsb- off the coast of california to study the fish , but the guys who were designing the environment went to the great barrier reef to get a close look at the coral .
" just being there in the water you get a better feel for the environment and see the fish , not only how they move , but how they move with the currents , the murkiness of the water .
" the environment in nemo is as important to the experience as the story and the characters themselves . "
finding nemo grossed more than $ 500m at the box office and it is the storyline and loveable characters that makes finding nemo so special .
in the film , the main character nemo gets taken from his home in the great barrier reef and ends up in an office fish tank .
nemo 's father marlin and his amnesiac sidekick dory search the seas for the missing fish .
the animators were limited to conveying emotions through the fish 's facial expressions and the odd flick of a fin , a challenge that mr walsh said proved inspirational .
he added it was often the voiceover actors who provided the spark .
he said : " we always set up a video camera to record the actors and ellen -lsb- degeneres -rsb- , as dory , was just fantastic , she was so expressive and i used her a lot .
" she had all these mannerisms - which we called ' ellenisms ' - that i loved .
" i was so excited to meet her that when i eventually did i think i must have given her the willies i was staring so much . "
but mr walsh said much of his inspiration for characters comes from real life .
ellen degeneres provided the voice of dory " to be a great animator , you are not only an actor and an artist you have to be an observer of the world , " he said .
" i was at the airport just the other day and saw this guy whose body was shaped just like the letter ' s ' and i just thought ' wow , that 's great ' .
" when i got to my hotel room , i got my drawing pad out and sketched him .
who knows , he might pop up in a film someday . "
sitting in a stark , utilitarian boardroom at teesside university , mr walsh is a million miles from his polynesian paradise-themed office back at pixar , but his creativity and enthusiasm for his chosen career shines through .
disney deal he admits it can be difficult to leave work behind at the end of the day .
" i found myself thinking about fish a lot while on nemo , " he laughed .
" i would go and eat sushi , wondering what kind of fish i was eating and i 'd start to feel really guilty about it .
" i also had a fish tank and i 'd just sit and stare at it for hours trying to get ideas .
" it is hard to switch off when your hobby is also your work . "
mark also worked on monsters inc .
on friday pixar announced it was ending its distribution deal with walt disney after nine years and five movies that have generated $ 2.5bn at the box office .
pixar has said it will honour its commitment to two further films with disney which are already in production .
mr walsh said : " pixar has grown from the experience and it is all thanks to disney .
" the relationship has proved very successful but perhaps pixar now deserves greater independence . "
the final two films with disney are the incredibles , due out at the end of the year , and cars , scheduled for release in 2005 .
mr walsh said the incredibles - a tale about a lapsed superhero family living in the suburbs - lives up to its name .
" i have never seen the crew so excited and energised about a film .
it is looking - literally - incredible . "
students ' work mr walsh is in middlesbrough this week to speak at teesside university 's fifth annual animation festival alongside other big names from the world of animation such as oscar-winning ray harryhausen .
he added : " animex is fantastic , it is bringing animators from all over the globe together .
" i met the bloke who designed bob the builder yesterday and i was like ' wow ' - i love that programme .
" it is also fantastic to get the chance to see what the students here are doing . "
what about the prospects of that oscar ?
" nemo is definitely my favourite of the films i 've worked on , " he said .
" if it wins , i do n't know if we 'd get our own oscars , but i 'd definitely get to keep it for a couple of days which would be wonderful . "

disney deal he admits it can be difficult to leave work behind at the end of the day .

he may be making space among the milk and cheese in his fridge pretty soon after finding nemo was nominated for four academy awards earlier this week .
pixar 's charming animated movie about a clown fish 's search for his missing son is up for best animated feature film among others .

" making fish believable is not just about waggling their tail back and forth , we wanted to be true to the swell and surge of the sea , " he said .
" we went to lots of aquariums , we even called in a fish expert who had spent his life studying the movement of fish on a kind of ' fish treadmill ' .
" i went -lsb- diving -rsb- off the coast of california to study the fish , but the guys who were designing the environment went to the great barrier reef to get a close look at the coral .
" just being there in the water you get a better feel for the environment and see the fish , not only how they move , but how they move with the currents , the murkiness of the water .
" the environment in nemo is as important to the experience as the story and the characters themselves . "
finding nemo grossed more than $ 500m at the box office and it is the storyline and loveable characters that makes finding nemo so special .
in the film , the main character nemo gets taken from his home in the great barrier reef and ends up in an office fish tank .
nemo 's father marlin and his amnesiac sidekick dory search the seas for the missing fish .
the animators were limited to conveying emotions through the fish 's facial expressions and the odd flick of a fin , a challenge that mr walsh said proved inspirational .
he added it was often the voiceover actors who provided the spark .

" i was so excited to meet her that when i eventually did i think i must have given her the willies i was staring so much . "

" i 'd keep it in the refrigerator , " he laughs .
" to keep it preserved " .
he may be making space among the milk and cheese in his fridge pretty soon after finding nemo was nominated for four academy awards earlier this week .
pixar 's charming animated movie about a clown fish 's search for his missing son is up for best animated feature film among others .
just days after the announcement , mr walsh flew in from pixar 's studios in california to give a lecture about the making of the film at teesside university 's annual animation festival animex .
and , as he explained , they went to extraordinary depths to capture the magic of being underwater .
i would go and eat sushi , wondering what kind of fish i was eating and i 'd start to feel really guilty about it mark walsh from scuba diving off australia to calling in the expertise of a professor of ecology , mr walsh said finding nemo was a painstaking process .
" making fish believable is not just about waggling their tail back and forth , we wanted to be true to the swell and surge of the sea , " he said .
" we went to lots of aquariums , we even called in a fish expert who had spent his life studying the movement of fish on a kind of ' fish treadmill ' .
" i went -lsb- diving -rsb- off the coast of california to study the fish , but the guys who were designing the environment went to the great barrier reef to get a close look at the coral .
" just being there in the water you get a better feel for the environment and see the fish , not only how they move , but how they move with the currents , the murkiness of the water .
" the environment in nemo is as important to the experience as the story and the characters themselves . "
finding nemo grossed more than $ 500m at the box office and it is the storyline and loveable characters that makes finding nemo so special .
in the film , the main character nemo gets taken from his home in the great barrier reef and ends up in an office fish tank .
nemo 's father marlin and his amnesiac sidekick dory search the seas for the missing fish .
the animators were limited to conveying emotions through the fish 's facial expressions and the odd flick of a fin , a challenge that mr walsh said proved inspirational .
he added it was often the voiceover actors who provided the spark .
he said : " we always set up a video camera to record the actors and ellen -lsb- degeneres -rsb- , as dory , was just fantastic , she was so expressive and i used her a lot .
" she had all these mannerisms - which we called ' ellenisms ' - that i loved .
" i was so excited to meet her that when i eventually did i think i must have given her the willies i was staring so much . "
but mr walsh said much of his inspiration for characters comes from real life .
ellen degeneres provided the voice of dory " to be a great animator , you are not only an actor and an artist you have to be an observer of the world , " he said .
" i was at the airport just the other day and saw this guy whose body was shaped just like the letter ' s ' and i just thought ' wow , that 's great ' .
" when i got to my hotel room , i got my drawing pad out and sketched him .
who knows , he might pop up in a film someday . "
sitting in a stark , utilitarian boardroom at teesside university , mr walsh is a million miles from his polynesian paradise-themed office back at pixar , but his creativity and enthusiasm for his chosen career shines through .
disney deal he admits it can be difficult to leave work behind at the end of the day .
" i found myself thinking about fish a lot while on nemo , " he laughed .
" i would go and eat sushi , wondering what kind of fish i was eating and i 'd start to feel really guilty about it .
" i also had a fish tank and i 'd just sit and stare at it for hours trying to get ideas .
" it is hard to switch off when your hobby is also your work . "
mark also worked on monsters inc .
on friday pixar announced it was ending its distribution deal with walt disney after nine years and five movies that have generated $ 2.5bn at the box office .
pixar has said it will honour its commitment to two further films with disney which are already in production .
mr walsh said : " pixar has grown from the experience and it is all thanks to disney .
" the relationship has proved very successful but perhaps pixar now deserves greater independence . "
the final two films with disney are the incredibles , due out at the end of the year , and cars , scheduled for release in 2005 .
mr walsh said the incredibles - a tale about a lapsed superhero family living in the suburbs - lives up to its name .
" i have never seen the crew so excited and energised about a film .
it is looking - literally - incredible . "
students ' work mr walsh is in middlesbrough this week to speak at teesside university 's fifth annual animation festival alongside other big names from the world of animation such as oscar-winning ray harryhausen .
he added : " animex is fantastic , it is bringing animators from all over the globe together .
" i met the bloke who designed bob the builder yesterday and i was like ' wow ' - i love that programme .
" it is also fantastic to get the chance to see what the students here are doing . "
what about the prospects of that oscar ?
" nemo is definitely my favourite of the films i 've worked on , " he said .
" if it wins , i do n't know if we 'd get our own oscars , but i 'd definitely get to keep it for a couple of days which would be wonderful . "

technical aids amplified phones , textphones , and videophones alarm clocks that flash or shake under the pillow doorbells and phones that flash to alert you special smoke alarms and vibrating pagers to tell you what is happening in the home " having grown up deaf myself , i know only too well how important it is to receive the right information and equipment , which can both educate and liberate .
" the listening bus brings the latest information and equipment directly to parents and children , giving them the opportunity to experience new and different kinds of technology practically on their own doorsteps .
" without the bus families might otherwise not find out about the services or equipment available to them which could make a real , significant difference to their lives . "
the bus has travelled more than 100,000 miles to the furthest stretches of the uk and over 39,800 visitors have benefited from its services .
it is estimated about 840 children are born in the uk every year with a significant hearing loss .
every year , a further million children up to 8-years-old experience temporary deafness and discomfort caused by " glue ear " .
the listening bus makes a stop at nicva , 61 duncairn gardens , from 1030-1230 gmt .
