germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .
how sad " - rajeev no , eight years is definitely not enough for such a horrible crime !
since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .
the life sentence would not have been a punishment but a deterrent .
it would have deterred him from committing the same act on someone else . it appears the cannibal from rotenburg has been put on a diet for eight years - lorren britton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison -lrb- jan .

air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks . british airways and air france have scrapped five u.s.-bound flights on sunday and monday amid fears of airborne terrorist attacks .
the move came after u.s. officials cited new intelligence that osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network may be targeting five or six u.s.-bound flights from europe .
u.s. security officials said they alerted the countries and airlines involved and it was up to them whether to cancel the flights or step up security .
british airways said it had cancelled flight ba223 to washington on sunday and monday , and the return ba222 flights to london on the same days .
sunday 's ba207 london to miami flight was also cancelled .
sunday 's ba207 london to miami flight was also cancelled .
" we cancelled these flights on advice from the uk government for security reasons , " a spokeswoman for the airline told reuters .
air france scrapped two paris-washington flights .
" we confirm that for reasons of safety we have cancelled flight number 026 to washington on february 1 and the same flight on february 2 , " an air france spokeswoman said .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin told france 's tf1 tv station : " we have been for several months in an extremely tense international environment ... air france has thus decided to take necessary measures and suspend the flights , i think it 's a wise decision . "
on sunday , american airline , continental became the latest to cancel flights .
it scrapped sunday 's flight from glasgow in scotland to newark .
u.s. officials fear resurgent al qaeda attacks though the exact nature of the latest u.s. intelligence remains unclear , a spokesman for the u.s. department of homeland security told the bbc , " we remain concerned about al qaeda ’ s desire to target international aviation . "
he added : " there was specific credible threat information that was shared with some foreign governments , including the british and french governments , and the decisions were made to cancel these flights . "
u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .
al qaeda has been blamed for carrying out the sep.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , involving four hijacked commercial airplanes in new york and washington , which killed more than 3,000 people .
debate over use of sky marshals the latest disruption in transatlantic air traffic , which has caused major inconvenience to hundreds of irate passengers , is expected to once again stir the debate over the use of armed guards on flights , a key demand by the u.s. in enhancing air security .
the issue arose after washington raised its terror-alert in december to the second-highest level and asked british airways and air france to cancel several u.s.-bound flights and put armed marshals on flights .
however several european countries including sweden , denmark and portugal have opposed the new regulations .
france and britain have indicated they might comply in case of a heightened security threat .
" new threats like those that we experienced at the end of last year , we take these threats seriously and you need within the framework of terrorism prevention to be meticulous , very vigilant in liaison with airlines , that is air france and british airways , " french foreign minister villepin said . from news wires -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu split over sky marshals a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .
how sad " - rajeev no , eight years is definitely not enough for such a horrible crime !
since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .

u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .

air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks . british airways and air france have scrapped five u.s.-bound flights on sunday and monday amid fears of airborne terrorist attacks .
the move came after u.s. officials cited new intelligence that osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network may be targeting five or six u.s.-bound flights from europe .
u.s. security officials said they alerted the countries and airlines involved and it was up to them whether to cancel the flights or step up security .
british airways said it had cancelled flight ba223 to washington on sunday and monday , and the return ba222 flights to london on the same days .

he added : " there was specific credible threat information that was shared with some foreign governments , including the british and french governments , and the decisions were made to cancel these flights . "
u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .
al qaeda has been blamed for carrying out the sep.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , involving four hijacked commercial airplanes in new york and washington , which killed more than 3,000 people .

u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .
al qaeda has been blamed for carrying out the sep.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , involving four hijacked commercial airplanes in new york and washington , which killed more than 3,000 people .
debate over use of sky marshals the latest disruption in transatlantic air traffic , which has caused major inconvenience to hundreds of irate passengers , is expected to once again stir the debate over the use of armed guards on flights , a key demand by the u.s. in enhancing air security .
the issue arose after washington raised its terror-alert in december to the second-highest level and asked british airways and air france to cancel several u.s.-bound flights and put armed marshals on flights .
however several european countries including sweden , denmark and portugal have opposed the new regulations .
france and britain have indicated they might comply in case of a heightened security threat .
" new threats like those that we experienced at the end of last year , we take these threats seriously and you need within the framework of terrorism prevention to be meticulous , very vigilant in liaison with airlines , that is air france and british airways , " french foreign minister villepin said . from news wires -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu split over sky marshals a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .

i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .
how sad " - rajeev no , eight years is definitely not enough for such a horrible crime !
since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .
the life sentence would not have been a punishment but a deterrent .
it would have deterred him from committing the same act on someone else . it appears the cannibal from rotenburg has been put on a diet for eight years - lorren britton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison -lrb- jan .

u.s. security officials said they alerted the countries and airlines involved and it was up to them whether to cancel the flights or step up security .

he added : " there was specific credible threat information that was shared with some foreign governments , including the british and french governments , and the decisions were made to cancel these flights . "
u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .
how sad " - rajeev no , eight years is definitely not enough for such a horrible crime !
since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .
the life sentence would not have been a punishment but a deterrent .
it would have deterred him from committing the same act on someone else . it appears the cannibal from rotenburg has been put on a diet for eight years - lorren britton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison -lrb- jan .

german legislators are planning to implement a new paragraph in the penal code called " protection of the intimate sphere " .
it foresees the penalization of any person who " takes unpermitted images of people in an apartment or a room well-concealed from the public and thus hurts their highly personal life . "
the proposed legislation has been lent a new urgency in the light of an increasing number of internet sites , featuring ordinary citizens , who are secretly photographed nude or semi-naked in toilets , changing rooms or their own gardens .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .

since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .

air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks . british airways and air france have scrapped five u.s.-bound flights on sunday and monday amid fears of airborne terrorist attacks .
the move came after u.s. officials cited new intelligence that osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network may be targeting five or six u.s.-bound flights from europe .
u.s. security officials said they alerted the countries and airlines involved and it was up to them whether to cancel the flights or step up security .
british airways said it had cancelled flight ba223 to washington on sunday and monday , and the return ba222 flights to london on the same days .

he added : " there was specific credible threat information that was shared with some foreign governments , including the british and french governments , and the decisions were made to cancel these flights . "
u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .
al qaeda has been blamed for carrying out the sep.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , involving four hijacked commercial airplanes in new york and washington , which killed more than 3,000 people .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .
how sad " - rajeev no , eight years is definitely not enough for such a horrible crime !
since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .
the life sentence would not have been a punishment but a deterrent .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .
wake up , deutchland ; all of us have weak moments - but how can a society condone fulfilling of those psychological lows .
they need to be supported by people and society to come out of it , rather than to finish them .
how sad " - rajeev no , eight years is definitely not enough for such a horrible crime !
since he did plan to eat his victim , it was a murder case , not just a case of man-slaughter .
i think he is too dangerous to be allowed to survive such an unacceptable crime - marina poon , england no , eight years is not enough .
there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .
the crime he committed reflects a person who is mentally sick .
he deserves at least a life sentence .
the life sentence would not have been a punishment but a deterrent .
it would have deterred him from committing the same act on someone else . it appears the cannibal from rotenburg has been put on a diet for eight years - lorren britton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison -lrb- jan .

the move came after u.s. officials cited new intelligence that osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network may be targeting five or six u.s.-bound flights from europe .
u.s. security officials said they alerted the countries and airlines involved and it was up to them whether to cancel the flights or step up security .

however several european countries including sweden , denmark and portugal have opposed the new regulations .
france and britain have indicated they might comply in case of a heightened security threat .

air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks . british airways and air france have scrapped five u.s.-bound flights on sunday and monday amid fears of airborne terrorist attacks .
the move came after u.s. officials cited new intelligence that osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network may be targeting five or six u.s.-bound flights from europe .
u.s. security officials said they alerted the countries and airlines involved and it was up to them whether to cancel the flights or step up security .
british airways said it had cancelled flight ba223 to washington on sunday and monday , and the return ba222 flights to london on the same days .
sunday 's ba207 london to miami flight was also cancelled .
sunday 's ba207 london to miami flight was also cancelled .
" we cancelled these flights on advice from the uk government for security reasons , " a spokeswoman for the airline told reuters .
air france scrapped two paris-washington flights .
" we confirm that for reasons of safety we have cancelled flight number 026 to washington on february 1 and the same flight on february 2 , " an air france spokeswoman said .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin told france 's tf1 tv station : " we have been for several months in an extremely tense international environment ... air france has thus decided to take necessary measures and suspend the flights , i think it 's a wise decision . "
on sunday , american airline , continental became the latest to cancel flights .
it scrapped sunday 's flight from glasgow in scotland to newark .
u.s. officials fear resurgent al qaeda attacks though the exact nature of the latest u.s. intelligence remains unclear , a spokesman for the u.s. department of homeland security told the bbc , " we remain concerned about al qaeda ’ s desire to target international aviation . "
he added : " there was specific credible threat information that was shared with some foreign governments , including the british and french governments , and the decisions were made to cancel these flights . "
u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge has said the u.s. government consistently receives intelligence that al qaeda is still interested in using aircraft , particularly commercial airplanes , to carry out an attack .
al qaeda has been blamed for carrying out the sep.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , involving four hijacked commercial airplanes in new york and washington , which killed more than 3,000 people .
debate over use of sky marshals the latest disruption in transatlantic air traffic , which has caused major inconvenience to hundreds of irate passengers , is expected to once again stir the debate over the use of armed guards on flights , a key demand by the u.s. in enhancing air security .
the issue arose after washington raised its terror-alert in december to the second-highest level and asked british airways and air france to cancel several u.s.-bound flights and put armed marshals on flights .
however several european countries including sweden , denmark and portugal have opposed the new regulations .
france and britain have indicated they might comply in case of a heightened security threat .
" new threats like those that we experienced at the end of last year , we take these threats seriously and you need within the framework of terrorism prevention to be meticulous , very vigilant in liaison with airlines , that is air france and british airways , " french foreign minister villepin said . from news wires -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu split over sky marshals a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row .

most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .

al qaeda has been blamed for carrying out the sep.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , involving four hijacked commercial airplanes in new york and washington , which killed more than 3,000 people .
debate over use of sky marshals the latest disruption in transatlantic air traffic , which has caused major inconvenience to hundreds of irate passengers , is expected to once again stir the debate over the use of armed guards on flights , a key demand by the u.s. in enhancing air security .
the issue arose after washington raised its terror-alert in december to the second-highest level and asked british airways and air france to cancel several u.s.-bound flights and put armed marshals on flights .
however several european countries including sweden , denmark and portugal have opposed the new regulations .
france and britain have indicated they might comply in case of a heightened security threat .
" new threats like those that we experienced at the end of last year , we take these threats seriously and you need within the framework of terrorism prevention to be meticulous , very vigilant in liaison with airlines , that is air france and british airways , " french foreign minister villepin said . from news wires -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu split over sky marshals a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row .

germany 's self-confessed cannibal was convicted to eight years and six months in prison .
is that punishment enough for the crime ?
dw-world readers give their opinion . " i can fully appreciate the difficult in rendering a decision on this case .
it appears both the convicted and the victim were mentally unstable , making this case even more difficult .
however , based on the fact mr. armin meiwes was fit to stand trial , i believe the sentence was not harsh enough .
he took advantage of another man 's mental instability to commit an unacceptable crime and thus should be harshly treated .
i do not know about your legal system in germany , but i would hope meiwes would not be given any further lenience through early release . " - rod huggins " this sentence is way too mild ! " - andre baumann , dublin , ireland " the fact that meiwes , a sexual deviate , will only be 50 when he is returned to society would tell most people that the recently returned sentence is not nearly long enough , despite his promise to " go straight " now that he has accomplished his fantasy .
anyone who is familiar with sex crimes knows once will never be enough for them .
most interestingly , however , is that your country has decriminalized murder when consent is given , also known as mercy killing or euthanasia , and this is the reason this monster could not be charged with murder , as he most assuredly should have been .
i can not imagine why the consent of the victim has anything whatever to do with the actions and intent of the perpetrator .
the spectacular failure of your legal system in this case is a letter perfect example to every other nation who is considering the decriminalization of killing by consent of precisely why this should never come to pass anywhere else in the world . " - kathie godfrey " this is another dehumanising experience from germany . what a shame the legal system lets him off with 8.5years in prison .
luckily , germany now has a confirmed human butcher in meiwes to help him complete his wish - a desired euthansia - literary excuse to help in murder ?
secondly , if bernd really came to be killed , why was he carrying a return ticket home ? such gruesome acts considered in legal parlance as manslaugther - when it is clearly the worst human murder.my love for germany has gone many notches down since this awful story appeared and with such a light sentence and a loss of mammoth dismay , is unbelievable .

there is there something wrong when a society fails to punish people such as the " cannibal from rotenburg " in an appropriate manner .

here is the letter , written on 21 march 2003 dear tony thank you for your letter of 19 march .
i note that a similar letter was sent to gavyn davies , the chairman of the bbc , and a longer version was sent to our director of news , richard sambrook .
they will also be replying .
firstly , and i do not mean to be rude , but having faced the biggest ever public demonstration in this country and the biggest ever backbench rebellion against a sitting government by its own supporters , would you not agree that your communications advisers are not best placed to advise whether or not the bbc has got its balance right between support and dissent ?
given these circumstances they are hardly in a position to make a reasoned judgement about the bbc 's impartiality .
you have been engaged in a difficult battle fighting for your particular view of the world to be accepted and quite understandably , you want that to be reported .
we , however have a different role in society .
our role in these circumstances is to try to give a balanced picture .
it is perfectly legitimate for you or your advisers to complain about particular stories - journalism is an imperfect profession - and if we make mistakes , as we inevitably do , under my leadership we will always say we were wrong and apologise .
however , for you to question the whole of the bbc 's output across a wide range of radio , television and online services because you are concerned about particular stories which do n't favour your view is unfair .
i believe we have made major efforts to ensure that the issues and events surrounding iraq have been properly reported .
let me explain how we have done that .
some weeks ago i set up a committee which ... decided to prevent any senior editorial figures at the bbc from going on the anti-war march ; it was that committee which insisted that we had to find a balanced audience for programmes like question time at a time when it was very hard to find supporters of the war willing to come on .
and it was that same committee when faced with a massive bias against the war among phone-in callers , decided to increase the number of phone lines so that pro-war listeners had a better chance of getting through and getting onto the programmes .
all this was done in an attempt to ensure our coverage was balanced .
that same committee has discussed on a number of occasions whether our reports from baghdad needed to be qualified .
until yesterday we have been of the opinion that our journalism has not been restricted in a way which required qualification as a matter of course and even yesterday , after the war started , our reporters did not have iraqi " minders " and were free to move around the city .
at no point has their copy been checked before broadcast .
my point is that we have discussed these sorts of issues at length and made the best judgements we could .
that our conclusions did n't always please alastair is unfortunate but not our primary concern ...
i can only assure you that under my leadership i will do everything in my power to defend the bbc 's fairness , independence and impartiality .
my committee is now meeting on a daily basis and we discuss the reporting of the iraq issue every morning ...
i appreciate the fact that your letter was private .
i , too , have no intention of making this reply public .

here is the letter , written on 21 march 2003 dear tony thank you for your letter of 19 march .
i note that a similar letter was sent to gavyn davies , the chairman of the bbc , and a longer version was sent to our director of news , richard sambrook .
they will also be replying .
firstly , and i do not mean to be rude , but having faced the biggest ever public demonstration in this country and the biggest ever backbench rebellion against a sitting government by its own supporters , would you not agree that your communications advisers are not best placed to advise whether or not the bbc has got its balance right between support and dissent ?
given these circumstances they are hardly in a position to make a reasoned judgement about the bbc 's impartiality .
you have been engaged in a difficult battle fighting for your particular view of the world to be accepted and quite understandably , you want that to be reported .
we , however have a different role in society .
our role in these circumstances is to try to give a balanced picture .
it is perfectly legitimate for you or your advisers to complain about particular stories - journalism is an imperfect profession - and if we make mistakes , as we inevitably do , under my leadership we will always say we were wrong and apologise .
however , for you to question the whole of the bbc 's output across a wide range of radio , television and online services because you are concerned about particular stories which do n't favour your view is unfair .
i believe we have made major efforts to ensure that the issues and events surrounding iraq have been properly reported .
let me explain how we have done that .
some weeks ago i set up a committee which ... decided to prevent any senior editorial figures at the bbc from going on the anti-war march ; it was that committee which insisted that we had to find a balanced audience for programmes like question time at a time when it was very hard to find supporters of the war willing to come on .
and it was that same committee when faced with a massive bias against the war among phone-in callers , decided to increase the number of phone lines so that pro-war listeners had a better chance of getting through and getting onto the programmes .
all this was done in an attempt to ensure our coverage was balanced .
that same committee has discussed on a number of occasions whether our reports from baghdad needed to be qualified .
until yesterday we have been of the opinion that our journalism has not been restricted in a way which required qualification as a matter of course and even yesterday , after the war started , our reporters did not have iraqi " minders " and were free to move around the city .
at no point has their copy been checked before broadcast .
my point is that we have discussed these sorts of issues at length and made the best judgements we could .
that our conclusions did n't always please alastair is unfortunate but not our primary concern ...
i can only assure you that under my leadership i will do everything in my power to defend the bbc 's fairness , independence and impartiality .
my committee is now meeting on a daily basis and we discuss the reporting of the iraq issue every morning ...
i appreciate the fact that your letter was private .
i , too , have no intention of making this reply public .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- brazil falls in love with linux home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : sunday , 1 february , 2004 , 09:44 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version brazil falls in love with linux by mark ashurst bbc world service business reporter in brazil one third of latin america 's computers may run linux behind locked doors at sao paulo university , professor arnando mandel has what you might call an ' intimate ' relationship with the science faculty computers .
two of the university 's computer servers have been named kama and sutra , after the ancient indian love-making manual , he explains .
computer servers are rarely objects of desire , but there is something special about professor mandel 's machines .
they run linux , an alternative to microsoft 's globally dominant windows operating system .
linux is known as ' open source ' software , because the computer code on which it 's based is available , free , for any programmer to customise and adapt .
professor mandel spells out what he sees as its main advantage over microsoft 's windows .
" the main thing is to be in control of your own data , " he says .
" in a democracy it 's important that a free government should n't be subject to the whims of a company . "
the entire " open source movement " - people who believe source codes for computer software should n't be hidden under patents and copyrights for commercial exploitation - is winning friends in the developing world .
free software is popular in china , india , even parts of africa .
nobody can say for sure , but in latin america , some estimates suggest open source systems will soon be installed on up to a third of all computers .
brazil is leading the trend , a battleground in a bigger contest - it 's little short of a war - between microsoft and linux .
business switch roberto ticoulat , a sao paulo-based coffee exporter , illustrates why linux is proving a hit with brazil 's businessmen as well as its academics .
children in the favelas are learning linux basics he is battling a full-blown computer crisis , with several of his machines spontaneously shutting down due to an unidentified malfunction .
mr ticoulat believes that his windows-based system may have been attacked by hackers , or have become infected with a virus .
his strategy for getting his system up and running again may help loosen microsoft 's grip on the global software market .
" i took one of my computers that had a problem last week and i implemented the two systems - linux and windows .
i wanted to see if windows goes down , and linux remains , " he says .
" if this happens , i 'm going to change to linux the next day for sure .
i 'm going to have to convert all my files , but at least i 'll be back at work .
nor is mr ticoulat alone .
he says regular full page newspaper adverts taken out by microsoft urging windows users to upgrade their systems illustrates just how widespread computer glitches are in brazil .
the xenophobic mentality in brazil actually is what drives people towards open source software in some cases paolo zappi , zappitec this , together with the cost of maintaining windows systems , is a powerful incentive for businesses to explore alternatives .
" every time you have an upgrade , you have to pay something .
that 's how microsoft makes money . " he says .
far from home linux was developed in finland thirteen years ago by its namesake , linus torvalds .
but it is in brazil that the system has found its most enthusiastic support .
the government 's top technology official wants to create what he calls a " continent of open source . "
even sao paulo 's mayor , a former tv sex therapist , champions a project to teach the basics of linux to children in the favelas - the slums of the world 's biggest city .
however , it may be linux 's cheerleaders may have overstated their case .
for one thing , while linux users do not have to pay licensing fees , installing and running the system is not completely " free " .
windows : facing stiff resistance add up the costs of training , technical support , customising new or specialised software ... and linux 's alleged cost advantage looks less convincing .
" it might be a little bit cheaper to install linux if you look at the whole system cost , although you are better protected from viruses " says paolo zappi of zappitec , a firm which installs linux systems for small businesses .
mr zappi suggests that popular resentment of microsoft is partly political .
" -lrb- microsoft -rrb- are the big monopoly and they come from america , " he says .
" the xenophobic mentality in brazil actually is what drives people towards open source software in some cases . "
bottom up at the same time , there is a lively debate in computing circles over whether linux is genuinely more secure .
" fans of linux and the open source movement will say that by being publicly available , there are far more people who can work on it , more people who can detect problems , and provide fixes for them more quickly , " says bryan glick , of london-based trade newspaper computing .

two of the university 's computer servers have been named kama and sutra , after the ancient indian love-making manual , he explains .
computer servers are rarely objects of desire , but there is something special about professor mandel 's machines .
they run linux , an alternative to microsoft 's globally dominant windows operating system .
linux is known as ' open source ' software , because the computer code on which it 's based is available , free , for any programmer to customise and adapt .
professor mandel spells out what he sees as its main advantage over microsoft 's windows .
" the main thing is to be in control of your own data , " he says .
" in a democracy it 's important that a free government should n't be subject to the whims of a company . "
the entire " open source movement " - people who believe source codes for computer software should n't be hidden under patents and copyrights for commercial exploitation - is winning friends in the developing world .
free software is popular in china , india , even parts of africa .
nobody can say for sure , but in latin america , some estimates suggest open source systems will soon be installed on up to a third of all computers .
brazil is leading the trend , a battleground in a bigger contest - it 's little short of a war - between microsoft and linux .
business switch roberto ticoulat , a sao paulo-based coffee exporter , illustrates why linux is proving a hit with brazil 's businessmen as well as its academics .
children in the favelas are learning linux basics he is battling a full-blown computer crisis , with several of his machines spontaneously shutting down due to an unidentified malfunction .
mr ticoulat believes that his windows-based system may have been attacked by hackers , or have become infected with a virus .
his strategy for getting his system up and running again may help loosen microsoft 's grip on the global software market .
" i took one of my computers that had a problem last week and i implemented the two systems - linux and windows .
i wanted to see if windows goes down , and linux remains , " he says .
" if this happens , i 'm going to change to linux the next day for sure .
i 'm going to have to convert all my files , but at least i 'll be back at work .
nor is mr ticoulat alone .
he says regular full page newspaper adverts taken out by microsoft urging windows users to upgrade their systems illustrates just how widespread computer glitches are in brazil .
the xenophobic mentality in brazil actually is what drives people towards open source software in some cases paolo zappi , zappitec this , together with the cost of maintaining windows systems , is a powerful incentive for businesses to explore alternatives .
" every time you have an upgrade , you have to pay something .
that 's how microsoft makes money . " he says .
far from home linux was developed in finland thirteen years ago by its namesake , linus torvalds .
but it is in brazil that the system has found its most enthusiastic support .
the government 's top technology official wants to create what he calls a " continent of open source . "
even sao paulo 's mayor , a former tv sex therapist , champions a project to teach the basics of linux to children in the favelas - the slums of the world 's biggest city .
however , it may be linux 's cheerleaders may have overstated their case .
for one thing , while linux users do not have to pay licensing fees , installing and running the system is not completely " free " .
windows : facing stiff resistance add up the costs of training , technical support , customising new or specialised software ... and linux 's alleged cost advantage looks less convincing .
" it might be a little bit cheaper to install linux if you look at the whole system cost , although you are better protected from viruses " says paolo zappi of zappitec , a firm which installs linux systems for small businesses .
mr zappi suggests that popular resentment of microsoft is partly political .
" -lrb- microsoft -rrb- are the big monopoly and they come from america , " he says .
" the xenophobic mentality in brazil actually is what drives people towards open source software in some cases . "
bottom up at the same time , there is a lively debate in computing circles over whether linux is genuinely more secure .
" fans of linux and the open source movement will say that by being publicly available , there are far more people who can work on it , more people who can detect problems , and provide fixes for them more quickly , " says bryan glick , of london-based trade newspaper computing .
" on the other side , microsoft will say there 's no way you can manage something like that using software programmers all around the world , you need to have it within a company that has all its expertise within its own doors . "

fifty-four percent of people said tony blair 's reputation had deteriorated even though he was vindicated in the report , an icm poll shows .
only 14 % thought his status had improved after lord hutton cleared him of any wrongdoing .
the hutton report the poll for the news of the world revealed 30 % of people thought the prime minister 's position had been seriously damaged , with a further 24 % said it had suffered slightly .
however , the bbc also lost public confidence , according to the survey of 533 adults on 29 and 30 january .
it found 56 % of people now believed they should not have to pay a licence fee .
the report sparked three bbc resignations - the director general greg dyke , the chairman gavyn davies and reporter andrew gilligan .

yougov , in the daily telegraph on friday , found that 56 % thought hutton was a member of the establishment and this produced a whitewash .
fifty-two percent said mr blair had acted improperly in the kelly affair .
icm , for the guardian also on friday , found that 60 % believed the government had treated kelly unfairly .
less respect a yougov poll for sunday 's jonathan dimbleby programme on itv , maintained the pattern , showing people do not believe hutton 's conclusions .
on the question of whether the government sexed up the intelligence case for going to war , 54 % believed that the government was guilty , against 27 % who did not .
over half of respondents said there should be a judicial inquiry on why the government took britain to war , compared to 32 % who did not .
only 26 % said they trusted the government , while 65 % did not , but of those who have changed their mind in the past few days 4 % have more respect , while 19 % have less for the government .

but now , the program is going mainstream , reports technology correspondent clark boyd .
major global computer companies are now embracing linux .
ibm , for one , is currently running a series of television and online ads proclaiming that the future is open , as in open source computing .
they have even enlisted author kurt vonnegut to help promote the open source ideal of sharing your computer code with others .
it is a far cry from the days when the only people who knew about linux were a small community of zealous enthusiasts .
the interest from big companies is helping linux programmers get the recognition they deserve .
" it 's helping us get more appreciation from the rest of the world , " said open source guru bruce perens .
" we are no longer isolated geeks making a system only we know is good .
and i think there 's a lot of benefit . "
modify and share the linux operating system was created more than a decade ago by linus torvalds , then just a student at the university of helsinki in finland .
since then , the program has been further refined by programmers worldwide .
the code of linux is open source , meaning anyone can look at it and modify it , as long as they agree to share their changes with everyone else .
large companies have been benefiting from linux for years now .
they use it to run large servers and networks .
the number one issue for many of these companies is money .
linux can be a low-cost alternative to other , proprietary operating systems like microsoft windows .
because linux is open source , it can be obtained for free , although most companies pay software developers for a package of linux-based applications , including e-mail and word processing .
they also pay for customer support .
but usually not near as much as they would pay to a proprietary vendor .
that is encouraging software developers around the world to make linux-based products .
" i think the market is looking for an alternative to microsoft , " said dan wensley , from net integration technologies in ontario , canada .
" just being an alternative to microsoft in a lot of markets globally will give you an opportunity .
" today , business has adopted linux as an alternative , and as a viable , sometimes better , sometimes as-good-as solution and we 've seen it over last five to six years , develop into a real market and real opportunity and real saleable item , " he said .
saving money linux is also proving popular in the public sector .
governments like the idea of not paying a proprietary vendor huge licensing fees for years and years . "
if you spend a dollar with a local company working on linux , that dollar stays in your economy " simon phipps , sun microsystems they also like the fact that open source software allows them to modify the code themselves .
" what we see happening in europe is that governments are picking it up , " said marcel hartog of computer associates .
" if you talk to governments , they 're actually thinking - why do n't we write open source software as well .
" so it 's not just cost-based , but also the concept of open source software .
they just like the idea of saving the people money , but also giving back to the people what they created . "
the german city of munich , for one , recently decided to move from windows to linux .
israel and brazil have also begun initiatives to increase their use of open-source solutions .
microsoft rival , sun microsystems , is currently working with the chinese government on open-source software development .
china wants to use linux to create its own , home-grown software industry .
" if you spend a dollar with a local company working on linux , that dollar stays in your economy , " said simon phipps of sun microsystems .
" when you spend a dollar with a multi-national corporation as a license fee for a piece of software , that dollar leaves your country . "
" it 's about keeping the money in your local economy , developing skills and developing the local economy to be strong in its own right in a global context . "
and that is why some think open-source could be the way of the future , especially for developing countries .
dimo calovksi , who works on development issues at the united nations , believes open source could tap into the developing world 's natural strengths .
" in order to be a good information technology professional , to be a developer , programmer , system administrator , one has to have a problem-solving mentality , " he said .
" this is something that a lot of people in developing countries have .
it is a natural for them to make do with little , and to produce something of value out of nothing . "
commercial waters the majority of the linux community is excited about how their creation is being put to use , both in business and in government .
some worry , though , that large corporations may be reluctant to share their linux-based software with others .
and that , say long-time linux programmers , would violate the tenets of the open source philosophy .
but open source proponent eric raymond says that most linux programmers are happy to spread the gospel .
" in the last five or six years , we 've had a new generation of advocates come out and go public , who are really much more comfortable with collaborating with markets and collaborating with corporations , " he said .
" because hackers are bright people , and they 've figured out that if you want to change the world , one of the things you have to do is co-opt the people who write the big cheques . "
those cheques may soon be getting bigger .
at this year 's recent linuxworld expo in new york , it was clear that corporations , governments and programmers are united by one goal - getting linux onto as many personal computers around the globe as possible .

it is a far cry from the days when the only people who knew about linux were a small community of zealous enthusiasts .
the interest from big companies is helping linux programmers get the recognition they deserve .

but now , the program is going mainstream , reports technology correspondent clark boyd .
some internet cafes in brazil rely on linux major global computer companies are now embracing linux .
ibm , for one , is currently running a series of television and online ads proclaiming that the future is open , as in open source computing .
they have even enlisted author kurt vonnegut to help promote the open source ideal of sharing your computer code with others .
it is a far cry from the days when the only people who knew about linux were a small community of zealous enthusiasts .
the interest from big companies is helping linux programmers get the recognition they deserve .
" it 's helping us get more appreciation from the rest of the world , " said open source guru bruce perens .
" we are no longer isolated geeks making a system only we know is good .
and i think there 's a lot of benefit . "
modify and share the linux operating system was created more than a decade ago by linus torvalds , then just a student at the university of helsinki in finland .
since then , the program has been further refined by programmers worldwide .
linus torvalds : the man who created linux the code of linux is open source , meaning anyone can look at it and modify it , as long as they agree to share their changes with everyone else .
large companies have been benefiting from linux for years now .
they use it to run large servers and networks .
the number one issue for many of these companies is money .
linux can be a low-cost alternative to other , proprietary operating systems like microsoft windows .
because linux is open source , it can be obtained for free , although most companies pay software developers for a package of linux-based applications , including e-mail and word processing .
they also pay for customer support .
but usually not near as much as they would pay to a proprietary vendor .
that is encouraging software developers around the world to make linux-based products .
" i think the market is looking for an alternative to microsoft , " said dan wensley , from net integration technologies in ontario , canada .
" just being an alternative to microsoft in a lot of markets globally will give you an opportunity .
" today , business has adopted linux as an alternative , and as a viable , sometimes better , sometimes as-good-as solution and we 've seen it over last five to six years , develop into a real market and real opportunity and real saleable item , " he said .
saving money linux is also proving popular in the public sector .
governments like the idea of not paying a proprietary vendor huge licensing fees for years and years .
if you spend a dollar with a local company working on linux , that dollar stays in your economy simon phipps , sun microsystems they also like the fact that open source software allows them to modify the code themselves .
" what we see happening in europe is that governments are picking it up , " said marcel hartog of computer associates .
" if you talk to governments , they 're actually thinking - why do n't we write open source software as well .
" so it 's not just cost-based , but also the concept of open source software .
they just like the idea of saving the people money , but also giving back to the people what they created . "
the german city of munich , for one , recently decided to move from windows to linux .
israel and brazil have also begun initiatives to increase their use of open-source solutions .
microsoft rival , sun microsystems , is currently working with the chinese government on open-source software development .
china wants to use linux to create its own , home-grown software industry .
" if you spend a dollar with a local company working on linux , that dollar stays in your economy , " said simon phipps of sun microsystems .
" when you spend a dollar with a multi-national corporation as a license fee for a piece of software , that dollar leaves your country . "
" it 's about keeping the money in your local economy , developing skills and developing the local economy to be strong in its own right in a global context . "
and that is why some think open-source could be the way of the future , especially for developing countries .
dimo calovksi , who works on development issues at the united nations , believes open source could tap into the developing world 's natural strengths .
" in order to be a good information technology professional , to be a developer , programmer , system administrator , one has to have a problem-solving mentality , " he said .
" this is something that a lot of people in developing countries have .
it is a natural for them to make do with little , and to produce something of value out of nothing . "
commercial waters the majority of the linux community is excited about how their creation is being put to use , both in business and in government .
some worry , though , that large corporations may be reluctant to share their linux-based software with others .
and that , say long-time linux programmers , would violate the tenets of the open source philosophy .
but open source proponent eric raymond says that most linux programmers are happy to spread the gospel .
" in the last five or six years , we 've had a new generation of advocates come out and go public , who are really much more comfortable with collaborating with markets and collaborating with corporations , " he said .
" because hackers are bright people , and they 've figured out that if you want to change the world , one of the things you have to do is co-opt the people who write the big cheques . "
those cheques may soon be getting bigger .
at this year 's recent linuxworld expo in new york , it was clear that corporations , governments and programmers are united by one goal - getting linux onto as many personal computers around the globe as possible .
