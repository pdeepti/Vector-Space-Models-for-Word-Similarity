the united nations has proposed an overhaul of its top decision-making group , the security council , which may pave the way for germany to get a permanent seat . the proposal , however , does not offer veto power to new members of the security council . germany , together with japan , india and brazil , have for a long time made their intentions of seeking permanent seats clear .
they have also called for africa to be represented permanently at the un 's inner circle . germany appears willing to sacrifice veto rights in return for winning permanent seats on the united nations security council . " a middle-sized power such as germany does not need the right to a veto , " a senior foreign policy aide to german chancellor gerhard schröder told the financial times . changes to the council require a two-thirds majority in the 191-nation general assembly and the agreement of all five permanent members . russia has not yet indicated its position , while the bush administration has made little secret of its displeasure about germany 's position , following its stance on the iraq war .

un secretary general kofi annan has said the reforms should come up for ratification at the un general assembly in september 2005 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder promised annan the " complete support " of germany and france in instituting the changes .
schröder and chirac phoned annan before making their statements , sources in the french delegation told afp news service .

there have even been calls for annan 's resignation over the issue .
as part of a long-discussed overhaul of the international body - the first in 50 years - a commission formed by annan had suggested enlarging the security council to 24 members , from the current 15 .
in the reform report , due to be officially published on thursday in new york , the 16-member commission had suggested two possible models .
one would have six new permanent and three additional temporary members , and the other would give the council nine new seats , all of them temporary .
japan hopeful germany is pulling for the permanent seats in the hopes that it will get one of them .
however , the names of any new permanent members were n't given .
according to previous reports on the reform plans , germany is working to secure a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed .
japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said his country will use the reform proposals to renew its push for a permanent seat on the security council .
" japan hopes to make use of this chance given the rise in momentum for reforms , " koizumi told kyodo news .
according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats .

italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union .
others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

there have even been calls for annan 's resignation over the issue .
as part of a long-discussed overhaul of the international body - the first in 50 years - a commission formed by annan had suggested enlarging the security council to 24 members , from the current 15 .
in the reform report , due to be officially published on thursday in new york , the 16-member commission had suggested two possible models .
one would have six new permanent and three additional temporary members , and the other would give the council nine new seats , all of them temporary .
japan hopeful germany is pulling for the permanent seats in the hopes that it will get one of them .
however , the names of any new permanent members were n't given .
according to previous reports on the reform plans , germany is working to secure a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed .
japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said his country will use the reform proposals to renew its push for a permanent seat on the security council .
" japan hopes to make use of this chance given the rise in momentum for reforms , " koizumi told kyodo news .
according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats .
major revamp support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union .
others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

hagen dissolved her band in favour of a solo career in 1979 , and went on to achieve a level of notoriety , if not quite fame , both in her home country and abroad . hagen celebrates her 50th birthday in march of next year , but like many other aging rock divas , she shows no sign of slowing down .

hagen 's early attempts at a career in acting failed , but unperturbed , she started her own band . when her step-father was expelled from east germany in 1976 , nina and her mother followed him to the west .
hagen soon secured a recording contract , resulting in the nina hagen band 's eponymous debut punk album .
hagen dissolved her band in favour of a solo career in 1979 , and went on to achieve a level of notoriety , if not quite fame , both in her home country and abroad . hagen celebrates her 50th birthday in march of next year , but like many other aging rock divas , she shows no sign of slowing down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.12.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc deutsche bank announces restructuring deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said on wednesday it planned to eliminate 1,920 jobs in germany in the next two years , or 7 percent of its german workforce , to cut costs .
the jobs to be axed are in administration , information technology services and back office operations , the bank said .
the announcement marked the first major step in the bank 's new strategy to focus on its retail and business activities in germany , which it feels were neglected in recent years in favor of its prestigious investment bank in london .
the job cuts will reduce the workforce in germany from 27,330 to 25,410 .
a total of 2,300 jobs will be affected , but 350 new jobs will be created at subsidiaries within germany , it said .
" through streamlining procedures in transaction processing and administration , we intend to lower costs and become faster , and to concentrate our full attention on our clients , " said jürgen fitschen , head of the bank 's german operations .
deutsche bank said further details of its restructuring plans will be announced in february at its annual news conference . dw-world.de rethinking job protection laws as german unemployment remains high , the debate over whether job protection laws prevent companies from hiring has flared up .

but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .
" there should be and must be an aim for chinese football to win a medal at the 2008 olympics on home soil , " krautzun said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .
" there should be and must be an aim for chinese football to win a medal at the 2008 olympics on home soil , " krautzun said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .
" there should be and must be an aim for chinese football to win a medal at the 2008 olympics on home soil , " krautzun said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

in an interview thursday with financial times deutschland , verhofstadt said he had " great concerns " about some of the suggestions being mooted by chancellor gerhard schröder . germany , has broken the budget deficit cap of three percent of gdp set by the stability pact for three years in a row , and has been calling for certain types of spending , such as research , to be excluded when brussels calculates deficits .
" i am very sceptical about -lrb- the proposals -rrb- " , the belgian leader told the newspaper after a meeting with the chancellor on tuesday .
german finance minister hans eichel complained recently that it was " unfair " that countries paying more money into eu coffers than they receive should then be punished for exceeding the eu 's budgetary threshold . however , according to verhofstadt " a less credible pact could lead to a trend for higher interest . "
that is why the eu should not " move away from the substance of the stability pact . "

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .

according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

the mother of punk is enjoying a rebirth of sorts , with a new film , album and fashion line . some might be tempted to think that nina hagen 's best days are behind her .
the 49-year-old singer is , after all , an icon of the 1980 's in germany .
but somehow , hagen 's distinctive , heavily made-up features keep appearing in the media , and of late , the punk diva has been resolute on expanding her horizons as well as her fan base . the youth-oriented radio station eins live will bestow its annual lifetime achievement " crown " on hagen at an awards ceremony on thursday night . german moviegoers also currently have the chance to see hagen on the big screen alongside her actress daughter , cosma shiva hagen .
appropriately , mom plays the evil queen to cosma 's snow white in a comic production of the classic fairytale . " 1,008 different aspects " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those who prefer hagen when she 's singing , there 's a new album out , though it 's not exactly punk .
proving she 's comfortable with branching out as she matures , hagen instead recorded a selection of swing standards .
and to those who would dare to question her choice , hagen has a ready answer . " because the mother of punk has a 1,008 different aspects and is a unique artist , " hagen said . but how do punk and swing go together , genre purists pressed on ? " hello ?
i 'm the one and only nina hagen on this planet .
just enjoy me , " the mother said , reassuringly . there are more ways now than ever before to enjoy nina hagen .

she was born in 1955 in east berlin to famous actress eva marie hagen and writer hans hagen .
her parents divorced when she was two , and her mother married the dissident poet-songwriter wolf biermann .
hagen 's early attempts at a career in acting failed , but unperturbed , she started her own band . when her step-father was expelled from east germany in 1976 , nina and her mother followed him to the west .
hagen soon secured a recording contract , resulting in the nina hagen band 's eponymous debut punk album .
hagen dissolved her band in favour of a solo career in 1979 , and went on to achieve a level of notoriety , if not quite fame , both in her home country and abroad . hagen celebrates her 50th birthday in march of next year , but like many other aging rock divas , she shows no sign of slowing down .
when asked how she 's dealing with the milestone birthday , hagen said : " just watch me while i 'm working - there 's your answer .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

un secretary general kofi annan has said the reforms should come up for ratification at the un general assembly in september 2005 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder promised annan the " complete support " of germany and france in instituting the changes .
schröder and chirac phoned annan before making their statements , sources in the french delegation told afp news service .
support during crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder in lübeck during the phone call they also offered their " friendship and support " to annan , who is under fire for alleged mismanagement of the scandal-plagued iraq oil-for-food program .
there have even been calls for annan 's resignation over the issue .
as part of a long-discussed overhaul of the international body - the first in 50 years - a commission formed by annan had suggested enlarging the security council to 24 members , from the current 15 .
in the reform report , due to be officially published on thursday in new york , the 16-member commission had suggested two possible models .
one would have six new permanent and three additional temporary members , and the other would give the council nine new seats , all of them temporary .
japan hopeful germany is pulling for the permanent seats in the hopes that it will get one of them .
however , the names of any new permanent members were n't given .
according to previous reports on the reform plans , germany is working to secure a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed .
japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said his country will use the reform proposals to renew its push for a permanent seat on the security council .
" japan hopes to make use of this chance given the rise in momentum for reforms , " koizumi told kyodo news .
according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats .
major revamp support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union .
others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

the mother of punk is enjoying a rebirth of sorts , with a new film , album and fashion line . some might be tempted to think that nina hagen 's best days are behind her .
the 49-year-old singer is , after all , an icon of the 1980 's in germany .
but somehow , hagen 's distinctive , heavily made-up features keep appearing in the media , and of late , the punk diva has been resolute on expanding her horizons as well as her fan base . the youth-oriented radio station eins live will bestow its annual lifetime achievement " crown " on hagen at an awards ceremony on thursday night . german moviegoers also currently have the chance to see hagen on the big screen alongside her actress daughter , cosma shiva hagen .
appropriately , mom plays the evil queen to cosma 's snow white in a comic production of the classic fairytale . " 1,008 different aspects " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those who prefer hagen when she 's singing , there 's a new album out , though it 's not exactly punk .

she was born in 1955 in east berlin to famous actress eva marie hagen and writer hans hagen .
her parents divorced when she was two , and her mother married the dissident poet-songwriter wolf biermann .
hagen 's early attempts at a career in acting failed , but unperturbed , she started her own band . when her step-father was expelled from east germany in 1976 , nina and her mother followed him to the west .
hagen soon secured a recording contract , resulting in the nina hagen band 's eponymous debut punk album .
hagen dissolved her band in favour of a solo career in 1979 , and went on to achieve a level of notoriety , if not quite fame , both in her home country and abroad . hagen celebrates her 50th birthday in march of next year , but like many other aging rock divas , she shows no sign of slowing down .

instead he called on germany to intensify its help in reconstructing iraq . " i did n't come to germany to ask for troops , " allawi wrote in an article published in the thursday issue of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german army soldiers check in for a flight to uae where they train iraqi security forces on former german army trucks and vehicles to make them mechanics and drivers .
so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .
21 the german army has been conducting additional courses there for iraqi soldiers .
still , berlin , which vehemently opposed the us-led invasion of iraq , has taken considerable flack - from washington as well as eu members britain and italy - for categorically ruling out sending troops to help stablize iraq . refusing to comment on the criticisms , allawi praised bilateral relations , which he said were untarnished by a colonial past , and said that german companies too should take part in rebuilding the country .

he demanded that the western world and europe in particular step up their efforts to help african nations overcome their post-colonial problems . köhler , who will travel to sierra leone , benin , ethiopia and djibouti next week , said that fair trade conditions were an important contribution in the fight against poverty in africa .
he added that westerners had to finally realize that the world can not be divided into first , second or third class regions . aid in europe 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees aboard german aid ship cap anamur in sicily in july more development and humanitarian aid for africa would also be in the interest of europe .
security and peace in the industrialized world could not be maintained forever if the problems in africa were being neglected or ignored . " africa is facing big problems and misery , " he said .
" but that ’ s only half the truth .
during my travels in africa i ’ ve also seen much confidence in the future and hope of a scale that you can ’ t even find in the rich countries in europe where constant moaning and groaning is in the order of the day .
i ’ ve seen a magnitude of development projects run by africans who display a level of creativity not seen anywhere else . " the president called on the international community to help building up democratic institutions in african nations as a prerequisite for ensuring law and order .
he said every euro spent on helping create independent courts was a euro well spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south african aids orphan " civil societies are on the rise in many african countries , " he said .
" more and more people are no longer willing to put up with misery and corruption .
there are pressure groups which follow very closely what the government is doing and have no fear of addressing mismanagement and wrongdoings .
women are on the move too , getting more and more involved in social life and important projects to combat aids and poverty . ” unkept promises köhler also praised the african union ’ s endeavors to take africa ’ s problems into its own hands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union logo " i welcome the fact that the african union has left behind the continent ’ s erstwhile principle of non-interference , when it comes to war crimes and genocide , " he said .
" it ’ s sending out a strong signal that africa is willing to deal with its problems on a cross-border basis . " köhler criticized western nations , germany included , for not living up to its decades-old promise of allocating 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to development aid .
germany 's goal is to increase aid to 0.33 percent by 2006 . he also said that almost $ 100 billion -lrb- € 75 billion -rrb- in additional global development aid funds would be required annually to fight poverty effectively - only a tiny fraction of what the rich west spends on armaments every year . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undoing germany 's colonial amnesia germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.12.2004 un reform targets security council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reformers offer two paths to reach the goal of a more efficent un recommendations for reforming the united nations are due on thursday : according to early reports , they include two models to expand the security council .
germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the united nations wave in front of the un headquarters in new york the proposed reforms would be the first major revamp of the organization in more than 50 years and would have to be approved by the un general assembly next september . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us backing italy in security council row ?

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

instead he called on germany to intensify its help in reconstructing iraq . " i did n't come to germany to ask for troops , " allawi wrote in an article published in the thursday issue of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german army soldiers check in for a flight to uae where they train iraqi security forces on former german army trucks and vehicles to make them mechanics and drivers .
so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .
21 the german army has been conducting additional courses there for iraqi soldiers .
still , berlin , which vehemently opposed the us-led invasion of iraq , has taken considerable flack - from washington as well as eu members britain and italy - for categorically ruling out sending troops to help stablize iraq . refusing to comment on the criticisms , allawi praised bilateral relations , which he said were untarnished by a colonial past , and said that german companies too should take part in rebuilding the country .
" no choice " in fallujah in the newspaper article , he wrote that his government was constructing a democracy that was open to all iraqis who support non-violence .
he had ordered military action in fallujah because the rebels there left him no other option , he said . allawi stressed that the majority of iraqis supported his government 's aims : " an iraq governed by iraqis and controlled only by iraqi soldiers and police . "
he said that the fact that iraqis continue to volunteer for the army and the police , despite danger of suicide bombers at recruitment offices , showed that they back the government . he wrote that although the iraqis were grateful for the help of foreign soldiers , they looked forward to the day that the troops would no longer be needed to maintain stability . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato chief criticizes germany 's iraq stance nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer was in berlin monday , warning europe and america not to oppose each other over the iraqi conflict and stressing the need to build consensus within nato .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

" thyssenkrupp has geared itself to the profound changes brought about by globalization .
the platform for thyssenkrupp was the merger in 1999 .
today 's success confirms that this was the right move , " schulz was quoted as saying on the company 's web site . now expansion is the aim for the firm , whose portfolio includes carbon and stainless steel , components and systems for the automobile industry , elevators , escalators , machine tools , materials trading and services as well as industrial services .
in brazil - with its rich iron ore mines - thyssenkrupp is building a $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- steel plant , and in china , where the demand is booming , the company 's investing in steel production and treatment . thyssenkrupp 's sales grew by 11 percent in the past business year - to € 39 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- and orders grew by 17 percent , to € 41 billion .
the company expects even greater growth in coming years . increasing prices , fewer employees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hdw shipbuilders in kiel despite no shortage of orders , production working at full capacity and record earnings , the steel boom is n't all roses for thyssenkrupp managers .
prices for iron ore , coal , coke , alloys , energy and freight have increased significantly .
within a year the price of iron ore rose by around 30 percent and scrap metal went up by nearly 50 percent .
the price for imported coke grew by 110 percent , and both nickel and chrome cost 60 percent more . however , thyssenkrupp 's record profits show that the company took advantage of market opportunities and pushed through higher prices for both steel and stainless steel .
thyssenkrupp production was far higher than the industry average .
the company used the difficult years of the steel crisis to reduce personnel and modernize plants . and it plans to continue restructuring while concentrating on its core business .
besides its strong position in the steel industry , thyssenkrupp is one of the car industry 's largest suppliers .
through new acquisitions , it was able to strengthen its position in the elevator and escalator business in asia as well as in the construction of large facilties , such as complete cement and chemical plants , an area in which its subsidiary uhde is a world leader . thyssenkrupp has planned a merger with howaldtswerken-deutsche werft -lrb- hdw -rrb- shipbuilders , which will strengthen its dominant position building military vessels and allow it to control the market in conventional submarines .
the project has been met with reservations from european union anti-trust authorities .

he demanded that the western world and europe in particular step up their efforts to help african nations overcome their post-colonial problems . köhler , who will travel to sierra leone , benin , ethiopia and djibouti next week , said that fair trade conditions were an important contribution in the fight against poverty in africa .
he added that westerners had to finally realize that the world can not be divided into first , second or third class regions . aid in europe 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees aboard german aid ship cap anamur in sicily in july more development and humanitarian aid for africa would also be in the interest of europe .
security and peace in the industrialized world could not be maintained forever if the problems in africa were being neglected or ignored . " africa is facing big problems and misery , " he said .
" but that ’ s only half the truth .
during my travels in africa i ’ ve also seen much confidence in the future and hope of a scale that you can ’ t even find in the rich countries in europe where constant moaning and groaning is in the order of the day .
i ’ ve seen a magnitude of development projects run by africans who display a level of creativity not seen anywhere else . " the president called on the international community to help building up democratic institutions in african nations as a prerequisite for ensuring law and order .
he said every euro spent on helping create independent courts was a euro well spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south african aids orphan " civil societies are on the rise in many african countries , " he said .
" more and more people are no longer willing to put up with misery and corruption .
there are pressure groups which follow very closely what the government is doing and have no fear of addressing mismanagement and wrongdoings .
women are on the move too , getting more and more involved in social life and important projects to combat aids and poverty . ” unkept promises köhler also praised the african union ’ s endeavors to take africa ’ s problems into its own hands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union logo " i welcome the fact that the african union has left behind the continent ’ s erstwhile principle of non-interference , when it comes to war crimes and genocide , " he said .
" it ’ s sending out a strong signal that africa is willing to deal with its problems on a cross-border basis . " köhler criticized western nations , germany included , for not living up to its decades-old promise of allocating 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to development aid .
germany 's goal is to increase aid to 0.33 percent by 2006 . he also said that almost $ 100 billion -lrb- € 75 billion -rrb- in additional global development aid funds would be required annually to fight poverty effectively - only a tiny fraction of what the rich west spends on armaments every year . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undoing germany 's colonial amnesia germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .

the mother of punk is enjoying a rebirth of sorts , with a new film , album and fashion line . some might be tempted to think that nina hagen 's best days are behind her .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the united nations wave in front of the un headquarters in new york the proposed reforms would be the first major revamp of the organization in more than 50 years and would have to be approved by the un general assembly next september . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us backing italy in security council row ?

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

un secretary general kofi annan has said the reforms should come up for ratification at the un general assembly in september 2005 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder promised annan the " complete support " of germany and france in instituting the changes .
schröder and chirac phoned annan before making their statements , sources in the french delegation told afp news service .
support during crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder in lübeck during the phone call they also offered their " friendship and support " to annan , who is under fire for alleged mismanagement of the scandal-plagued iraq oil-for-food program .
there have even been calls for annan 's resignation over the issue .
as part of a long-discussed overhaul of the international body - the first in 50 years - a commission formed by annan had suggested enlarging the security council to 24 members , from the current 15 .
in the reform report , due to be officially published on thursday in new york , the 16-member commission had suggested two possible models .
one would have six new permanent and three additional temporary members , and the other would give the council nine new seats , all of them temporary .
japan hopeful germany is pulling for the permanent seats in the hopes that it will get one of them .
however , the names of any new permanent members were n't given .
according to previous reports on the reform plans , germany is working to secure a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed .
japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said his country will use the reform proposals to renew its push for a permanent seat on the security council .
" japan hopes to make use of this chance given the rise in momentum for reforms , " koizumi told kyodo news .
according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats .
major revamp support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union .
others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .
the proposed reforms would be the first major revamp of the organization in more than 50 years and would have to be approved by the un general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform targets security council recommendations for reforming the united nations are due on thursday : according to early reports , they include two models to expand the security council .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the united nations wave in front of the un headquarters in new york the proposed reforms would be the first major revamp of the organization in more than 50 years and would have to be approved by the un general assembly next september . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us backing italy in security council row ?

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .
" there should be and must be an aim for chinese football to win a medal at the 2008 olympics on home soil , " krautzun said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

he demanded that the western world and europe in particular step up their efforts to help african nations overcome their post-colonial problems . köhler , who will travel to sierra leone , benin , ethiopia and djibouti next week , said that fair trade conditions were an important contribution in the fight against poverty in africa .

security and peace in the industrialized world could not be maintained forever if the problems in africa were being neglected or ignored . " africa is facing big problems and misery , " he said .
" but that ’ s only half the truth .
during my travels in africa i ’ ve also seen much confidence in the future and hope of a scale that you can ’ t even find in the rich countries in europe where constant moaning and groaning is in the order of the day .
i ’ ve seen a magnitude of development projects run by africans who display a level of creativity not seen anywhere else . " the president called on the international community to help building up democratic institutions in african nations as a prerequisite for ensuring law and order .
he said every euro spent on helping create independent courts was a euro well spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south african aids orphan " civil societies are on the rise in many african countries , " he said .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .
" there should be and must be an aim for chinese football to win a medal at the 2008 olympics on home soil , " krautzun said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

he demanded that the western world and europe in particular step up their efforts to help african nations overcome their post-colonial problems . köhler , who will travel to sierra leone , benin , ethiopia and djibouti next week , said that fair trade conditions were an important contribution in the fight against poverty in africa .
he added that westerners had to finally realize that the world can not be divided into first , second or third class regions . aid in europe 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees aboard german aid ship cap anamur in sicily in july more development and humanitarian aid for africa would also be in the interest of europe .
security and peace in the industrialized world could not be maintained forever if the problems in africa were being neglected or ignored . " africa is facing big problems and misery , " he said .
" but that ’ s only half the truth .
during my travels in africa i ’ ve also seen much confidence in the future and hope of a scale that you can ’ t even find in the rich countries in europe where constant moaning and groaning is in the order of the day .
i ’ ve seen a magnitude of development projects run by africans who display a level of creativity not seen anywhere else . " the president called on the international community to help building up democratic institutions in african nations as a prerequisite for ensuring law and order .
he said every euro spent on helping create independent courts was a euro well spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south african aids orphan " civil societies are on the rise in many african countries , " he said .
" more and more people are no longer willing to put up with misery and corruption .
there are pressure groups which follow very closely what the government is doing and have no fear of addressing mismanagement and wrongdoings .
women are on the move too , getting more and more involved in social life and important projects to combat aids and poverty . ” unkept promises köhler also praised the african union ’ s endeavors to take africa ’ s problems into its own hands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union logo " i welcome the fact that the african union has left behind the continent ’ s erstwhile principle of non-interference , when it comes to war crimes and genocide , " he said .
" it ’ s sending out a strong signal that africa is willing to deal with its problems on a cross-border basis . " köhler criticized western nations , germany included , for not living up to its decades-old promise of allocating 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to development aid .
germany 's goal is to increase aid to 0.33 percent by 2006 . he also said that almost $ 100 billion -lrb- € 75 billion -rrb- in additional global development aid funds would be required annually to fight poverty effectively - only a tiny fraction of what the rich west spends on armaments every year . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undoing germany 's colonial amnesia germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world .

it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

" thyssenkrupp has geared itself to the profound changes brought about by globalization .
the platform for thyssenkrupp was the merger in 1999 .
today 's success confirms that this was the right move , " schulz was quoted as saying on the company 's web site . now expansion is the aim for the firm , whose portfolio includes carbon and stainless steel , components and systems for the automobile industry , elevators , escalators , machine tools , materials trading and services as well as industrial services .
in brazil - with its rich iron ore mines - thyssenkrupp is building a $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- steel plant , and in china , where the demand is booming , the company 's investing in steel production and treatment . thyssenkrupp 's sales grew by 11 percent in the past business year - to € 39 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- and orders grew by 17 percent , to € 41 billion .
the company expects even greater growth in coming years . increasing prices , fewer employees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hdw shipbuilders in kiel despite no shortage of orders , production working at full capacity and record earnings , the steel boom is n't all roses for thyssenkrupp managers .
prices for iron ore , coal , coke , alloys , energy and freight have increased significantly .
within a year the price of iron ore rose by around 30 percent and scrap metal went up by nearly 50 percent .
the price for imported coke grew by 110 percent , and both nickel and chrome cost 60 percent more . however , thyssenkrupp 's record profits show that the company took advantage of market opportunities and pushed through higher prices for both steel and stainless steel .
thyssenkrupp production was far higher than the industry average .
the company used the difficult years of the steel crisis to reduce personnel and modernize plants . and it plans to continue restructuring while concentrating on its core business .
besides its strong position in the steel industry , thyssenkrupp is one of the car industry 's largest suppliers .
through new acquisitions , it was able to strengthen its position in the elevator and escalator business in asia as well as in the construction of large facilties , such as complete cement and chemical plants , an area in which its subsidiary uhde is a world leader . thyssenkrupp has planned a merger with howaldtswerken-deutsche werft -lrb- hdw -rrb- shipbuilders , which will strengthen its dominant position building military vessels and allow it to control the market in conventional submarines .

the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

he demanded that the western world and europe in particular step up their efforts to help african nations overcome their post-colonial problems . köhler , who will travel to sierra leone , benin , ethiopia and djibouti next week , said that fair trade conditions were an important contribution in the fight against poverty in africa .

germany 's goal is to increase aid to 0.33 percent by 2006 . he also said that almost $ 100 billion -lrb- € 75 billion -rrb- in additional global development aid funds would be required annually to fight poverty effectively - only a tiny fraction of what the rich west spends on armaments every year . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undoing germany 's colonial amnesia germany 's colonial past was almost entirely erased from the public 's memory .

the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .

" thyssenkrupp has geared itself to the profound changes brought about by globalization .
the platform for thyssenkrupp was the merger in 1999 .
today 's success confirms that this was the right move , " schulz was quoted as saying on the company 's web site . now expansion is the aim for the firm , whose portfolio includes carbon and stainless steel , components and systems for the automobile industry , elevators , escalators , machine tools , materials trading and services as well as industrial services .
in brazil - with its rich iron ore mines - thyssenkrupp is building a $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- steel plant , and in china , where the demand is booming , the company 's investing in steel production and treatment . thyssenkrupp 's sales grew by 11 percent in the past business year - to € 39 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- and orders grew by 17 percent , to € 41 billion .
the company expects even greater growth in coming years . increasing prices , fewer employees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hdw shipbuilders in kiel despite no shortage of orders , production working at full capacity and record earnings , the steel boom is n't all roses for thyssenkrupp managers .
prices for iron ore , coal , coke , alloys , energy and freight have increased significantly .
within a year the price of iron ore rose by around 30 percent and scrap metal went up by nearly 50 percent .
the price for imported coke grew by 110 percent , and both nickel and chrome cost 60 percent more . however , thyssenkrupp 's record profits show that the company took advantage of market opportunities and pushed through higher prices for both steel and stainless steel .
thyssenkrupp production was far higher than the industry average .
the company used the difficult years of the steel crisis to reduce personnel and modernize plants . and it plans to continue restructuring while concentrating on its core business .
besides its strong position in the steel industry , thyssenkrupp is one of the car industry 's largest suppliers .
through new acquisitions , it was able to strengthen its position in the elevator and escalator business in asia as well as in the construction of large facilties , such as complete cement and chemical plants , an area in which its subsidiary uhde is a world leader . thyssenkrupp has planned a merger with howaldtswerken-deutsche werft -lrb- hdw -rrb- shipbuilders , which will strengthen its dominant position building military vessels and allow it to control the market in conventional submarines .
the project has been met with reservations from european union anti-trust authorities .

instead he called on germany to intensify its help in reconstructing iraq . " i did n't come to germany to ask for troops , " allawi wrote in an article published in the thursday issue of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german army soldiers check in for a flight to uae where they train iraqi security forces on former german army trucks and vehicles to make them mechanics and drivers .
so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .
21 the german army has been conducting additional courses there for iraqi soldiers .
still , berlin , which vehemently opposed the us-led invasion of iraq , has taken considerable flack - from washington as well as eu members britain and italy - for categorically ruling out sending troops to help stablize iraq . refusing to comment on the criticisms , allawi praised bilateral relations , which he said were untarnished by a colonial past , and said that german companies too should take part in rebuilding the country .
" no choice " in fallujah in the newspaper article , he wrote that his government was constructing a democracy that was open to all iraqis who support non-violence .
he had ordered military action in fallujah because the rebels there left him no other option , he said . allawi stressed that the majority of iraqis supported his government 's aims : " an iraq governed by iraqis and controlled only by iraqi soldiers and police . "
he said that the fact that iraqis continue to volunteer for the army and the police , despite danger of suicide bombers at recruitment offices , showed that they back the government . he wrote that although the iraqis were grateful for the help of foreign soldiers , they looked forward to the day that the troops would no longer be needed to maintain stability . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato chief criticizes germany 's iraq stance nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer was in berlin monday , warning europe and america not to oppose each other over the iraqi conflict and stressing the need to build consensus within nato .

the mother of punk is enjoying a rebirth of sorts , with a new film , album and fashion line . some might be tempted to think that nina hagen 's best days are behind her .
the 49-year-old singer is , after all , an icon of the 1980 's in germany .
but somehow , hagen 's distinctive , heavily made-up features keep appearing in the media , and of late , the punk diva has been resolute on expanding her horizons as well as her fan base . the youth-oriented radio station eins live will bestow its annual lifetime achievement " crown " on hagen at an awards ceremony on thursday night . german moviegoers also currently have the chance to see hagen on the big screen alongside her actress daughter , cosma shiva hagen .

" 1,008 different aspects " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those who prefer hagen when she 's singing , there 's a new album out , though it 's not exactly punk .
proving she 's comfortable with branching out as she matures , hagen instead recorded a selection of swing standards .
and to those who would dare to question her choice , hagen has a ready answer . " because the mother of punk has a 1,008 different aspects and is a unique artist , " hagen said . but how do punk and swing go together , genre purists pressed on ? " hello ?

mother of punk . colorful past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model wears a dress from the nina hagen mother of punk collection hagen 's biography is just as colorful as her resume .
she was born in 1955 in east berlin to famous actress eva marie hagen and writer hans hagen .
her parents divorced when she was two , and her mother married the dissident poet-songwriter wolf biermann .
hagen 's early attempts at a career in acting failed , but unperturbed , she started her own band . when her step-father was expelled from east germany in 1976 , nina and her mother followed him to the west .
hagen soon secured a recording contract , resulting in the nina hagen band 's eponymous debut punk album .
hagen dissolved her band in favour of a solo career in 1979 , and went on to achieve a level of notoriety , if not quite fame , both in her home country and abroad . hagen celebrates her 50th birthday in march of next year , but like many other aging rock divas , she shows no sign of slowing down .

un secretary general kofi annan has said the reforms should come up for ratification at the un general assembly in september 2005 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder promised annan the " complete support " of germany and france in instituting the changes .
schröder and chirac phoned annan before making their statements , sources in the french delegation told afp news service .
support during crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder in lübeck during the phone call they also offered their " friendship and support " to annan , who is under fire for alleged mismanagement of the scandal-plagued iraq oil-for-food program .
there have even been calls for annan 's resignation over the issue .
as part of a long-discussed overhaul of the international body - the first in 50 years - a commission formed by annan had suggested enlarging the security council to 24 members , from the current 15 .
in the reform report , due to be officially published on thursday in new york , the 16-member commission had suggested two possible models .
one would have six new permanent and three additional temporary members , and the other would give the council nine new seats , all of them temporary .
japan hopeful germany is pulling for the permanent seats in the hopes that it will get one of them .
however , the names of any new permanent members were n't given .
according to previous reports on the reform plans , germany is working to secure a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed .
japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said his country will use the reform proposals to renew its push for a permanent seat on the security council .
" japan hopes to make use of this chance given the rise in momentum for reforms , " koizumi told kyodo news .
according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats .
major revamp support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union .
others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .
it is hoped that the players who hone their skills in germany will form the core of the 2008 olympic team and that they will bring honor and glory back to the chinese game . to dig out more potential players , scouting will continue throughout the two-year course and both chinese officials and coaches appear optimistic that the result will be a good display in 2008 .
" there should be and must be an aim for chinese football to win a medal at the 2008 olympics on home soil , " krautzun said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .

in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds .

china may be down and out in one sense , but the future is far from the grim picture painted by some critics . in a bid to rebuild china 's beleaguered national soccer team , the chinese football association -lrb- cfa -rrb- is sending a specially assembled group called the 2008 star team , consisting of 27 young and promising chinese soccer players , to germany to improve its fortunes . the cfa is hoping that training and playing with the germans can provide the inspiration to build a highly organized , diligent , mighty soccer force . the young players of the star team , aged between 15 and 19 , will arrive on dec .
8 to begin two years of training at the bad kissingen training center in southern germany , a complex known for its advanced sports training and recuperation facilities . the chinese players will also get the chance to experience some south american skills when they spend three to four months in argentina competing against youth squads attached to top teams such as rio plate . training course a long term basis " we chose bad kissingen because germany is a giant in the game and we want to use their knowledge as a long-term training basis for china 's football , " said nan yong , vice president of the cfa , in an interview with the chinese people ’ s daily newspaper .
" we want to build an exchange platform with europe 's top football nations in terms of youth training , coaching and team training , " nan added . the star team will be coached by veteran professional coach eckhard krautzun , who has led clubs in the us , japan , saudi arabia and tunisia .
krautzen will be assisted by three chinese coaches who are traveling with the young players , a german stamina coach and a goalkeeping trainer . german coach sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese supporters " i had coaching experience with competitions at club , national and international levels .
i have attended the coaching courses in german and spain , " said krautzun in the people ’ s daily .
" i should thank the china 's football association for giving me such a chance , and i believe the team will show a great improvement in the following years . " there will be little time for the young chinese stars to get used to their new surroundings before they are required to show what they are made of .
the star team faces an official match every week and international matches every month as part of their training , and the team will face the german under-19 team in a friendly on dec .
18 in stuttgart . " i will send two players to each german bundesliga club .
the clubs told me that they are willing to have chinese players to train with them , " said krautzun .
" we will play matches all over europe and make sure they get used to different styles and levels of football . " education goes hand-in-hand with soccer skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese stars will have to learn german and english as well as football skills .
as well as experiencing european and south american soccer matches and training schedules , the chinese players will also be expected to excel in their off-pitch education , an idea well received by the cfa .
chinese professional footballers have found themselves under fire at times for their lack of literacy and education , leading to questionable behavior on and off the pitch . " we will have education in germany .
you can not develop mentally if you just play football from morning to evening .
without the mental capability , they will not know how to win matches in the future , " said krautzun .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- will attend english and german classes regularly and lectures to develop their psychological and mental ability . " chinese soccer in crisis the failure to qualify for the 2006 world cup , ironically being staged in the star team ’ s temporary home country , has compounded the problems that chinese soccer has experienced of late .
allegations of biased refereeing , match-fixing and player walk-offs have sent the nation 's football league spiraling into chaos in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china beat hong kong convincingly but the goal difference was n't enough to see them through in the world cup qualifiers .

instead he called on germany to intensify its help in reconstructing iraq . " i did n't come to germany to ask for troops , " allawi wrote in an article published in the thursday issue of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .

he said that the fact that iraqis continue to volunteer for the army and the police , despite danger of suicide bombers at recruitment offices , showed that they back the government . he wrote that although the iraqis were grateful for the help of foreign soldiers , they looked forward to the day that the troops would no longer be needed to maintain stability . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato chief criticizes germany 's iraq stance nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer was in berlin monday , warning europe and america not to oppose each other over the iraqi conflict and stressing the need to build consensus within nato .

the families of four british soldiers who died at a training barracks are calling for a public inquiry . each year , thousands of new army recruits pass through the deepcut barracks in surrey for basic training .
but since the mid-1990 's there have been many claims of bullying by trainees and of stories of humiliation during training .
the most severe allegations surround the deaths of four recruits aged between 17 and 20 who trained at deepcut between 1995 and 2001 .
british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .
military officials cited suicide , but a coroner who investigated the case recorded an open verdict . private james collinson , 17 , killed by a single gun shot , was apparently happy and according to his parents had no reason to kill himself . geoff gray , a 17-year-old private , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head .
again , the army said it was suicide but the coroner heard evidence of someone running from the scene . geoff ’ s parents , who did not even know their son had been shot twice until six months later , say no proper investigation of his death has ever taken place . " we have spent two and a half years trying to find out how our son lost his life , " gray 's father , also geoff , said in written evidence to the house of commons defense committee looking into the treatment of armed forces recruits .
" documents were destroyed , examination of forensic evidence -lrb- was -rrb- not carried out .
in the course of our quest for truth , we have become aware of more and more families in a similar position . " culture of bullying ? a police probe into the deaths of the four recruits uncovered 173 allegations of abuse , including claims of rape , racism , and beatings .
the deepcut families are pushing members of parliament to launch a full , public inquiry . the british armed forces minister , adam ingram , told the house of commons that the report was not proof of a culture of abuse at deepcut . " violence and intimidation are not the means by which the army produces the soldiers it needs , " ingram said in a statement on tuesday .
" our policy continues to be to bear down on such behavior hard , and as far as is possible , to eradicate it completely from our bases and training grounds . " ingram insisted everything possible is being done to get to the bottom of the situation at deepcut and said anyone found guilty of bullying or abusing recruits will be dealt with .
however , he said that an independent inquiry was unnecessary . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense minister joins abuse investigation germany 's top military official meets with military officials on wednesday to discuss the allegations of abuse at training camps which are threatening to engulf the armed forces in a damaging scandal .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .
italy , which locked heads with germany and france over europe 's role in iraq , worries giving a council seat to germany , in addition to the two permanent seats already occupied by france and britain , would weaken its role in the european union . others favoring the plan to introduce eight semi-permanent seats include pakistan , which rejects india 's place on the council and mexico and argentine , which oppose brazil 's claims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of the united nations wave in front of the un headquarters in new york the proposed reforms would be the first major revamp of the organization in more than 50 years and would have to be approved by the un general assembly next september . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us backing italy in security council row ?

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .
while britain , france and russia have indicated support for the aspirations of these four countries , the us has so far refused to give germany a nod of approval .
bush administration officials have , however , voiced their support for japan , a supporter of the iraq war unlike germany . according to reuters , nigeria , south africa and egypt would compete for the african seats . the italian alternative support for the second version comes from countries such as italy , a us ally in iraq and a strong opponent of handing a permanent seat to germany .

germany remains hopeful it will get permanent membership . expanding the council , the un 's central decision-making body , from 15 to 24 members is one of the main suggestions included in the reform recommendations , according to german public broadcaster ard and reuters news service . on a more general basis , the high-profile panel charged with drawing up reform plans reportedly suggests that the council needs to be " more representative of the broader membership , especially of the developing world . "
it also states that the council is the un 's body " most capable of organizing action and capable of responding rapidly to new threats . " two competing models bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york while clear on the need to expand the council , which currently has five permanent members with veto powers and 10 non-permanent members , the reform panel has drawn up two competing models . the first one would add six new permanent members without veto powers - two from africa , two from asia and one each from the americas and europe .
it would also add three non-permanent members with a two-year term like the ones currently elected to sit on the body . the second option would add eight new seats for semi-permanent members , which would be elected for four years and could have their terms extended .
africa , asia , europe and the americas would each get two of these seats and one additional non-permanent member would also be added . germany 's favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary general kofi annan -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister joschka fischer both versions have backers : the first model is supported by german officials , who hope to secure one of the new permanent seats for the country .
according to ard and reuters , germany intends to introduce a resolution in support of this model as soon as possible and is working on securing a two-thirds majority in the 191-member nation general assembly that 's needed to get it passed . japan , brazil and india support the plan as well as they all hope for permanent seats for themselves .

the mother of punk is enjoying a rebirth of sorts , with a new film , album and fashion line . some might be tempted to think that nina hagen 's best days are behind her .
the 49-year-old singer is , after all , an icon of the 1980 's in germany .
but somehow , hagen 's distinctive , heavily made-up features keep appearing in the media , and of late , the punk diva has been resolute on expanding her horizons as well as her fan base . the youth-oriented radio station eins live will bestow its annual lifetime achievement " crown " on hagen at an awards ceremony on thursday night . german moviegoers also currently have the chance to see hagen on the big screen alongside her actress daughter , cosma shiva hagen .
appropriately , mom plays the evil queen to cosma 's snow white in a comic production of the classic fairytale . " 1,008 different aspects " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those who prefer hagen when she 's singing , there 's a new album out , though it 's not exactly punk .
proving she 's comfortable with branching out as she matures , hagen instead recorded a selection of swing standards .
and to those who would dare to question her choice , hagen has a ready answer . " because the mother of punk has a 1,008 different aspects and is a unique artist , " hagen said . but how do punk and swing go together , genre purists pressed on ? " hello ?
i 'm the one and only nina hagen on this planet .
just enjoy me , " the mother said , reassuringly . there are more ways now than ever before to enjoy nina hagen .
even if you 're not into her music or her movies , you can still snap up one of the ultra-hip items from her new line of clothing and accessories , called - what else ?
mother of punk . colorful past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model wears a dress from the nina hagen mother of punk collection hagen 's biography is just as colorful as her resume .
she was born in 1955 in east berlin to famous actress eva marie hagen and writer hans hagen .
her parents divorced when she was two , and her mother married the dissident poet-songwriter wolf biermann .
hagen 's early attempts at a career in acting failed , but unperturbed , she started her own band . when her step-father was expelled from east germany in 1976 , nina and her mother followed him to the west .
hagen soon secured a recording contract , resulting in the nina hagen band 's eponymous debut punk album .
hagen dissolved her band in favour of a solo career in 1979 , and went on to achieve a level of notoriety , if not quite fame , both in her home country and abroad . hagen celebrates her 50th birthday in march of next year , but like many other aging rock divas , she shows no sign of slowing down .
when asked how she 's dealing with the milestone birthday , hagen said : " just watch me while i 'm working - there 's your answer .

british army officials found the four had committed suicide , but their relatives insist they were happy with their careers and believe they were victims of a culture of fear and violence . mysterious deaths private sean benton , 20 , died with five bullet wounds to his chest , but even though ballistics evidence found that four had been fired from a distance , british army officials said he had killed himself . private cheryl james , 18 , suffered a single bullet wound to her head .

it wants to make childcare affordable for all parents of three and four year- old children .
it also wants to provide care for all pupils up to age 14 at schools between the hours of 0800 and 1800 .
the plans are likely to see an increase in the number of children 's centres providing health and education .
bbc education and social affairs correspondent kim catcheside said : " at the moment , parents pay about three-quarters of the national bill , and childcare in the uk is amongst the most expensive in europe .
" the chancellor could help by subsidising nurseries or by increasing tax credits and tax relief . "
chancellor gordon brown is also expected to announce an extension to maternity leave to 12 months , which could also be offered to fathers .

naim dangoor is funding scholarships of £ 1,000 each for 1,000 students taking up places at the 1994 group of universities which includes uea .
the 91-year-old jewish businessman fled to england to escape anti-semitic persecution in iraq in the 1960s .
mr dangoor said he had always hoped to help a british student .
the 1994 group universities are : uea , bath , birkbeck college , london , durham , essex , exeter , goldsmiths college , london , lancaster , london school of economics , reading , royal holloway , london , st andrews , surrey , sussex , warwick and york .
candidates with potential mr dangoor added : " i promised myself that if i was ever able to help a british university student i would , to assist the native people of the country that welcomed me .
" but i never dreamt i would be able to make such a big contribution . "
director of access and admissions at uea , david marshall , said : " a number of participating universities will place a special emphasis on supporting applicants from backgrounds where there is little tradition of university education .
" at uea we are particularly keen to attract candidates with real potential from such backgrounds into science subjects . "
mr dangoor added : " if the scheme is successful we will continue it year after year , and i hope it will attract others to do the same . "
the dangoor scholarships - to be launched on thursday - will be available to students starting their courses in 2005 .

the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices .
there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system .
growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1 % , and corporate investment is growing at more than 25 % a year .
the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9 % for more than a year .
rapid tooling-up of china 's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year .
in theory , the government has a 7 % growth target , but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a " hard landing " in the shape of an overbalancing economy .
a low exchange rate - china 's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar , which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets .
china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg .
to some extent , the credit controls do seem to be taking effect .
industrial output grew 15.7 % in the year to october , down from 23 % in february , and inflation slowed to 4.3 % - although retail sales are still booming .

the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices .
there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system .
growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1 % , and corporate investment is growing at more than 25 % a year .
the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9 % for more than a year .
rapid tooling-up of china 's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year .
in theory , the government has a 7 % growth target , but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a " hard landing " in the shape of an overbalancing economy .
a low exchange rate - china 's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar , which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets .
china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg .
to some extent , the credit controls do seem to be taking effect .
industrial output grew 15.7 % in the year to october , down from 23 % in february , and inflation slowed to 4.3 % - although retail sales are still booming .

they 've collaborated on a book of photographs of women living with hiv and aids , from around the world .
it 's part of a campaign - with the actress bianca jagger - to raise awareness of hiv and aids .
breakfast talked live to mario testino and kenneth cole , about the photographs kenneth cole explained how our ideas about aids and hiv have changed in a decade : " the face of aids , even 10 years ago , was a man , probably gay , possibly haitian or a drug user .
" now , 14,000 people are contracting hiv / aids every day .
there are 42 million people living with aids and hiv in the world . "
as a world-famous photographer , mario testino was approached by the charity marie stopes international .
women living with aids from around the world were flown to london for the photographs .
" i thought i would make the women look as glamourous as any woman , " mario testino explained .
" there are women in this book who could be my mother or my cousin . "
kenneth cole is concerned that we may have become complacent : people with hiv and aids are living far longer - but we still do n't have a cure .
so , for him , the only message is still to protect yourself against infection in the first place .
