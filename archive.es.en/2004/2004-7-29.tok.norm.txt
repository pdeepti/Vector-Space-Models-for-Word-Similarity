collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .
" i hope the same thing will happen as with the -lrb- russian -rrb- mir space station , " said feustel-büechl .
" mir was designed for a life of seven years but was used for 15 . " daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's great space race with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ?
-lrb- july 11 , 2004 -rrb- esa and the eu in the past year , the european union drafted its first space policy and even cemented space as an eu competency in the draft constitution .
its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams .
-lrb- july 11 , 2004 -rrb- europe creates its own space vehicle the european space agency designed its automated transfer vehicle to handle the logistics of the international space station .
once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- the second coming of columbus europe 's columbus research module will help scientists learn about the effects of space travel on humans and more .
the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is iss a waste of money or a good example of international cooperation in science ?

the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands . the study aims to provide insights into the perceptions and attitudes of germans towards the uk and vice versa .
those polled were young people from the two countries , who were of particular interest for both the cultural institutions involved in the project . germans think uk is modern and multi-cultural the study shows that of all the young germans polled , over 50 percent have visited the uk .
a whopping 97 percent have at least a basic knowledge of the english language .
britain is only second to the usa when it comes to being the most popular country for studies abroad .
all in all , young germans view the uk as a successful multi-cultural society which is modern and future-oriented . britain is also considered to be a country where important trends are set , for instance in the art and music scenes .
it ’ s not perceived as a country committed to the ideals of the european union .
on the other hand , only 37 percent of the young britons polled have been to germany . brit kids think " krauts " are not trendy germany is not really a country they tend to think of in terms of studying there .
it ’ s not seen to be trendy , but most young britons mention germany ’ s technological capabilities and its drive for perfection and precision , as , for instance , in the car industry . the struggle against stereotypes is a hard one .
many young britons still believe that germans are not open-minded and – even worse – without any sense of humor .
but according to the study , the overall rating of germans among young britons is slowly but surely improving .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .
they maintain he is reluctant to endorse any element of bush 's iraq policy which could help him into a second term in the presidential elections later this year . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .
they maintain he is reluctant to endorse any element of bush 's iraq policy which could help him into a second term in the presidential elections later this year . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .
buissoniere added that the us 's blurring the boundaries between aid workers and military personnel was " endangering the lives of humanitarian workers and jeopardizing aid to people in need . "
killed by the taliban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters claimed responsibility for the killings of five msf workers in june .
the organization also accused the afghan government of failing to conduct a proper investigation into the murder of the aid workers , who were ambushed in their clearly marked vehicle on a rural road near badghis in the northwestern part of the country .
all five - three europeans and two afghans - were shot dead , and taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility .
police initially arrested around a dozen people , but all were later released .
the islamic fundamentalist taliban , which was forced from power during the us-led war in 2001 , has said that it regards aid workers as legitimate targets .
more than 20 have been killed in afghanistan this year alone .
and on wednesday , msf said the country had become far too dangerous for its workers .
msf officials also stated that the context in which humanitarian organizations have to work in the country is making it almost impossible to provide aid to the afghan people .
much of the south and eastern parts of afghanistan are effectively off-limits , and the northern region is quickly becoming a no-go zone , too .
only the capital , kabul , which is guarded by international troops , is relatively secure .
msf ’ s withdrawal represents a serious blow to the afghan government , which is heavily reliant on foreign organizations to provide humanitarian assistance .
it also highlights the worsening security situation in the run-up to the presidential elections scheduled for this october .
us ' regrets ' pullout the united states said wednesday that it " regretted " the decision and asked the aid organization to reconsider its move .
however , the state department also rejected msf 's claim that washington was using humanitarian aid to further political or military goals . "
we 've never conditioned our aid on cooperation with military operations , " state department deputy spokesman adam ereli told reporters .
" we strongly reject any allegation that our actions have made it more dangerous for humanitarian workers to assist the people of afghanistan . "
nevertheless , us officials still asked the group to stay on in afghanistan .
" they are doing important and invaluable work there , " ereli said .
a domino effect ?
the organization has been working in afghanistan for 24 years , and the nobel prize-winning ngo has 80 foreign and 1,400 afghan staff in the country .
many operations were suspended immediately after the attack in june .
its decision to pull out is likely to have a domino effect , prompting other aid organizations to reconsider their involvement there .
since may , the organization has repeatedly claimed that humanitarian aid was being " co-opted " by the us military .
msf officials have said that they were extremely concerned about leaflets being distributed by coalition forces .
these included a picture of an afghan girl carrying a bag of wheat , and linked the continued provision of humanitarian aid with the local population ’ s willingness to pass on information relating to the taliban , al qaida , and other militant groups .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .
" i hope the same thing will happen as with the -lrb- russian -rrb- mir space station , " said feustel-büechl .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .
" i hope the same thing will happen as with the -lrb- russian -rrb- mir space station , " said feustel-büechl .
" mir was designed for a life of seven years but was used for 15 .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .
buissoniere added that the us 's blurring the boundaries between aid workers and military personnel was " endangering the lives of humanitarian workers and jeopardizing aid to people in need . "
killed by the taliban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters claimed responsibility for the killings of five msf workers in june .
the organization also accused the afghan government of failing to conduct a proper investigation into the murder of the aid workers , who were ambushed in their clearly marked vehicle on a rural road near badghis in the northwestern part of the country .
all five - three europeans and two afghans - were shot dead , and taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility .
police initially arrested around a dozen people , but all were later released .
the islamic fundamentalist taliban , which was forced from power during the us-led war in 2001 , has said that it regards aid workers as legitimate targets .
more than 20 have been killed in afghanistan this year alone .
and on wednesday , msf said the country had become far too dangerous for its workers .
msf officials also stated that the context in which humanitarian organizations have to work in the country is making it almost impossible to provide aid to the afghan people .
much of the south and eastern parts of afghanistan are effectively off-limits , and the northern region is quickly becoming a no-go zone , too .
only the capital , kabul , which is guarded by international troops , is relatively secure .
msf ’ s withdrawal represents a serious blow to the afghan government , which is heavily reliant on foreign organizations to provide humanitarian assistance .
it also highlights the worsening security situation in the run-up to the presidential elections scheduled for this october .
us ' regrets ' pullout the united states said wednesday that it " regretted " the decision and asked the aid organization to reconsider its move .
however , the state department also rejected msf 's claim that washington was using humanitarian aid to further political or military goals . "
we 've never conditioned our aid on cooperation with military operations , " state department deputy spokesman adam ereli told reporters .
" we strongly reject any allegation that our actions have made it more dangerous for humanitarian workers to assist the people of afghanistan . "
nevertheless , us officials still asked the group to stay on in afghanistan .
" they are doing important and invaluable work there , " ereli said .
a domino effect ?
the organization has been working in afghanistan for 24 years , and the nobel prize-winning ngo has 80 foreign and 1,400 afghan staff in the country .
many operations were suspended immediately after the attack in june .
its decision to pull out is likely to have a domino effect , prompting other aid organizations to reconsider their involvement there .
since may , the organization has repeatedly claimed that humanitarian aid was being " co-opted " by the us military .
msf officials have said that they were extremely concerned about leaflets being distributed by coalition forces .
these included a picture of an afghan girl carrying a bag of wheat , and linked the continued provision of humanitarian aid with the local population ’ s willingness to pass on information relating to the taliban , al qaida , and other militant groups .
msf accused the coalition forces of attempting to usurp and misrepresent the provision of aid , and warned that such tactics would increase the danger for aid workers . dw staff -lrb- sk / dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life in afghanistan a dw-world special report on life in post-war afghanistan , where millions are building new lives after two decades of civil war .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .
buissoniere added that the us 's blurring the boundaries between aid workers and military personnel was " endangering the lives of humanitarian workers and jeopardizing aid to people in need . "
killed by the taliban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters claimed responsibility for the killings of five msf workers in june .
the organization also accused the afghan government of failing to conduct a proper investigation into the murder of the aid workers , who were ambushed in their clearly marked vehicle on a rural road near badghis in the northwestern part of the country .
all five - three europeans and two afghans - were shot dead , and taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility .
police initially arrested around a dozen people , but all were later released .
the islamic fundamentalist taliban , which was forced from power during the us-led war in 2001 , has said that it regards aid workers as legitimate targets .
more than 20 have been killed in afghanistan this year alone .
and on wednesday , msf said the country had become far too dangerous for its workers .
msf officials also stated that the context in which humanitarian organizations have to work in the country is making it almost impossible to provide aid to the afghan people .
much of the south and eastern parts of afghanistan are effectively off-limits , and the northern region is quickly becoming a no-go zone , too .
only the capital , kabul , which is guarded by international troops , is relatively secure .
msf ’ s withdrawal represents a serious blow to the afghan government , which is heavily reliant on foreign organizations to provide humanitarian assistance .
it also highlights the worsening security situation in the run-up to the presidential elections scheduled for this october .
us ' regrets ' pullout the united states said wednesday that it " regretted " the decision and asked the aid organization to reconsider its move .
however , the state department also rejected msf 's claim that washington was using humanitarian aid to further political or military goals . "
we 've never conditioned our aid on cooperation with military operations , " state department deputy spokesman adam ereli told reporters .
" we strongly reject any allegation that our actions have made it more dangerous for humanitarian workers to assist the people of afghanistan . "
nevertheless , us officials still asked the group to stay on in afghanistan .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .
washington accuses tehran of using its civilian atomic energy program to mask development of nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to take up the issue and possibly impose sanctions .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .
washington accuses tehran of using its civilian atomic energy program to mask development of nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to take up the issue and possibly impose sanctions .
europe has been working closely with iran to persuade it to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors and to allay western doubts in order to prevent an escalation of the crisis .

just do n't mention the war traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding current affairs -pipe- 29.07.2004 british and german kids struggle with clichés großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british kids apparently have a less than progressive view of germany a new british-german study carried out by two cultural organizations shows what kids from both countries think of each other , and it seems stereotypes still abound . in berlin on thursday , the british council and the german goethe institute presented a new study which looks at what young people in the uk and germany think about each other ’ s countries .
the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands . the study aims to provide insights into the perceptions and attitudes of germans towards the uk and vice versa .
those polled were young people from the two countries , who were of particular interest for both the cultural institutions involved in the project . germans think uk is modern and multi-cultural the study shows that of all the young germans polled , over 50 percent have visited the uk .
a whopping 97 percent have at least a basic knowledge of the english language .
britain is only second to the usa when it comes to being the most popular country for studies abroad .
all in all , young germans view the uk as a successful multi-cultural society which is modern and future-oriented . britain is also considered to be a country where important trends are set , for instance in the art and music scenes .
it ’ s not perceived as a country committed to the ideals of the european union .
on the other hand , only 37 percent of the young britons polled have been to germany . brit kids think " krauts " are not trendy germany is not really a country they tend to think of in terms of studying there .
it ’ s not seen to be trendy , but most young britons mention germany ’ s technological capabilities and its drive for perfection and precision , as , for instance , in the car industry . the struggle against stereotypes is a hard one .
many young britons still believe that germans are not open-minded and – even worse – without any sense of humor .
but according to the study , the overall rating of germans among young britons is slowly but surely improving .
or , as one of those polled put it : “ the krauts are okay ! ” hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de examining germany 's image abroad discipline , industriousness and a good education are the characteristics most americans and russians associate with germans , according to a new survey commissioned by deutsche welle .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2004 historians split on german wwi role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand set events in motion aug .
1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view .

just do n't mention the war traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding current affairs -pipe- 29.07.2004 british and german kids struggle with clichés großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british kids apparently have a less than progressive view of germany a new british-german study carried out by two cultural organizations shows what kids from both countries think of each other , and it seems stereotypes still abound . in berlin on thursday , the british council and the german goethe institute presented a new study which looks at what young people in the uk and germany think about each other ’ s countries .
the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands . the study aims to provide insights into the perceptions and attitudes of germans towards the uk and vice versa .
those polled were young people from the two countries , who were of particular interest for both the cultural institutions involved in the project . germans think uk is modern and multi-cultural the study shows that of all the young germans polled , over 50 percent have visited the uk .
a whopping 97 percent have at least a basic knowledge of the english language .
britain is only second to the usa when it comes to being the most popular country for studies abroad .
all in all , young germans view the uk as a successful multi-cultural society which is modern and future-oriented . britain is also considered to be a country where important trends are set , for instance in the art and music scenes .
it ’ s not perceived as a country committed to the ideals of the european union .
on the other hand , only 37 percent of the young britons polled have been to germany . brit kids think " krauts " are not trendy germany is not really a country they tend to think of in terms of studying there .
it ’ s not seen to be trendy , but most young britons mention germany ’ s technological capabilities and its drive for perfection and precision , as , for instance , in the car industry . the struggle against stereotypes is a hard one .
many young britons still believe that germans are not open-minded and – even worse – without any sense of humor .
but according to the study , the overall rating of germans among young britons is slowly but surely improving .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .

" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

"
he acknowledged that spain has re-joined the european family after the departure of his predecessor jose maria aznar , who had " one foot in europe ... and one outside to slow it down . "
zapatero applauded the 25 countries in europe for being able to " adopt a constitution , give up a part of their sovereignty and unite their economies . "
the spaniard is confident his people will vote for the european constitution , saying , " the spanish are convinced that spain has the weight it deserves because , in a europe of 25 , the percentages and alliances will be different .
there will be ample support for the constitution . "
despite this , he hinted that the language of the text could be revised to make it simpler to understand .
" we will need a large translation effort , because the public language of the eu is far removed from good literature , " he noted . -lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- www-links euobserver.com the latest in eu-related news more briefs 28.07.2004 -pipe- sudan will ' resist ' foreign forces 28.07.2004 -pipe- report warns of slow euro zone recovery 28.07.2004 -pipe- eu big three to have nuclear talks with iran 27.07.2004 -pipe- prodi prepares return to italian politics 27.07.2004 -pipe- brussels scraps ' made in europe ' label 27.07.2004 -pipe- french propose barrot as eu commissioner 26.07.2004 -pipe- key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy 26.07.2004 -pipe- spain to vote on eu constitution in february radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands . the study aims to provide insights into the perceptions and attitudes of germans towards the uk and vice versa .
those polled were young people from the two countries , who were of particular interest for both the cultural institutions involved in the project . germans think uk is modern and multi-cultural the study shows that of all the young germans polled , over 50 percent have visited the uk .
a whopping 97 percent have at least a basic knowledge of the english language .
britain is only second to the usa when it comes to being the most popular country for studies abroad .
all in all , young germans view the uk as a successful multi-cultural society which is modern and future-oriented . britain is also considered to be a country where important trends are set , for instance in the art and music scenes .
it ’ s not perceived as a country committed to the ideals of the european union .
on the other hand , only 37 percent of the young britons polled have been to germany . brit kids think " krauts " are not trendy germany is not really a country they tend to think of in terms of studying there .
it ’ s not seen to be trendy , but most young britons mention germany ’ s technological capabilities and its drive for perfection and precision , as , for instance , in the car industry . the struggle against stereotypes is a hard one .
many young britons still believe that germans are not open-minded and – even worse – without any sense of humor .
but according to the study , the overall rating of germans among young britons is slowly but surely improving .

the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands . the study aims to provide insights into the perceptions and attitudes of germans towards the uk and vice versa .
those polled were young people from the two countries , who were of particular interest for both the cultural institutions involved in the project . germans think uk is modern and multi-cultural the study shows that of all the young germans polled , over 50 percent have visited the uk .
a whopping 97 percent have at least a basic knowledge of the english language .
britain is only second to the usa when it comes to being the most popular country for studies abroad .
all in all , young germans view the uk as a successful multi-cultural society which is modern and future-oriented . britain is also considered to be a country where important trends are set , for instance in the art and music scenes .
it ’ s not perceived as a country committed to the ideals of the european union .
on the other hand , only 37 percent of the young britons polled have been to germany . brit kids think " krauts " are not trendy germany is not really a country they tend to think of in terms of studying there .
it ’ s not seen to be trendy , but most young britons mention germany ’ s technological capabilities and its drive for perfection and precision , as , for instance , in the car industry . the struggle against stereotypes is a hard one .
many young britons still believe that germans are not open-minded and – even worse – without any sense of humor .
but according to the study , the overall rating of germans among young britons is slowly but surely improving .
or , as one of those polled put it : “ the krauts are okay ! ” hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de examining germany 's image abroad discipline , industriousness and a good education are the characteristics most americans and russians associate with germans , according to a new survey commissioned by deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2004 historians split on german wwi role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand set events in motion aug .
1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .

over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .

article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .

other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .
buissoniere added that the us 's blurring the boundaries between aid workers and military personnel was " endangering the lives of humanitarian workers and jeopardizing aid to people in need . "
killed by the taliban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters claimed responsibility for the killings of five msf workers in june .
the organization also accused the afghan government of failing to conduct a proper investigation into the murder of the aid workers , who were ambushed in their clearly marked vehicle on a rural road near badghis in the northwestern part of the country .
all five - three europeans and two afghans - were shot dead , and taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility .
police initially arrested around a dozen people , but all were later released .
the islamic fundamentalist taliban , which was forced from power during the us-led war in 2001 , has said that it regards aid workers as legitimate targets .
more than 20 have been killed in afghanistan this year alone .
and on wednesday , msf said the country had become far too dangerous for its workers .
msf officials also stated that the context in which humanitarian organizations have to work in the country is making it almost impossible to provide aid to the afghan people .
much of the south and eastern parts of afghanistan are effectively off-limits , and the northern region is quickly becoming a no-go zone , too .
only the capital , kabul , which is guarded by international troops , is relatively secure .
msf ’ s withdrawal represents a serious blow to the afghan government , which is heavily reliant on foreign organizations to provide humanitarian assistance .
it also highlights the worsening security situation in the run-up to the presidential elections scheduled for this october .
us ' regrets ' pullout the united states said wednesday that it " regretted " the decision and asked the aid organization to reconsider its move .
however , the state department also rejected msf 's claim that washington was using humanitarian aid to further political or military goals . "
we 've never conditioned our aid on cooperation with military operations , " state department deputy spokesman adam ereli told reporters .
" we strongly reject any allegation that our actions have made it more dangerous for humanitarian workers to assist the people of afghanistan . "
nevertheless , us officials still asked the group to stay on in afghanistan .
" they are doing important and invaluable work there , " ereli said .
a domino effect ?
the organization has been working in afghanistan for 24 years , and the nobel prize-winning ngo has 80 foreign and 1,400 afghan staff in the country .
many operations were suspended immediately after the attack in june .
its decision to pull out is likely to have a domino effect , prompting other aid organizations to reconsider their involvement there .
since may , the organization has repeatedly claimed that humanitarian aid was being " co-opted " by the us military .
msf officials have said that they were extremely concerned about leaflets being distributed by coalition forces .
these included a picture of an afghan girl carrying a bag of wheat , and linked the continued provision of humanitarian aid with the local population ’ s willingness to pass on information relating to the taliban , al qaida , and other militant groups .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .
buissoniere added that the us 's blurring the boundaries between aid workers and military personnel was " endangering the lives of humanitarian workers and jeopardizing aid to people in need . "
killed by the taliban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters claimed responsibility for the killings of five msf workers in june .
the organization also accused the afghan government of failing to conduct a proper investigation into the murder of the aid workers , who were ambushed in their clearly marked vehicle on a rural road near badghis in the northwestern part of the country .
all five - three europeans and two afghans - were shot dead , and taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility .
police initially arrested around a dozen people , but all were later released .
the islamic fundamentalist taliban , which was forced from power during the us-led war in 2001 , has said that it regards aid workers as legitimate targets .
more than 20 have been killed in afghanistan this year alone .
and on wednesday , msf said the country had become far too dangerous for its workers .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .
washington accuses tehran of using its civilian atomic energy program to mask development of nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to take up the issue and possibly impose sanctions .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "

though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .
" i hope the same thing will happen as with the -lrb- russian -rrb- mir space station , " said feustel-büechl .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .

dieter hundt , president of the bda federation , told the financial times that deals done by daimlerchrysler , siemens and bosch to increase working hours without extra pay must be copied by other employers if germany is to thrive .
last week , daimlerchrysler announced it would protect 6,000 jobs in baden-württemberg in exchange for concessions on working practices , including an increase from 35 to 39 hours a week for services staff .
only a few weeks earlier , siemens used similar tactics to persuade staff at two sites in north rhine-westphalia to work 40 hours a week instead of 35 to avoid their jobs being relocated to hungary .

their fate has confronted the german public with the reality of an illness that most people would prefer to ignore , even though the number of sufferers of the most common form of dementia , alzheimer , is growing rapidly . there are now over a million sufferers in germany , with an additional two hundred thousand every year .
in the race to find preventive medicines and perhaps even a cure , international experts are now meeting in philadelphia .
in germany , meanwhile , many alzheimer patients end their lives in nursing homes , with widely differing standards of care . not enough time for patients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald juhnke in 1997 harald juhnke , whose alcoholism made his career a roller coaster of disasters and recoveries so frequent he seemed indestructible , now lives in a nursing home , mostly unaware of his surroundings . he 's treated just like any other patient with no special privileges . that means his day is a lot like elke schmidt -lrb- name changed -rrb- , who was n't washed properly this morning .

the last tv pictures from her birthday in may show a little old lady in a wheelchair smiling uncertainly , not understanding what 's going on or why she 's being presented with flowers by people who , to her , are strangers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alzheimer patients often suffer from loss of human contact .
in most nursing homes , there is little sign of the human contact that is so important for alzheimer patients ; a friendly word , an embrace , the assurance that " it does n't matter " if something is spilled or knocked over , someone to go for a walk with . too few staff , too little time - that 's why mrs. schmidt is often back in bed at 8 p.m. , although she may not be at all tired - but there 's always a sleeping pill to help . taking a different approach in the state-run home for the elderly and infirm in riehl , a suburb of cologne , carrying for alzheimer patients is going to change .
there 'll be a cafe open until late at night for those who are still wide awake .
there are different forms of accommodation - ranging from minimum supervision for mild cases to round-the clock care - and regular staff training to keep up with the latest medical advances . " the center is important because , as a result of demographic development , there are more and more elderly dementia sufferers , but there are n't enough suitable places for them , " said otto ludorff , who directs the center . other european countries have already gone further . holland , for example , has for years been able to offer a better quality of care more tailored to the needs of individual dementia sufferers .
why has it taken so long in germany ? " it 's a social problem , " ludorff said .
" here in germany we do n't seem to have realized that more should be done for dementia patients .
i think we need to focus more on the question : what value does an elderly person have in our society ? up to now that 's been largely ignored . " often it 's lack of money that causes healthcare plans to fail . caring for dementia patients is a round-the-clock task and requires a staff with time on their hands . although the riehl team will not be getting any extra funds or staff for their new center , motivation is high . but it would n't be possible without the 200 voluntary helpers , every one of whom will be needed changing societal attitudes hans-joachim schirmer is an expert on alzheimer and works as a doctor at the riehl center . once a week people with relatives suffering from the disease - many of them at their wits ' end - can consult him for free to find out what care possibilities are available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens in the netherlands enjoy some of the best nursing care in europe .
there may not be any sign of a cure in sight but schirmer is optimistic " that it is possible to help people suffering from this terrible illness , so that their families do n't lie awake at night wondering how to cope .
that we can do , with the means now at our disposal . " but if the situation is really to change for the better , for sufferers and their families many of whom try to keep their relatives out of a nursing home for as long as possible , often exhausting themselves with the double burden of caring for their parents while also carrying on with their own job or taking care of children , then society as a whole has to rethink its approach to the elderly and how important it is to help them and their families prepare for death with dignity . susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a multicultural home for the elderly forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .

" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .
" i hope the same thing will happen as with the -lrb- russian -rrb- mir space station , " said feustel-büechl .
" mir was designed for a life of seven years but was used for 15 . " daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's great space race with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ?
-lrb- july 11 , 2004 -rrb- esa and the eu in the past year , the european union drafted its first space policy and even cemented space as an eu competency in the draft constitution .
its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams .
-lrb- july 11 , 2004 -rrb- europe creates its own space vehicle the european space agency designed its automated transfer vehicle to handle the logistics of the international space station .
once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- the second coming of columbus europe 's columbus research module will help scientists learn about the effects of space travel on humans and more .
the findings could aid preparations for the first manned mars voyage .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is iss a waste of money or a good example of international cooperation in science ?

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.07.2004 nato seeks consensus on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants nato to help train iraqi police nato ambassadors have so far failed to reach a consensus on the training of iraqi security forces .
with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .
they maintain he is reluctant to endorse any element of bush 's iraq policy which could help him into a second term in the presidential elections later this year . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .

" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .

the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .

" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .

" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .

other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .

other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .

for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2004 germany worried by iran 's nuclear activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani wants to negotiate .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .
washington accuses tehran of using its civilian atomic energy program to mask development of nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to take up the issue and possibly impose sanctions .
europe has been working closely with iran to persuade it to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors and to allay western doubts in order to prevent an escalation of the crisis .
the three countries have met with opposition from us officials for refusing to refer tehran to the un . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. nuclear watchdog set to rebuke iran europe 's big three and the u.s. have finally achieved a compromise on iran 's nuclear program .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "

this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .
they maintain he is reluctant to endorse any element of bush 's iraq policy which could help him into a second term in the presidential elections later this year . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

the survey , conducted among people aged between 16 and 25 , investigates to what extent outmoded , stereotypical thought is still current among the younger generations in both lands . the study aims to provide insights into the perceptions and attitudes of germans towards the uk and vice versa .
those polled were young people from the two countries , who were of particular interest for both the cultural institutions involved in the project . germans think uk is modern and multi-cultural the study shows that of all the young germans polled , over 50 percent have visited the uk .
a whopping 97 percent have at least a basic knowledge of the english language .
britain is only second to the usa when it comes to being the most popular country for studies abroad .
all in all , young germans view the uk as a successful multi-cultural society which is modern and future-oriented . britain is also considered to be a country where important trends are set , for instance in the art and music scenes .
it ’ s not perceived as a country committed to the ideals of the european union .
on the other hand , only 37 percent of the young britons polled have been to germany . brit kids think " krauts " are not trendy germany is not really a country they tend to think of in terms of studying there .
it ’ s not seen to be trendy , but most young britons mention germany ’ s technological capabilities and its drive for perfection and precision , as , for instance , in the car industry . the struggle against stereotypes is a hard one .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .
they maintain he is reluctant to endorse any element of bush 's iraq policy which could help him into a second term in the presidential elections later this year . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

the center of attention will shift further up the north coast of germany to bremerhaven at the beginning of august where a further six days of meetings between delegates will take place . the 28th scientific committee for antarctic research -lrb- scar -rrb- meeting is the biggest of its kind in the world and acts as a forum for research bodies to promote their future projects and proposals for international collaboration on climate change and other environmental issues . on the opening day , edelgard bulmahn , germany 's minister of science , announced that the german government would finance the € 26 million construction of the new neumayer iii polar station in the antarctic .
such an investment would secure germany 's position at the pinnacle of international polar research . in terms of climatology , antarctica is of the utmost importance as it is seen as the measuring instrument for global environmental change .
scientists call it the " iced up key to the earth . "
the sea and seasonal changes around antarctica control many aspects of the planet 's climate . antarctica plays a huge climatic role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of ice shelves like the larsen b is a concern to polar experts .
the strong flow of the circumpolar current from west to east around antarctica connects the pacific , indian and atlantic ocean basins and their currents .
the resulting global circulation redistributes heat and other properties , influencing patterns of temperature and rainfall . another major influence on the earth 's climate comes from the extent and thickness of sea-ice around antarctica .
its formation is the largest single seasonal phenomenon on earth , doubling the size of antarctica each year .
as well as reflecting the sun 's heat , this annual ice formation injects salt into the ocean , making the water denser and causing it to flow downwards aiding those currents in neighboring oceans which dictate climates around the earth . the ice itself holds many keys to the future of the planet .
core samples taken from antarctica have shown the ages of the earth and have given scientists possible glimpses into the future of the planet . global warming hampering climate regulation global warming , however , has begun to affect antarctica 's ability to regulate the planet 's climate .
while the formation of sea-ice continues year-on-year , larger sections of ice shelves are collapsing during warmer spells , reducing the land mass that is increased annually .
it is feared that such reductions have already begun to reduce antarctica 's influence on weather and tidal systems . the majority of discussions during " science week " will focus on new ways of reading the information antarctica compiles on the state of the world 's climate , the current state of the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic and ways to stop and reverse the damaging trends that are slowly beginning to hamper the icy continent 's work in regulating the planet 's weather . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de digging for answers to climate change eu scientists working on the research project promess1 have dug deep into the earth below the mediterranean in the hope that the pre-historic sediment cores they 've collected will offer new insight into climate change .

with its contributions to the international space station , europe is participating in the biggest joint international project ever undertaken .
the iss could also have major implications for its own space ambitions . critics have dismissed the iss as a " trailer park in the sky , " and politicians have bickered over its soaring price tag .
but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .

but the space station has been a major diplomatic coup for europe , russia , the united states and the rest of their international partners .
despite differences over the war in iraq and , before that , the bombing of yugoslavia , work contined on the space station unabated .
never before have astronauts , engineers , scientists and politicians from so many countries worked together on such an enormous and peaceful undertaking .
with the launch next year of its automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- and the columbus research module a year later , europe will dramatically increase its participation in the space project .
" we are presently at a very decisive stage in europe because we are about to finalize our major contributions to the space station , " jörg feustel-büechl , director of human spaceflight for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- will enable esa to transport payloads to iss .
it makes its maiden voyage in sept .
2004 .
europe is a major partner in the iss program , with belgium , denmark , france , germany , italy , the netherlands , norway , spain , sweden and switzerland together contributing about € 8 billion of the project 's estimated € 100 billion cost .
columbus and the atv -lrb- illustration -rrb- , which will shuttle supplies to the iss and ferry rubbish away from it , form the core of europe 's iss contributions .
the space station also serves as the basis of europe 's manned spaceflight program - since it 's christening in 2000 , esa has sent seven astronauts to the iss .
old technology paves way for new diplomacy the space station has had its share of problems .
critics have lambasted the outmoded technology on the iss .
" the international space station is yesterday 's technology , " robert park , a physicist at the unviersity of maryland told congress recently .
" another 10 years of urine assays on a space station is not going to tell us much we do n't already know . "
but proponants note that the station marks an important chapter in post-cold war history and scientists still have a lot they can learn from it .
" the space station is the largest endeavor ever undertaken by the united states , europe , russia , japan and canada , " said günther brandt , head of space station elements at eads space transportation in bremen .
" such a large project was never undertaken before .
by working together , we will be able to do even bigger things in the future .
from a scientific perspective , it will be a unique facility that could be open to the participation of all the scientists of the world . "
questions about the future in recent months , however , that uptopian scientific vision has been imperiled .
after the tragic disintegration of the space shuttle columbia in 2003 , the iss ' future fell into a state of limbo because most major iss components are launched by the shuttles , including esa 's columbus . the accident forced the united states to rethink its manned space strategy - a period of deliberation that left the fate of the space station uncertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia forced the us government to rethink its manned spaceflight program but in january , us president george w. bush unveiled his plan to send american astronauts back to the moon and on to mars , at the same time saying that once its airworthiness had been reproven , shuttle flights would resume in order to complete construction of the iss by 2010 and the fleet would be retired right after .
the way forward " bush 's plan stabilizes our program , " said feustel-büechl .
" it provides a clear , step-by-step strategy starting with the space station as a first step , then a return to the moon and further exploration of the solar system .
in this strategy , the iss is an essential first building block because you ca n't go to mars if you have n't experienced the systems you need . "
the new technologies needed for travel to mars , like living quarters for extreme environments or new propulsion systems could all be tested on the station , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columbus laboratory - cutaway view an artist 's impression of columbus - cutaway view - the european laboratory on the international space station. credit : esa construction of the iss , which is already the size of a football field and only halfway complete , is expected to resume in earnest when the remaining shuttle fleet starts flying again in 2005 .
life after the space shuttle after the space shuttle fleet is mothballed , the iss partners have agreed to use the smaller russian soyuz system to transport astronauts to the station .
but each soyuz capsule can only carry three astronauts into space .
an extra soyuz must also be docked on the iss for escape in the event of an emergency . another possibility is nasa 's planned " crew exploration vehicle . "
though still just a sketch on paper , the craft is intended to be ready by 2014 .
a combination of the two could handle iss transportation needs .
meanwhile , a steady stream of european atv 's , russian " progress " cargo vessels and japan 's forthcoming h-ii transfer vehicle could deliver equipment and fuel , keep iss ' inhabitants clothed and fed and also haul away their trash .
even without the shuttle , the iss could still continue its operations as planned through 2016 .
but at the european space agency , officials are even more optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2004 historians split on german wwi role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand set events in motion aug .
1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers operation valkyrie , the plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view .

the decision comes after the murder of five of its aid workers in the country on june 2 , for which taliban militants claimed responsibility .
the group has also accused united states-led forces in afghanistan of using humanitarian aid for military and political motives .
" the us-backed coalition has constantly sought to use humanitarian assistance to build support for its military and political ambitions and msf denounces this attempt to coopt humanitarian aid , " said marine buissoniere , the organization 's secretary general .
buissoniere added that the us 's blurring the boundaries between aid workers and military personnel was " endangering the lives of humanitarian workers and jeopardizing aid to people in need . "
killed by the taliban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters claimed responsibility for the killings of five msf workers in june .
the organization also accused the afghan government of failing to conduct a proper investigation into the murder of the aid workers , who were ambushed in their clearly marked vehicle on a rural road near badghis in the northwestern part of the country .
all five - three europeans and two afghans - were shot dead , and taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility .
police initially arrested around a dozen people , but all were later released .
the islamic fundamentalist taliban , which was forced from power during the us-led war in 2001 , has said that it regards aid workers as legitimate targets .
more than 20 have been killed in afghanistan this year alone .
and on wednesday , msf said the country had become far too dangerous for its workers .
msf officials also stated that the context in which humanitarian organizations have to work in the country is making it almost impossible to provide aid to the afghan people .
much of the south and eastern parts of afghanistan are effectively off-limits , and the northern region is quickly becoming a no-go zone , too .
only the capital , kabul , which is guarded by international troops , is relatively secure .
msf ’ s withdrawal represents a serious blow to the afghan government , which is heavily reliant on foreign organizations to provide humanitarian assistance .
it also highlights the worsening security situation in the run-up to the presidential elections scheduled for this october .
us ' regrets ' pullout the united states said wednesday that it " regretted " the decision and asked the aid organization to reconsider its move .
however , the state department also rejected msf 's claim that washington was using humanitarian aid to further political or military goals . "
we 've never conditioned our aid on cooperation with military operations , " state department deputy spokesman adam ereli told reporters .
" we strongly reject any allegation that our actions have made it more dangerous for humanitarian workers to assist the people of afghanistan . "
nevertheless , us officials still asked the group to stay on in afghanistan .
" they are doing important and invaluable work there , " ereli said .
a domino effect ?
the organization has been working in afghanistan for 24 years , and the nobel prize-winning ngo has 80 foreign and 1,400 afghan staff in the country .
many operations were suspended immediately after the attack in june .
its decision to pull out is likely to have a domino effect , prompting other aid organizations to reconsider their involvement there .
since may , the organization has repeatedly claimed that humanitarian aid was being " co-opted " by the us military .
msf officials have said that they were extremely concerned about leaflets being distributed by coalition forces .
these included a picture of an afghan girl carrying a bag of wheat , and linked the continued provision of humanitarian aid with the local population ’ s willingness to pass on information relating to the taliban , al qaida , and other militant groups .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .
washington accuses tehran of using its civilian atomic energy program to mask development of nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to take up the issue and possibly impose sanctions .
europe has been working closely with iran to persuade it to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors and to allay western doubts in order to prevent an escalation of the crisis .

ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .
washington accuses tehran of using its civilian atomic energy program to mask development of nuclear weapons and wants the un security council to take up the issue and possibly impose sanctions .
europe has been working closely with iran to persuade it to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors and to allay western doubts in order to prevent an escalation of the crisis .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2004 germany worried by iran 's nuclear activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani wants to negotiate .
foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .

foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity . expressing " great concern " over reports that iran had flouted the international community 's warnings and was once again building centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium , fischer on wednesday cautioned the country against making a " miscalculation . "
under a landmark deal brokered in october with europe 's " big three " of britain , france and germany , iran agreed to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment programs , stop making centrifuges , allow tougher inspections and file a complete declaration of its nuclear activities since then , experts from the united nation 's nuclear watchdog have discovered omissions in iran 's reporting on its atomic energy program , inspection visits have been delayed and the government has backed away from a pledge to stop all enrichment-related efforts - a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power plants or weapons .
questionable activity several weeks ago the agreement unraveled even further , when tehran broke seals placed on enrichment equipment by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and threatened to resume the manufacture and assembly of centrifuges , diplomats said tuesday .
another intelligence report being circulated by diplomats this week alleges that iranian officials were caught negotiating with a russian company over the procurement of a substance that can boost nuclear explosions in atomic weapons .
iran has denied that it is developing nuclear arms , and has said that its nuclear program is solely intended for peaceful purposes .
at the same time , officials in tehran accuse britain , france and germany of reneging on last year 's deal by pushing for a tough new un resolution which rebukes the country for failing to cooperate with the iaea .
the door is still open " the news reaching us from the iaea gives cause for great concern over whether the leadership in iran ... is not making a miscalculation , " fischer said wednesday in an interview with private german news channel n-tv .
the foreign minister said iran should understand that the current action is " not the right path to go down " and that it is in the interest of " peace and stability in the region to continue on the path , through the door that we opened . "
" i do not want to give up hope , " he added .
ahead of a meeting scheduled for thursday in paris between the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france and iranian officials , fischer stressed that the europeans " have held exactly to what we agreed . "
a french foreign ministry spokeswoman said french , german and british officials were ready to negotiate with tehran .
" it is in this context that discussions continue with the iranian authorities , with a view to providing all guarantees on the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " she said .
late last month , iran 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said his country should continue talks with the european trio over its nuclear program .
averting a crisis while the iaea has found many instances where iran concealed potentially weapons-related activities , the un organization says it has no clear evidence that tehran is trying to build a bomb .
the united states says there is sufficient proof and has accused the international agency of acting too cautiously .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .

with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday . the ambassadors emerged from wednesday 's talks without results , but armed with a determination to find a compromise . " it 's not over , there will be another meeting tomorrow morning , " one official told the reuters news agency .
" there is a debate and there is no consensus yet , " he said . how quickly a deal can be reached , is largely dependent upon france , which some officials have accused of trying to stall the training operation , which nato hopes to launch in iraq with an advance party next month . when diplomats meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- summit in turkey last month agreed to provide training for iraqi security forces both france and germany expressed their opposition to staging the operation inside iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has been a thorn in the white house 's side on the eve of the june summit , french president jacques chirac -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed his view that any training done with iraqi security forces should be done bilaterally by individual countries and not under the alliance 's flag .
chirac has also vehemently opposed the establishment of any nato representation in baghdad .
" any nato footprint on iraqi soil would be unwise , " he said .
french officials have said that sending nato to iraq could entangle french soldiers in the conflict or , worse , undermine the new iraqi government 's credibility and sovereignty .
at the time , german chancellor gerhard schröder supported that position , reiterating his view that no bundeswehr troops would be sent to iraq .
" we are of course willing to participate in the training of iraqi troops if the iraqi government wants that , " he said .
" but this has to take place in training centers in germany because we stick to our position that no german troops will be sent to iraq . "
bad memories resurface though berlin has since said it would not stand in the way of a consensus , it has refused to allow bundeswehr soldiers to set foot on iraqi soil .
and paris still is n't budging .
" france 's position has not changed , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman in paris said wednesday , according to reuters .
this view has once again put paris at loggerheads with washington , where a major nato mission in iraq could help boost the image of president george w. bush , who has been widely criticized abroad for his unilateralist moves in the lead up to the iraq war and the roller coaster diplomacy that followed the invasion and occupation .
though france and the united states have sought to smooth over transatlantic tensions over the iraq war in recent months , chirac has remained particularly adamant about the nato issue .
critics of the french president suggest his tough stance on the issue of training iraqi security forces is a further attempt to restrict u.s. influence .
they maintain he is reluctant to endorse any element of bush 's iraq policy which could help him into a second term in the presidential elections later this year . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

collectors in new york and london these days are eagerly snatching up works by young german artists . neo rauch can hardly keep up with the demand .
top collectors face waiting lists of over a year to get their hands on one of the eastern german artist 's melancholic interpretations of socialist themes .
the 43-year-old rauch has already achieved superstar status in the art world .
his paintings are going at auctions for well over $ 100,000 .
but a new generation of young artists has emerged in his footsteps to help make " kraut art " take the world by storm , much as kraut rock hit the music world in the 1970s .
martin eder , tim eitel , jonathan meese or daniel richter are just a few of the thirtysomethings who have become extremely popular in the international art scene .
these young german artists - or " yga " - are being marketed as a pendant to their provocative british counterparts , such as damien hirst or tracey emin , who took the art market by storm in the 1990s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gérard goodrow took over as director of the art cologne in 2003 but the yga are doing something completely different .
according to gérard goodrow -lrb- photo -rrb- , director of the prestigious art cologne trade fair , their work marks a continuation of an art tradition .
" since the mid-1960s , especially german painting has been leading the market , " he told dw-world .
" we saw this already in the late 1960s and early 1970s with artists like gerhard richter and sigmar polke , who have remained on the top . "
a figurative and understandable medium the fascination for german paintings in particular has very pragmatic reasons .
as christian nagel , a well-known cologne gallery owner , put it : " it ’ s figurative and understandable . "
goodrow explains that when these new stars emerge on the scene , collectors are drawn to their paintings .
" that ’ s something that especially an american audience needs , this attractiveness , " goodrow said .
" americans - and i hate to say this being an american myself - tend to be superficial in their assessment of painting and the german painters have that beauty within their work . "
but , he added , the pieces are also highly conceptual .
" there is a lot of content you can dig into . "
perhaps it is n't just this tradition , which explains the success of contemporary german art , though . although talent plays a role , most of these artists are also trained painters .
" there are a lot of really interesting artists in the academies here in germany .
the education of the artists , especially when it comes to painting , is very sophisticated , " said sven ahrens , one of the owners of the cologne gallery hammelehle and ahrens .
" these young students get a lot of knowledge and ideas in their studies and then they start to paint their ideas because it ’ s easy , it ’ s quick , and you can immediately have a result . "
eastern nostalgia and the market loves these results .
collectors are especially interested in artists from the leipzig school in eastern germany , like forerunner neo rauch .
they often pick up on socialist themes , painting them with a touch of nostalgic realism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , " weiche " , 1999 " in the leipzig school especially , there are a lot of works dealing with the politics of east and west germany and the struggle of the young artists trying to create a profile for themselves within this east-west dichotomy , " said art cologne 's goodrow .
western germany is , of course , still much richer and internationally more popular than the former east .
" leipzig isn ’ t necessarily a place where foreigners go , " he said .
" and now they are going there , to see these artists . "
the paintings also express a form of romantic idyll , which meets the needs of collectors , said gallery owner nagel .
" what ’ s hard or maybe disturbing and hurting is ' out ' right now , " he said .
" people only want to see affirmative aspects . "
the art scene also tends to blossom in depressed times , added ahrens .
" we are living in difficult times in germany at the moment .
a lot is changing in society and we are facing a lot of cutbacks .
these are times that art and especially painting starts to get a really lively and sometimes romantic moment . "
yga a farce ?
the strong popularity of yga also poses a danger , though , especially when it 's accompanied by high prices .
" the problem with situations like this is that an artist can be crushed under the hype , " said goodrow .
" if you ’ re producing works for a waiting list , and not just making works of art , then you start producing for the market . "
what 's more , if a collector is on a waiting list for over a year , an artist faces expectations of producing something that people anticipated two years ago .
" it ’ s difficult to get the artistic development really going , " said goodrow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim berresheim and jonathan meese , " tea and coffee 1 " , 2004 that 's why an artist like jonathan meese shrugs off the whole phenomena of new german art . he says he has always done his art the way he wants to and always will .
" it 's a farce , " he said .
" i do n't care about it and i 'm not affected by it .
so it ca n't destroy me either , because it does n't affect me .
other artists who bet on this development and believe that it 's interesting and important can be destroyed . "
something to be proud of as with other trends in the art scene , only time will tell whether yga will prove to be just another hyped up fad .
" there 's nothing really special about it , " said meese .
" basically it just shows that something out of a particular country is presentable worldwide .
i think it 's just a wave that comes and goes again . "
but , as goodrow points out , germany also has nothing to be ashamed of .
it is leading the market both in terms of young art , as well as artists of the middle and older generation , such as gerhard richter , he said .
" i know it ’ s always very difficult for germans to be proud of something because of their past , but this is something they can be very proud of , " he say .
" when you consider how many of the top hundred artists worldwide are actually german , it shows that we ’ re doing something right here .

1 marks the 90th anniversary of kaiser wilhelm ii 's declaration of war against russia .
but the role of imperial germany in unleashing the horrors of world war i continues to divide historians nearly a century later . nine decades down the line , the question that still plagues scholars is how " civilized " europe could plunge itself into one of the most atrocious conflicts in the course of humanity .
article 231 of the treaty of versailles that ended the great war put the sole responsibility for its outbreak firmly with germany and its allies , largely due to decisions made during the so-called july crisis of 1914 .
on july 5 of that year , german kaiser wilhelm ii gave his blessing when an austro-hungarian envoy asked him to back reprisals against serbia after the heir to the hapsburg throne , franz ferdinand , was assassinated in sarajevo the week before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of italy , great britain , france and the united states try to set up the peace treaty of world war i. the " blank check " for vienna 's actions that fateful summer is considered by historians to be the decisive first step on the march to war .
other german sins included its refusal to join last-ditch crisis talks proposed by london and later , its invasion of neutral belgium - decisions that appeared to set off an inexorable chain reaction .
over-simplification ?
in that age of alliances , the sword-rattling by central europe 's monarchies served as a provocation to the designated protector of the slavs - russia - and its wake , france and britain , united in their " entente cordiale " . but although history has traditionally placed the bulk of the blame on germany , some scholars such as oxford professor hew strachan call such analyses simplistic . " the complexity of events makes it impossible to attribute fault to one country in particular , " strachan was quoted by der spiegel news weekly as saying .
" the entente overestimated the decision-making process in germany , " which was itself reacting to the action of others , strachan said .
he noted that the russian decision for a partial mobilization of troops on july 24 " was perceived by germany as a declaration of war " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian troops launch an attack on the italian-austrian front in 1915 .
on july 31 , berlin asked saint petersburg to hold off on its mobilization , and a day later , it deployed its own troops , followed by france .
in 1914 , all of europe was on guard .
the system of alliances split the continent down the middle with germany , austria-hungary and italy on one side versus britain , france and russia on the other .
colonial ambitions , hegemonic delusions and an accelerating arms race fed the tensions that had already brought europe to the brink of war three times since 1905 .
for decades , germany looked to this explosive backdrop to deny its own responsibility in the war .
it took historian fritz fischer in the 1960s to point out the unflattering image in the mirror .
fischer accused germany of unleashing a preventative war to break the country 's prevailing isolationism .
britain and russia 's military force made berlin fear a shift in the balance of power toward the entente . the scholar cited in particular the meeting of a german war council on december 8 , 1912 during which the option of a preventative war against russia was floated .
21st century theories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcare propagandizing the ' adventure ' of world war i after creating a scandal with his analysis , fischer was later seen as having opened the door to germany 's recognition of its central role in instigating the bloody conflict .
but today , the pendulum has swung back slightly due to the work of modern historians who draw attention to the contradictions in fischer 's theories .
for example , why did german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg - presented as the architect of the war by fischer - send a message to vienna on july 29 ordering it to " stop at belgrade " with its military action ?
and why did wilhelm ii go on a pleasure cruise in july if a major war was being plotted ?
" there were immediate and profound causes of the war , the mobilization of millions of soldiers ... that were the result of decisions and orders formulated by men ... from the small circles around the monarchies of vienna and berlin ... and to a lesser extent , london , paris and saint petersburg , " wrote german historian volker berghahn . afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany remembers plot to kill hitler tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .

britons are unsure of the costs of climate change but barely half of more than 1,000 people polled thought they themselves would feel any significant impact .
and almost half of those interviewed thought changing their behaviour would make no difference to climate change .
most were willing to take some action , though nearly two out of three rejected paying more for petrol .
a total of 1,007 british adults were questioned between 16 and 18 july by icm for the climate change special being broadcast on bbc news 24 and bbc one .
climate change came last of the list of important issues facing the uk , chosen by 53 % , though 64 % said it was one of the most important problems facing the world .
personal behaviour more than half -lrb- 60 % -rrb- said global warming would best be tackled at a global level , with 5 % wanting europe to set the pace , and 9 % thinking individual households were best placed to act .
full poll results -lrb- 38k -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
download the reader here asked whether changes in personal behaviour would make a difference , 54 % said yes and 44 % no .
despite that , 85 % said they would be prepared to make changes , with only 13 % dissenting .
the changes people were prepared to make included recycling more household waste -lrb- 96 % -rrb- , using less energy at home -lrb- 92 % -rrb- , using cars less -lrb- 68 % -rrb- , and taking fewer flights -lrb- 62 % -rrb- .
but only 51 % said they would be prepared to pay more to fly , and just 37 % would agree to pay more for petrol .
most respondents claimed some familiarity with the subject : 23 % said they knew a lot about climate change and 58 % a little .
a total of 90 % thought the uk would feel some impact , with 47 % expecting " a lot " of effects , and 43 % " a little " .
extreme weather was seen as the likeliest impact -lrb- 80 % -rrb- , with 68 % saying the country would become wetter , 62 % hotter - and 36 % colder .
only 18 % of respondents said it was too early to say whether human or natural causes were more to blame for climate change - 64 % said human activities were more culpable .
of those , 67 % blamed road and air transport , 66 % the felling of trees , and 57 % power generation from coal and oil .
yet despite the levels of knowledge and concern that the questioning revealed , 43 % of respondents said they expected climate change to have not very much effect on them personally , with 9 % saying it would have no effect at all .
perhaps this goes some way to explain the frustration of those convinced that climate change is a huge threat .
until we believe it will make a difference to us and to our children , we are unlikely to take it seriously enough to do anything very much about it .
on this showing , more than half of us still expect it will leave us largely unscathed .
so it remains a problem for someone else to worry about .

britons are unsure of the costs of climate change but barely half of more than 1,000 people polled thought they themselves would feel any significant impact .
and almost half of those interviewed thought changing their behaviour would make no difference to climate change .
most were willing to take some action , though nearly two out of three rejected paying more for petrol .
a total of 1,007 british adults were questioned between 16 and 18 july by icm for the climate change special being broadcast on bbc news 24 and bbc one .
climate change came last of the list of important issues facing the uk , chosen by 53 % , though 64 % said it was one of the most important problems facing the world .
personal behaviour more than half -lrb- 60 % -rrb- said global warming would best be tackled at a global level , with 5 % wanting europe to set the pace , and 9 % thinking individual households were best placed to act .
full poll results -lrb- 38k -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
download the reader here asked whether changes in personal behaviour would make a difference , 54 % said yes and 44 % no .
despite that , 85 % said they would be prepared to make changes , with only 13 % dissenting .
the changes people were prepared to make included recycling more household waste -lrb- 96 % -rrb- , using less energy at home -lrb- 92 % -rrb- , using cars less -lrb- 68 % -rrb- , and taking fewer flights -lrb- 62 % -rrb- .
but only 51 % said they would be prepared to pay more to fly , and just 37 % would agree to pay more for petrol .
most respondents claimed some familiarity with the subject : 23 % said they knew a lot about climate change and 58 % a little .
a total of 90 % thought the uk would feel some impact , with 47 % expecting " a lot " of effects , and 43 % " a little " .
extreme weather was seen as the likeliest impact -lrb- 80 % -rrb- , with 68 % saying the country would become wetter , 62 % hotter - and 36 % colder .
only 18 % of respondents said it was too early to say whether human or natural causes were more to blame for climate change - 64 % said human activities were more culpable .
of those , 67 % blamed road and air transport , 66 % the felling of trees , and 57 % power generation from coal and oil .
yet despite the levels of knowledge and concern that the questioning revealed , 43 % of respondents said they expected climate change to have not very much effect on them personally , with 9 % saying it would have no effect at all .
perhaps this goes some way to explain the frustration of those convinced that climate change is a huge threat .
until we believe it will make a difference to us and to our children , we are unlikely to take it seriously enough to do anything very much about it .
on this showing , more than half of us still expect it will leave us largely unscathed .
so it remains a problem for someone else to worry about .
