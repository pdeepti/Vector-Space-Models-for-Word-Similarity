leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .

" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "

called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

conductor christian thielemann announced on tuesday he was stepping down over a dispute about funding .
thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .
but after a meeting with berlin 's top cultural official , thomas flierl , who offered the conductor only half of what he demanded , thielemann said he was leaving .
the german capital has been faced with an acute problem of arts funding since reunification , which brought together cultural venues formerly on two sides of the berlin wall .
the city 's ability to support its three opera houses has been seriously in doubt , especially since municiple debt totals some € 47 billion -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
it is unclear when exactly thielemann will leave deutsche oper ; no replacement has yet been named . more briefs 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism 14.05.2004 -pipe- berlin love parade cancelled 14.05.2004 -pipe- german citizens in debt 14.05.2004 -pipe- tempelhof air traffic grounded for good 13.05.2004 -pipe- günter grass reads for st. pauli 13.05.2004 -pipe- fewer politically motivated crimes committed in germany 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2004 girl power rules in german media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke engelke is all the talk as her late-night chat show makes its debut as comedian anke engelke launches her first late-night talk show , she joins the swelling ranks of german television 's fast-talking , high-earning women . when germany 's first lady of comedy , anke engelke , premiered her new late-night talk show on monday , the nation 's eyes were on her .
some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .
between christiansen 's grilling of condoleezza rice on sunday evening and engelke 's chatting to sting one day later , their male colleagues are barely getting a word in . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .

critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .

he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .
between christiansen 's grilling of condoleezza rice on sunday evening and engelke 's chatting to sting one day later , their male colleagues are barely getting a word in . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes .
-lrb- december 13 , 2003 -rrb- media in the news back to the media dossier feedback germany 's leading talk shows are firmly in female hands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dresden - a city risen from the ashes stone by stone looking beyond the facade dealing with a rising disaster questioning the reasons for allied air war business -pipe- 18.05.2004 silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's new amd factory got $ 545 million in state subsidies u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .
it 's another coup for the eastern german city that has become one of the region 's few economic bright spots . dresden 's new chip factory , to be named fab 36 , is california-based advanced micro devices ' second plant in this city of baroque splendor and is expected to create some 1,000 jobs over the next three years .
amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .
the factory will manufacture the 300-millimeter silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips , turning out around 13,000 wafers per month when operations begin . fab 36 is amd 's second plant in this city on the river elbe .
the first , fab 30 , another wafer-production facility , went into operation in 2000 and produced 5,000 wafers a week . chancellor gerhard schröder , who attended the groundbreaking ceremony on sunday , said the amd investment - one of the biggest in eastern germany in a decade - highlighted dresden as " the leading location for semiconductor manufacturing in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of infineon 's 300-mm wafers several other chipmakers , such as infineon and zmd have also set up shop in dresden , and given rise to the region 's moniker , " silicon saxony . " a bright spot in the east dresden 's success is made all the more striking compared to most of the rest of the former east germany , which is caught in a downward spiral of economic malaise . the region , which became a part of the federal republic of germany in 1990 , was imbued with a heady sense of optimism in the years just after reunification .
but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .
school enrollment is declining , apartment blocks in many towns stand empty , waiting not for some expected upturn , but for the wrecking ball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction site of a chip factory in the eastern german city of frankfurt / oder .
construction stopped after the 1.3 billion euro project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , pulled out .
other eastern regions have taken stabs at high-profile , high-tech projects , but several have turned into high-profile failures .
a custom chip factory that was tauted as a rejuvenator for the suffering economy in the eastern state of brandenburg declared bankruptcy late last year . dresden , however , has bucked the trend , partly thanks to its history under communism .
in east germany , the city was already a center of high-tech , since the university of dresden was the country 's leading technology school .
saxony was also the center of microelectronic production , employing some 30,000 people before the berlin wall fell .
the technology and manufacturing facilities might have been behind the west , but the skills were top notch .
the city has benefited from that base , which has acted as a magnet for companies in need of highly skilled labor . government role the state and federal governments have also played a key role in attractving companies to the region with a wide range of subsidies and incentives . for the new amd chip factory , the state of saxony invested $ 200 million .
the pot was sweetened further with the $ 540 million infusion from the federal government , part of its " eastern reconstruction " funding program .
a banking consortium headed by dresdner bank came forward with another $ 700 million in guaranteed loans from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hector ruiz , chairman of the board and ceo of amd hertor ruiz , chief executive of amd -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the $ 540 million in subsidies and loans were a " significant consideration " in deciding to come to dresden . in remarks that went against prevailing current opinion in germany , ruiz praised the country as a business location .
while many business leaders and economists bemoan the nation 's business environment , complaining of high taxes and labor costs that drive companies to set up shop abroad , ruiz said concerns over foreign investment had been " politicized . " " i 'm puzzled why people see germany so negatively , " he told reporters .
" it is certainly not the place to build a tennis show factory , but in high-tech there are many factors in its favor . "
those included , he added , well-trained personnel , high-quality research facilities and a good infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dresden - a city risen from the ashes stone by stone looking beyond the facade dealing with a rising disaster questioning the reasons for allied air war business -pipe- 18.05.2004 silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's new amd factory got $ 545 million in state subsidies u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .
it 's another coup for the eastern german city that has become one of the region 's few economic bright spots . dresden 's new chip factory , to be named fab 36 , is california-based advanced micro devices ' second plant in this city of baroque splendor and is expected to create some 1,000 jobs over the next three years .
amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .
the factory will manufacture the 300-millimeter silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips , turning out around 13,000 wafers per month when operations begin . fab 36 is amd 's second plant in this city on the river elbe .
the first , fab 30 , another wafer-production facility , went into operation in 2000 and produced 5,000 wafers a week . chancellor gerhard schröder , who attended the groundbreaking ceremony on sunday , said the amd investment - one of the biggest in eastern germany in a decade - highlighted dresden as " the leading location for semiconductor manufacturing in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of infineon 's 300-mm wafers several other chipmakers , such as infineon and zmd have also set up shop in dresden , and given rise to the region 's moniker , " silicon saxony . " a bright spot in the east dresden 's success is made all the more striking compared to most of the rest of the former east germany , which is caught in a downward spiral of economic malaise . the region , which became a part of the federal republic of germany in 1990 , was imbued with a heady sense of optimism in the years just after reunification .
but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .
school enrollment is declining , apartment blocks in many towns stand empty , waiting not for some expected upturn , but for the wrecking ball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction site of a chip factory in the eastern german city of frankfurt / oder .
construction stopped after the 1.3 billion euro project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , pulled out .
other eastern regions have taken stabs at high-profile , high-tech projects , but several have turned into high-profile failures .
a custom chip factory that was tauted as a rejuvenator for the suffering economy in the eastern state of brandenburg declared bankruptcy late last year . dresden , however , has bucked the trend , partly thanks to its history under communism .
in east germany , the city was already a center of high-tech , since the university of dresden was the country 's leading technology school .
saxony was also the center of microelectronic production , employing some 30,000 people before the berlin wall fell .
the technology and manufacturing facilities might have been behind the west , but the skills were top notch .
the city has benefited from that base , which has acted as a magnet for companies in need of highly skilled labor . government role the state and federal governments have also played a key role in attractving companies to the region with a wide range of subsidies and incentives . for the new amd chip factory , the state of saxony invested $ 200 million .
the pot was sweetened further with the $ 540 million infusion from the federal government , part of its " eastern reconstruction " funding program .
a banking consortium headed by dresdner bank came forward with another $ 700 million in guaranteed loans from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hector ruiz , chairman of the board and ceo of amd hertor ruiz , chief executive of amd -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the $ 540 million in subsidies and loans were a " significant consideration " in deciding to come to dresden . in remarks that went against prevailing current opinion in germany , ruiz praised the country as a business location .
while many business leaders and economists bemoan the nation 's business environment , complaining of high taxes and labor costs that drive companies to set up shop abroad , ruiz said concerns over foreign investment had been " politicized . " " i 'm puzzled why people see germany so negatively , " he told reporters .
" it is certainly not the place to build a tennis show factory , but in high-tech there are many factors in its favor . "
those included , he added , well-trained personnel , high-quality research facilities and a good infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .

german model nadja auermann has weighed in on the issue of national pride , telling a magazine she regrets the fact that germans lack any sense of patriotism whatsoever . she might be understandably proud of her incredibly long legs , which at 44 inches -lrb- 111.8 cm -rrb- have gotten her in the guinness book of world records , but nadja auermann said as a german , she 's made to feel she should n't be proud of her country . " i 've lived abroad for 12 years and seen that actually every country has patriotism - except germany " the 32-year-old auermann told stern magazine .
in the interview , the supermodel addressed the subject of patriotism in her native country , which is almost a taboo subject because of the horrors committed by the nazi regime . " the darkness of our history can not be forgotten , " she said , but added that today 's germans should not feel like they have to apologize whenever they are abroad and say they are german .
she herself is tired of apologizing for nazi crimes committed 60 years ago . " i wish my generation could be allowed to stand up and show a little more self-confidence , " she said . the 5 ' 11 " -lrb- 180 cm -rrb- berlin native , whose modelling success came after she dyed her hair platinum blonde , said that today 's generations should n't be burdened forever .
a little patriotism , she said , could do germany good .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : energy for the future windy energy in the sea flying with solar energy the power of the desert sun turning plants into fuel living planet -pipe- 18.05.2004 utilizing the earth ’ s heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geothermal energy harnesses the heat from inside the earth to create warmth .
in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

among the measures agreed on by the social democrats and greens is the closure by 2008 of the walsum coal mine near duisburg . there were plans to mine under the river rhine there .
in addition , coal subsidies will no longer be paid every month , but retroactively at the beginning of the following year . according to the government , this measure alone will save € 360 million euros of federal funds from 2006 to 2012 .
potential savings in the medium term could be even greater as the rising price of coal will be taken into account when calculating payments .
in november of last year , chancellor gerhard schröder promised the coal industry total subsidies of € 16 billion until 2012 .
the greens had initially demanded an end to coal subsidies by 2010 .
the governments of saarland and north rhine-westphalia still have to decide on how much they will support the coal industry in their states .
the situation in north rhine-westphalia echoes that on the federal level , with the state 's greens pushing for a faster end to coal subsidies . dw-world.de the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past call it the unromantic road .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .

but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

among the measures agreed on by the social democrats and greens is the closure by 2008 of the walsum coal mine near duisburg . there were plans to mine under the river rhine there .
in addition , coal subsidies will no longer be paid every month , but retroactively at the beginning of the following year . according to the government , this measure alone will save € 360 million euros of federal funds from 2006 to 2012 .
potential savings in the medium term could be even greater as the rising price of coal will be taken into account when calculating payments .
in november of last year , chancellor gerhard schröder promised the coal industry total subsidies of € 16 billion until 2012 .
the greens had initially demanded an end to coal subsidies by 2010 .
the governments of saarland and north rhine-westphalia still have to decide on how much they will support the coal industry in their states .
the situation in north rhine-westphalia echoes that on the federal level , with the state 's greens pushing for a faster end to coal subsidies . dw-world.de the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past call it the unromantic road .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point .

" we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .

" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .
in 1993 , berlin competed to host the 2000 games , but they went instead to sydney . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : from books to bach " leipzig is coming ! " : that 's the new slogan adopted by the city in a move to regain its historic status as an intellectual and cultural hub .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2004 girl power rules in german media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke engelke is all the talk as her late-night chat show makes its debut as comedian anke engelke launches her first late-night talk show , she joins the swelling ranks of german television 's fast-talking , high-earning women . when germany 's first lady of comedy , anke engelke , premiered her new late-night talk show on monday , the nation 's eyes were on her .
some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .

police said the man slapped the german leader with his open hand .
a government spokesman , thomas steg , said schröder had been signing autographs for new members of the spd when the incident occurred .
the man , who wore the same armband as other new party members , was arrested and taken in for questioning by police .
no details about possible motives were made available although schröder 's spd has fallen dramatically in opinion polls after unpopular cuts in the country 's welfare system .
a 21-year-old guest at the reception said schröder " really got it full on . "
the german leader , however , emerged from the incident uninjured and continued to participate in the event . more briefs 18.05.2004 -pipe- german prosecutors say algerian terror leader captured 18.05.2004 -pipe- bayern munich 's coach gets the ax 18.05.2004 -pipe- deutsche oper director quits over money 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism 14.05.2004 -pipe- berlin love parade cancelled 14.05.2004 -pipe- german citizens in debt radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2004 german intelligence says islamists present major threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police conduct a raid on a mosque in bochum in april , 2004 .
germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

" you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

german model nadja auermann has weighed in on the issue of national pride , telling a magazine she regrets the fact that germans lack any sense of patriotism whatsoever . she might be understandably proud of her incredibly long legs , which at 44 inches -lrb- 111.8 cm -rrb- have gotten her in the guinness book of world records , but nadja auermann said as a german , she 's made to feel she should n't be proud of her country . " i 've lived abroad for 12 years and seen that actually every country has patriotism - except germany " the 32-year-old auermann told stern magazine .
in the interview , the supermodel addressed the subject of patriotism in her native country , which is almost a taboo subject because of the horrors committed by the nazi regime . " the darkness of our history can not be forgotten , " she said , but added that today 's germans should not feel like they have to apologize whenever they are abroad and say they are german .
she herself is tired of apologizing for nazi crimes committed 60 years ago . " i wish my generation could be allowed to stand up and show a little more self-confidence , " she said . the 5 ' 11 " -lrb- 180 cm -rrb- berlin native , whose modelling success came after she dyed her hair platinum blonde , said that today 's generations should n't be burdened forever .
a little patriotism , she said , could do germany good .

it 's another coup for the eastern german city that has become one of the region 's few economic bright spots . dresden 's new chip factory , to be named fab 36 , is california-based advanced micro devices ' second plant in this city of baroque splendor and is expected to create some 1,000 jobs over the next three years .
amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .
the factory will manufacture the 300-millimeter silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips , turning out around 13,000 wafers per month when operations begin . fab 36 is amd 's second plant in this city on the river elbe .
the first , fab 30 , another wafer-production facility , went into operation in 2000 and produced 5,000 wafers a week . chancellor gerhard schröder , who attended the groundbreaking ceremony on sunday , said the amd investment - one of the biggest in eastern germany in a decade - highlighted dresden as " the leading location for semiconductor manufacturing in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of infineon 's 300-mm wafers several other chipmakers , such as infineon and zmd have also set up shop in dresden , and given rise to the region 's moniker , " silicon saxony . " a bright spot in the east dresden 's success is made all the more striking compared to most of the rest of the former east germany , which is caught in a downward spiral of economic malaise . the region , which became a part of the federal republic of germany in 1990 , was imbued with a heady sense of optimism in the years just after reunification .
but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .
school enrollment is declining , apartment blocks in many towns stand empty , waiting not for some expected upturn , but for the wrecking ball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction site of a chip factory in the eastern german city of frankfurt / oder .
construction stopped after the 1.3 billion euro project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , pulled out .
other eastern regions have taken stabs at high-profile , high-tech projects , but several have turned into high-profile failures .
a custom chip factory that was tauted as a rejuvenator for the suffering economy in the eastern state of brandenburg declared bankruptcy late last year . dresden , however , has bucked the trend , partly thanks to its history under communism .
in east germany , the city was already a center of high-tech , since the university of dresden was the country 's leading technology school .
saxony was also the center of microelectronic production , employing some 30,000 people before the berlin wall fell .
the technology and manufacturing facilities might have been behind the west , but the skills were top notch .
the city has benefited from that base , which has acted as a magnet for companies in need of highly skilled labor . government role the state and federal governments have also played a key role in attractving companies to the region with a wide range of subsidies and incentives . for the new amd chip factory , the state of saxony invested $ 200 million .
the pot was sweetened further with the $ 540 million infusion from the federal government , part of its " eastern reconstruction " funding program .
a banking consortium headed by dresdner bank came forward with another $ 700 million in guaranteed loans from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hector ruiz , chairman of the board and ceo of amd hertor ruiz , chief executive of amd -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the $ 540 million in subsidies and loans were a " significant consideration " in deciding to come to dresden . in remarks that went against prevailing current opinion in germany , ruiz praised the country as a business location .
while many business leaders and economists bemoan the nation 's business environment , complaining of high taxes and labor costs that drive companies to set up shop abroad , ruiz said concerns over foreign investment had been " politicized . " " i 'm puzzled why people see germany so negatively , " he told reporters .
" it is certainly not the place to build a tennis show factory , but in high-tech there are many factors in its favor . "
those included , he added , well-trained personnel , high-quality research facilities and a good infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .

the zew center for european economic research , based in mannheim , said its index of institutional investor and analyst sentiment fell from 49.7 to 46.4 in april .
analysts surveyed by bloomberg had expected a fall , but only to 49 .
the numbers have cast doubt on the strength of germany 's recovery , which has been based almost entirely on exports .
on monday , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said the economy was showing no signs of a " self-sustaining " recovery since rising unemployment and uncertainty about the future are causing people to save rather than spend .
the german economy grew by 0.4 percent during the first quarter .
while that was the fastest in three years , it was driven entirely by demand from abroad , according to government figures . more briefs 18.05.2004 -pipe- karl lagerfeld heads down market 17.05.2004 -pipe- thyssenkrupp to acquire germany 's biggest shipbuilder 17.05.2004 -pipe- first dax float in almost two years 17.05.2004 -pipe- siemens plans to double sales to china 14.05.2004 -pipe- france and germany to coordinate industrial decisions 14.05.2004 -pipe- tui expands its internet offerings 14.05.2004 -pipe- higher fuel prices mean germans pumping less 13.05.2004 -pipe- german economy grows due to exports radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .
between christiansen 's grilling of condoleezza rice on sunday evening and engelke 's chatting to sting one day later , their male colleagues are barely getting a word in . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .
skinhead music fuelled by the internet is " the number one gateway drug " for many young people , the minister said , adding that anti-semitism was the distinguishing mark of the scene . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign extremist population shrinking in germany the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2004 leipzig 's olympic dream ends in disappointment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopeful crowds gathered in leipzig were disappointed by the news .
leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .

he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .
in 1993 , berlin competed to host the 2000 games , but they went instead to sydney . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : from books to bach " leipzig is coming !

washington sees it as essential in fighting terrorism ; the european parliament has condemned the agreement . the european commission , with the support of eu member states , gave its approval on monday , saying the agreement , which stipulates airlines give american authorities 34 items of information about passengers en route to the u.s. , provides " adequate protection " under eu privacy laws . the information includes credit card and e-mail information , phone numbers and meal preferences , which the u.s. hopes will enable it to identify potential terrorists . " a negotiated solution is never perfect , " frits bolkestein , the eu 's internal market commission , told reporters . " especially when you are up against laws adopted by the u.s. congress in the understandable conviction that it is vital to protect the u.s. against terrorism . " he added : " we have come up with an adequate solution , which the member states have supported . " the gathering of passenger data was one of a raft of measures the u.s. adopted in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 as part of its war against terror .
while several european airlines , including germany 's lufthansa , have already been providing passenger information , in doing so they were in legal limbo and possibly in violation of eu data protection laws . according to bolkestein , monday 's agreement ends any such confusion .
having no agreement , he said , would mean " chaos for eu passengers and airlines . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has been negotiating with the u.s. since last year over the data transfer question .
the commission said both sides compromised in the final agreement , with the u.s. receiving fewer pieces of data than authorities originally wanted ; the information is kept for a shorter period of time ; and the data " are to be used for limited purposes , " it said . harsh criticism the deal has come under intense fire by data protection groups and the european parliament .
last month , the eu 's legislative body voted to launch legal action against the accord , saying they will take the case to europe 's highest court . " governments displayed their contempt for the rule of law in the eu today by adopting an agreement which privacy watchdogs and meps have said contravenes european law , " johanna boogerd-quaak , a dutch member of the european parliament , told reporters on monday . some meps had pushed for the number of items to be reduced to 19 from 34 and wanted the emphasis to be on information that would help law enforcement officials , rather than such things as meal preferences . " one way or the other , this issue will end up before the european court of justice , " boogerd-quaak said . green mep patricia mckenna said the agreement failed to provide adequate safeguards that u.s. authorities would not pass data on to other agencies or to foreign governments . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. security looks for a home away from home the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .

at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .

francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .

the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .

conductor christian thielemann announced on tuesday he was stepping down over a dispute about funding .
thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .
but after a meeting with berlin 's top cultural official , thomas flierl , who offered the conductor only half of what he demanded , thielemann said he was leaving .
the german capital has been faced with an acute problem of arts funding since reunification , which brought together cultural venues formerly on two sides of the berlin wall .
the city 's ability to support its three opera houses has been seriously in doubt , especially since municiple debt totals some € 47 billion -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
it is unclear when exactly thielemann will leave deutsche oper ; no replacement has yet been named . more briefs 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism 14.05.2004 -pipe- berlin love parade cancelled 14.05.2004 -pipe- german citizens in debt 14.05.2004 -pipe- tempelhof air traffic grounded for good 13.05.2004 -pipe- günter grass reads for st. pauli 13.05.2004 -pipe- fewer politically motivated crimes committed in germany 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response .

the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .

respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .

conductor christian thielemann announced on tuesday he was stepping down over a dispute about funding .
thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .

the german capital has been faced with an acute problem of arts funding since reunification , which brought together cultural venues formerly on two sides of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2004 girl power rules in german media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke engelke is all the talk as her late-night chat show makes its debut as comedian anke engelke launches her first late-night talk show , she joins the swelling ranks of german television 's fast-talking , high-earning women . when germany 's first lady of comedy , anke engelke , premiered her new late-night talk show on monday , the nation 's eyes were on her .
some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .

conductor christian thielemann announced on tuesday he was stepping down over a dispute about funding .
thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .
but after a meeting with berlin 's top cultural official , thomas flierl , who offered the conductor only half of what he demanded , thielemann said he was leaving .
the german capital has been faced with an acute problem of arts funding since reunification , which brought together cultural venues formerly on two sides of the berlin wall .
the city 's ability to support its three opera houses has been seriously in doubt , especially since municiple debt totals some € 47 billion -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
it is unclear when exactly thielemann will leave deutsche oper ; no replacement has yet been named . more briefs 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism 14.05.2004 -pipe- berlin love parade cancelled 14.05.2004 -pipe- german citizens in debt 14.05.2004 -pipe- tempelhof air traffic grounded for good 13.05.2004 -pipe- günter grass reads for st. pauli 13.05.2004 -pipe- fewer politically motivated crimes committed in germany 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .
in 1993 , berlin competed to host the 2000 games , but they went instead to sydney . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : from books to bach " leipzig is coming !

" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .
in 1993 , berlin competed to host the 2000 games , but they went instead to sydney . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : from books to bach " leipzig is coming ! " : that 's the new slogan adopted by the city in a move to regain its historic status as an intellectual and cultural hub .

22 , 2003 -rrb- leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

washington sees it as essential in fighting terrorism ; the european parliament has condemned the agreement . the european commission , with the support of eu member states , gave its approval on monday , saying the agreement , which stipulates airlines give american authorities 34 items of information about passengers en route to the u.s. , provides " adequate protection " under eu privacy laws . the information includes credit card and e-mail information , phone numbers and meal preferences , which the u.s. hopes will enable it to identify potential terrorists . " a negotiated solution is never perfect , " frits bolkestein , the eu 's internal market commission , told reporters . " especially when you are up against laws adopted by the u.s. congress in the understandable conviction that it is vital to protect the u.s. against terrorism . " he added : " we have come up with an adequate solution , which the member states have supported . " the gathering of passenger data was one of a raft of measures the u.s. adopted in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 as part of its war against terror .
while several european airlines , including germany 's lufthansa , have already been providing passenger information , in doing so they were in legal limbo and possibly in violation of eu data protection laws . according to bolkestein , monday 's agreement ends any such confusion .
having no agreement , he said , would mean " chaos for eu passengers and airlines . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has been negotiating with the u.s. since last year over the data transfer question .
the commission said both sides compromised in the final agreement , with the u.s. receiving fewer pieces of data than authorities originally wanted ; the information is kept for a shorter period of time ; and the data " are to be used for limited purposes , " it said . harsh criticism the deal has come under intense fire by data protection groups and the european parliament .
last month , the eu 's legislative body voted to launch legal action against the accord , saying they will take the case to europe 's highest court . " governments displayed their contempt for the rule of law in the eu today by adopting an agreement which privacy watchdogs and meps have said contravenes european law , " johanna boogerd-quaak , a dutch member of the european parliament , told reporters on monday . some meps had pushed for the number of items to be reduced to 19 from 34 and wanted the emphasis to be on information that would help law enforcement officials , rather than such things as meal preferences . " one way or the other , this issue will end up before the european court of justice , " boogerd-quaak said . green mep patricia mckenna said the agreement failed to provide adequate safeguards that u.s. authorities would not pass data on to other agencies or to foreign governments . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. security looks for a home away from home the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition .

it 's another coup for the eastern german city that has become one of the region 's few economic bright spots . dresden 's new chip factory , to be named fab 36 , is california-based advanced micro devices ' second plant in this city of baroque splendor and is expected to create some 1,000 jobs over the next three years .
amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .
the factory will manufacture the 300-millimeter silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips , turning out around 13,000 wafers per month when operations begin . fab 36 is amd 's second plant in this city on the river elbe .
the first , fab 30 , another wafer-production facility , went into operation in 2000 and produced 5,000 wafers a week . chancellor gerhard schröder , who attended the groundbreaking ceremony on sunday , said the amd investment - one of the biggest in eastern germany in a decade - highlighted dresden as " the leading location for semiconductor manufacturing in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of infineon 's 300-mm wafers several other chipmakers , such as infineon and zmd have also set up shop in dresden , and given rise to the region 's moniker , " silicon saxony . " a bright spot in the east dresden 's success is made all the more striking compared to most of the rest of the former east germany , which is caught in a downward spiral of economic malaise . the region , which became a part of the federal republic of germany in 1990 , was imbued with a heady sense of optimism in the years just after reunification .
but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .
school enrollment is declining , apartment blocks in many towns stand empty , waiting not for some expected upturn , but for the wrecking ball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction site of a chip factory in the eastern german city of frankfurt / oder .
construction stopped after the 1.3 billion euro project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , pulled out .
other eastern regions have taken stabs at high-profile , high-tech projects , but several have turned into high-profile failures .
a custom chip factory that was tauted as a rejuvenator for the suffering economy in the eastern state of brandenburg declared bankruptcy late last year . dresden , however , has bucked the trend , partly thanks to its history under communism .
in east germany , the city was already a center of high-tech , since the university of dresden was the country 's leading technology school .
saxony was also the center of microelectronic production , employing some 30,000 people before the berlin wall fell .
the technology and manufacturing facilities might have been behind the west , but the skills were top notch .
the city has benefited from that base , which has acted as a magnet for companies in need of highly skilled labor . government role the state and federal governments have also played a key role in attractving companies to the region with a wide range of subsidies and incentives . for the new amd chip factory , the state of saxony invested $ 200 million .
the pot was sweetened further with the $ 540 million infusion from the federal government , part of its " eastern reconstruction " funding program .
a banking consortium headed by dresdner bank came forward with another $ 700 million in guaranteed loans from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hector ruiz , chairman of the board and ceo of amd hertor ruiz , chief executive of amd -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the $ 540 million in subsidies and loans were a " significant consideration " in deciding to come to dresden . in remarks that went against prevailing current opinion in germany , ruiz praised the country as a business location .
while many business leaders and economists bemoan the nation 's business environment , complaining of high taxes and labor costs that drive companies to set up shop abroad , ruiz said concerns over foreign investment had been " politicized . " " i 'm puzzled why people see germany so negatively , " he told reporters .
" it is certainly not the place to build a tennis show factory , but in high-tech there are many factors in its favor . "
those included , he added , well-trained personnel , high-quality research facilities and a good infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .
between christiansen 's grilling of condoleezza rice on sunday evening and engelke 's chatting to sting one day later , their male colleagues are barely getting a word in . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .

thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .
but after a meeting with berlin 's top cultural official , thomas flierl , who offered the conductor only half of what he demanded , thielemann said he was leaving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2004 last chance to catch aging nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for simon wiesenthal to catch the last nazis the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center is making a last ditch effort to track down nazis before they die of old age .
already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .
between christiansen 's grilling of condoleezza rice on sunday evening and engelke 's chatting to sting one day later , their male colleagues are barely getting a word in . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .
and this would offer an environmentally friendly alternative to nuclear power . genevieve oger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2004 last chance to catch aging nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for simon wiesenthal to catch the last nazis the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center is making a last ditch effort to track down nazis before they die of old age .
already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

germany 's domestic intelligence service warns in its annual report that islamic extremists and foreign terror groups pose the greatest danger to the country 's security . germany 's office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , one of three national intelligence services in germany that is charged with gathering information on domestic as well as foreign extremist and terror groups active on home soil , stressed on monday that islamic terrorism posed the biggest security threat in germany . presenting the annual domestic security report 2003 in berlin , german interior minister otto schily said , " unfortunately we still face diverse dangers in germany of which islamic terrorism and islamic extremism form the focal point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .

as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .

he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .

he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .

the city 's ability to support its three opera houses has been seriously in doubt , especially since municiple debt totals some € 47 billion -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .

critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .

" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2004 last chance to catch aging nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for simon wiesenthal to catch the last nazis the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center is making a last ditch effort to track down nazis before they die of old age .
already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .
the factory will manufacture the 300-millimeter silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips , turning out around 13,000 wafers per month when operations begin . fab 36 is amd 's second plant in this city on the river elbe .
the first , fab 30 , another wafer-production facility , went into operation in 2000 and produced 5,000 wafers a week . chancellor gerhard schröder , who attended the groundbreaking ceremony on sunday , said the amd investment - one of the biggest in eastern germany in a decade - highlighted dresden as " the leading location for semiconductor manufacturing in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of infineon 's 300-mm wafers several other chipmakers , such as infineon and zmd have also set up shop in dresden , and given rise to the region 's moniker , " silicon saxony . " a bright spot in the east dresden 's success is made all the more striking compared to most of the rest of the former east germany , which is caught in a downward spiral of economic malaise . the region , which became a part of the federal republic of germany in 1990 , was imbued with a heady sense of optimism in the years just after reunification .
but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .
school enrollment is declining , apartment blocks in many towns stand empty , waiting not for some expected upturn , but for the wrecking ball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction site of a chip factory in the eastern german city of frankfurt / oder .
construction stopped after the 1.3 billion euro project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , pulled out .
other eastern regions have taken stabs at high-profile , high-tech projects , but several have turned into high-profile failures .
a custom chip factory that was tauted as a rejuvenator for the suffering economy in the eastern state of brandenburg declared bankruptcy late last year . dresden , however , has bucked the trend , partly thanks to its history under communism .
in east germany , the city was already a center of high-tech , since the university of dresden was the country 's leading technology school .
saxony was also the center of microelectronic production , employing some 30,000 people before the berlin wall fell .
the technology and manufacturing facilities might have been behind the west , but the skills were top notch .
the city has benefited from that base , which has acted as a magnet for companies in need of highly skilled labor . government role the state and federal governments have also played a key role in attractving companies to the region with a wide range of subsidies and incentives . for the new amd chip factory , the state of saxony invested $ 200 million .
the pot was sweetened further with the $ 540 million infusion from the federal government , part of its " eastern reconstruction " funding program .
a banking consortium headed by dresdner bank came forward with another $ 700 million in guaranteed loans from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hector ruiz , chairman of the board and ceo of amd hertor ruiz , chief executive of amd -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the $ 540 million in subsidies and loans were a " significant consideration " in deciding to come to dresden . in remarks that went against prevailing current opinion in germany , ruiz praised the country as a business location .
while many business leaders and economists bemoan the nation 's business environment , complaining of high taxes and labor costs that drive companies to set up shop abroad , ruiz said concerns over foreign investment had been " politicized . " " i 'm puzzled why people see germany so negatively , " he told reporters .
" it is certainly not the place to build a tennis show factory , but in high-tech there are many factors in its favor . "
those included , he added , well-trained personnel , high-quality research facilities and a good infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2004 last chance to catch aging nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for simon wiesenthal to catch the last nazis the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center is making a last ditch effort to track down nazis before they die of old age .
already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .

conductor christian thielemann announced on tuesday he was stepping down over a dispute about funding .
thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .
but after a meeting with berlin 's top cultural official , thomas flierl , who offered the conductor only half of what he demanded , thielemann said he was leaving .
the german capital has been faced with an acute problem of arts funding since reunification , which brought together cultural venues formerly on two sides of the berlin wall .
the city 's ability to support its three opera houses has been seriously in doubt , especially since municiple debt totals some € 47 billion -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
it is unclear when exactly thielemann will leave deutsche oper ; no replacement has yet been named . more briefs 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism 14.05.2004 -pipe- berlin love parade cancelled 14.05.2004 -pipe- german citizens in debt 14.05.2004 -pipe- tempelhof air traffic grounded for good 13.05.2004 -pipe- günter grass reads for st. pauli 13.05.2004 -pipe- fewer politically motivated crimes committed in germany 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

washington sees it as essential in fighting terrorism ; the european parliament has condemned the agreement . the european commission , with the support of eu member states , gave its approval on monday , saying the agreement , which stipulates airlines give american authorities 34 items of information about passengers en route to the u.s. , provides " adequate protection " under eu privacy laws . the information includes credit card and e-mail information , phone numbers and meal preferences , which the u.s. hopes will enable it to identify potential terrorists . " a negotiated solution is never perfect , " frits bolkestein , the eu 's internal market commission , told reporters . " especially when you are up against laws adopted by the u.s. congress in the understandable conviction that it is vital to protect the u.s. against terrorism . " he added : " we have come up with an adequate solution , which the member states have supported . " the gathering of passenger data was one of a raft of measures the u.s. adopted in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 as part of its war against terror .
while several european airlines , including germany 's lufthansa , have already been providing passenger information , in doing so they were in legal limbo and possibly in violation of eu data protection laws . according to bolkestein , monday 's agreement ends any such confusion .
having no agreement , he said , would mean " chaos for eu passengers and airlines . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has been negotiating with the u.s. since last year over the data transfer question .
the commission said both sides compromised in the final agreement , with the u.s. receiving fewer pieces of data than authorities originally wanted ; the information is kept for a shorter period of time ; and the data " are to be used for limited purposes , " it said . harsh criticism the deal has come under intense fire by data protection groups and the european parliament .
last month , the eu 's legislative body voted to launch legal action against the accord , saying they will take the case to europe 's highest court . " governments displayed their contempt for the rule of law in the eu today by adopting an agreement which privacy watchdogs and meps have said contravenes european law , " johanna boogerd-quaak , a dutch member of the european parliament , told reporters on monday . some meps had pushed for the number of items to be reduced to 19 from 34 and wanted the emphasis to be on information that would help law enforcement officials , rather than such things as meal preferences . " one way or the other , this issue will end up before the european court of justice , " boogerd-quaak said . green mep patricia mckenna said the agreement failed to provide adequate safeguards that u.s. authorities would not pass data on to other agencies or to foreign governments . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. security looks for a home away from home the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition .

washington sees it as essential in fighting terrorism ; the european parliament has condemned the agreement . the european commission , with the support of eu member states , gave its approval on monday , saying the agreement , which stipulates airlines give american authorities 34 items of information about passengers en route to the u.s. , provides " adequate protection " under eu privacy laws . the information includes credit card and e-mail information , phone numbers and meal preferences , which the u.s. hopes will enable it to identify potential terrorists . " a negotiated solution is never perfect , " frits bolkestein , the eu 's internal market commission , told reporters . " especially when you are up against laws adopted by the u.s. congress in the understandable conviction that it is vital to protect the u.s. against terrorism . " he added : " we have come up with an adequate solution , which the member states have supported . " the gathering of passenger data was one of a raft of measures the u.s. adopted in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 as part of its war against terror .
while several european airlines , including germany 's lufthansa , have already been providing passenger information , in doing so they were in legal limbo and possibly in violation of eu data protection laws . according to bolkestein , monday 's agreement ends any such confusion .
having no agreement , he said , would mean " chaos for eu passengers and airlines . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has been negotiating with the u.s. since last year over the data transfer question .
the commission said both sides compromised in the final agreement , with the u.s. receiving fewer pieces of data than authorities originally wanted ; the information is kept for a shorter period of time ; and the data " are to be used for limited purposes , " it said . harsh criticism the deal has come under intense fire by data protection groups and the european parliament .
last month , the eu 's legislative body voted to launch legal action against the accord , saying they will take the case to europe 's highest court . " governments displayed their contempt for the rule of law in the eu today by adopting an agreement which privacy watchdogs and meps have said contravenes european law , " johanna boogerd-quaak , a dutch member of the european parliament , told reporters on monday . some meps had pushed for the number of items to be reduced to 19 from 34 and wanted the emphasis to be on information that would help law enforcement officials , rather than such things as meal preferences . " one way or the other , this issue will end up before the european court of justice , " boogerd-quaak said . green mep patricia mckenna said the agreement failed to provide adequate safeguards that u.s. authorities would not pass data on to other agencies or to foreign governments . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. security looks for a home away from home the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .

the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

in france , renewable energies generate less than one percent of the country ’ s power .
yet a lesser-known form , called geothermal energy , is being successfully used near paris . chevilly-larue seems like your average parisian suburb .
but it is actually home to europe 's largest geothermal energy facility .
at the earth ’ s center , around 3,700 miles below the surface , temperatures can reach up to 5,000 degrees .
this heat is transferred to nearby water , which travels back up to the surface through faults and cracks .
the geothermal plant of chevilly-larue , nestled between a school and a residential area , pumps the hot water up to its turbines .
it then uses the warmth that is still in the water to heat the homes and businesses linked up to its system .
geothermal energy is a somewhat noisy endeavor .
but it is a clean and renewable source of heat and hot water .
according to thermal engineer michel andres , who runs the facility , this form of energy involves simply transferring water from one place to another .
" so , we avoid any fossil fuel combustion and any polluting gases or emissions , which means you do n't contribute to the greenhouse effect , " andres explains .
useful energy , but with shortcomings it 's estimated that the presence of this geothermal facility reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40,000 tons every year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 tons .
plants like this one are most effective in an urban context , in places with a high population density .
the further away the final destination , the more expensive the power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cyclists riding past a nuclear-powered station outside saint-vulbas could breathe in clean air if more geothermal power was used in france .
francis sorin , information director for the french society for nuclear energy , says geothermal energy is useful , but has its shortcomings .
“ this kind of power is sometimes difficult to extract , so it costs a lot , ” sorin says .
a further problem is that it can not provide large amounts of electricity , he adds .
“ it can fulfill local needs , but obviously not national ones . ”
a costly undertaking geothermal energy does require a lot of investment .
the construction of the water extraction plant and the water distribution network is the most expensive .
once that is completed , extracting the heat costs very little .
therefore , to make the facility economically viable , you have to have many customers in a small area .
with nearly 18,000 homes or offices linked up to its network , the facility in chevilly-larue has been able to develop such economies of scale .
but that is n't always the case .
the operators of this clean energy are now seeking political support .
this geothermal facility and others in the region are lobbying to get the french government to reduce the value added tax on geothermal power .
currently , the tax stands at about 20 percent .
the state electricity company , which sells mostly nuclear power , enjoys a 5.5 percent tax rate .
geothermal activists argue that a lower tax rate would provide an incentive to get more geothermal units off the ground .

some three million people tuned in to see the successful stand-up comedian crack jokes and chat with international celebrities . attracting the attention of 27 percent of the key viewers between the ages of 14 and 49 , anke 's late night started as the most successful talk show in the late night spot . in the coming weeks , there will be a lot of resting on the slight shoulders of the 38-year-old host .
as the successor to harald schmidt , germany 's beloved king of comedy , the debut of her new show is a media milestone .
every episode of anke late night is set to cost private broadcaster sat 1 € 90,000 , while the star herself will be taking home a tidy € 20,000 per night . with this much at stake , the knives are inevitably out .
critics and viewers alike wo n't be generous when it comes to assessing her performance .
as far as her employers are concerned , engelke 's main purpose is to boost ratings and bring in advertisers .
sat 1 is expecting a slow start , with a 30-second commercial in the show 's ad breaks costing € 9,500 , slightly less than they did during the glory days of schmidt 's reign , when some 1.8 million viewers watched the harald schmidt show every night , four times a week . passing the schmidt mantle viewers , meanwhile , are eager to see if she can do justice to the format her predecessor single-handedly made cool to the german tv public , brought up on a diet of cheesy chat shows fronted by non-threatening , mainstream hosts along the lines of rudi carrell and thomas gottschalk .
jay leno they were n't - and it was n't until schmidt came along in 1995 that viewers began tuning in regularly for a late-night dose of topical humor and smooth gags . when schmidt quit last december , it unleashed a media frenzy , and all sorts of celebrities were mooted as likely candidates for the vacated position .
amid the flurry of publicity triggered when anke engelke was announced as his successor , the one thing nobody mentioned was the fact she was a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unthinkable ten years ago , the prospect of a woman behind the traditional late-night show desk was the least interesting aspect of engelke 's appointment .
it may be a new departure , but sat 1 head roger schawinski is confident he knows what 's he 's doing .
he has said he hopes anke late night will appeal to a different , more broad-based audience - younger , less intellectual , more " female . " the female touch and these days , that 's definitely not a dirty word in german tv .
right now , it seems like germany ca n't get enough of shows fronted by women , whether they 're stand-up comedians or hard-hitting political commentators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybrit illner und sabine christiansen -lrb- r -rrb- were awarded the german television prize in 2002 for hosting the debate between chancellor schröder and edmund schröder during the last elections .
respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .
between christiansen 's grilling of condoleezza rice on sunday evening and engelke 's chatting to sting one day later , their male colleagues are barely getting a word in . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

respected journalists such as sabine christiansen , sandra maischberger , maybrit illner , elke heidenreich , anne will and marietta slomka have become household names in recent years , chairing the country 's most popular talk shows and anchoring its daily newscasts . dr. lutz erbring from berlin 's free university downplays the trend .
" the best person gets the job , " he says .
" these categories have become redundant , and it 's no longer relevant to talk in terms of gender roles . "
he stresses that the talk show is primarily personality driven , arguing that the current predominance of women is arbitrary , and the balance may well tip again in years to come . a role reversal erbring describes the german media as pretty much " unisex " for the last decade , and says that in this respect , it reflects the rest of europe .
he also points out a recent role reversal , with men tending to host the lightweight shows - such as stefan raab and the hugely popular tv total - while women have taken the helm of the meatier interview format . sabine christiansen 's homepage describes the formidable sunday evening talk show presenter as " the most powerful woman in german television . " whether it 's a long-term trend or simply a happy coincidence , most of germany 's must-see shows are currently carved up among a female elite .

already underway in eastern europe , the project will be expanded to germany in june . time is running out for simon wiesenthal and the nazis he 's been pursuing for the past 50 years .
at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .
we 're going wherever jews were murdered , " he told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive .

leipzig 's hopes of hosting the 2012 olympic games have been dashed .
the ioc overlooked the mid-sized eastern german city , instead short-listing five world-class cities to continue their olympic bids . perhaps size really does matter .
leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .

leipzig , the smallest of the nine cities vying for the 2012 games , had the underdog advantage , but that was n't enough to carry it through to the next round in the competition .
the international olympic committee instead placed new york , moscow , madrid , london , and paris on its short-list . in addition to leipzig , havana , istanbul , and rio de janeiro were also dropped from the ioc 's consideration following a unanimous decision announced by the committee 's president jacques rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- in lausanne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international olympic comittee , ioc , president jacques rogge .
" the exercise was to retain those cities who we believe would stage the best games , " rogge said .
" i do n't like the word ' rejection ' but those cities we have not retained … this in no way reflects that we do not trust these countries . " dejection , tears following the announcement , the crowd of several thousand standing in leipzig 's central market square was subdued , with more than a few teary eyes .
several people half-heartedly let go of the light-blue helium balloons they 'd been holding onto in anticipation of more joyous news . leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee , congratulated the five cities that advanced to the next round of their candidacy , though he admitted that leipzig 's defeat " hurt very , very much . "
he refrained from commenting on the success of leipzig 's competitors , saying only that his city was determined to be a " good loser . "
instead , tiefensee sought to console his disappointed citizens .
" we stand together , in good times , and also , when times are n't so good , " he said . leipzig 's olympic planning committee had no illusions about the city 's size and infrastructure , especially compared with more cosmopolitan cities on the list such as london and new york .
but rather than taking a defensive posture , leipzig - a city of 500,000 - marketed its size as a distinct advantage , promising to transform itself into " one big olympic village . " " the ioc executive made a technical decision , " said ioc vice president , thomas bach .
" leipzig 's application had two weaknesses - the missing infrastructure , and the accommodation concept .
leipzig got excellent marks in other categories . "
bach added that the olympics are just slightly too big of an event for the city at present . paris , which last hosted the olympics in 1924 , is viewed as the front-runner for 2012 .
the final decision will be announced in july of 2005 in singapore . a second chance ? leipzig 's olympic planners said they plan to take a day to recover from the disappointment , and then set about learning from the outcome , and finding out where their application went wrong .
but already there 's talk of the city trying for the olympics a second time in the future . " we should really think carefully now about how we go on from here , " said jens weissflog , a former olympic ski-jump champion .
" from the beginning , it was clear that if we did n't make it the first time around , then we should give ourselves a second chance . " but it 's the german national committee that will decide in november 2005 at the earliest , whether germany will apply to host the 2016 olympic games .
germany has twice before hosted the games - in berlin , 1936 , and in munich , 1972 .

amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .

but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .

conductor christian thielemann announced on tuesday he was stepping down over a dispute about funding .
thielmann complained that the rival staatsoper , based in the east , was getting a better deal from the city and demanded equal treatment .
but after a meeting with berlin 's top cultural official , thomas flierl , who offered the conductor only half of what he demanded , thielemann said he was leaving .
the german capital has been faced with an acute problem of arts funding since reunification , which brought together cultural venues formerly on two sides of the berlin wall .
the city 's ability to support its three opera houses has been seriously in doubt , especially since municiple debt totals some € 47 billion -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
it is unclear when exactly thielemann will leave deutsche oper ; no replacement has yet been named . more briefs 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism 14.05.2004 -pipe- berlin love parade cancelled 14.05.2004 -pipe- german citizens in debt 14.05.2004 -pipe- tempelhof air traffic grounded for good 13.05.2004 -pipe- günter grass reads for st. pauli 13.05.2004 -pipe- fewer politically motivated crimes committed in germany 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that recent terrorist attacks such as the ones in madrid in march this year that killed almost 200 people targeted so-called soft targets worldwide . " we ca n't assume that germany lies outside the reach of such targets , " schily warned , saying that in the eyes of islamic terrorists germany counted as an ally of the united states and israel and was also actively involved in the war against terrorism through its peacekeeping deployment in afghanistan . islamist groups extending influence according to the report , around 7.3 million foreigners lived in germany at the end of 2003 , among them over three million muslims . though the bfv described 57,300 foreign individuals as " radical , " the report pointed out that only a tiny majority of the muslim population - around 31,000 muslims - were active in 24 islamist organizations .
the largest membership potential was found in six turkish organizations which together have 27,300 followers . though the number of foreigners joining islamist organizations remains almost the same as last year , schily said the bfv believed that extremist islamist groups command a much larger number of covert sympathizers and had extended its influence to a wider swathe of the muslim population than a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslime pray in the mevlana mosque in kreuzberg , berlin the interior minister added that islamist groups were reaching many more people in mosques and community centers .
describing the groups as " fanatic " and " religious , " schily spoke of their " disintegrative activities " that were in particular , attracting a younger following . the minister pointed to the largest islamic organization in the country , milli görüs , which operates legally in germany but has been on the watch list of the bfv for some years now , as having a strong anti-western and anti-democratic character .
the organization specifically tries to indoctrinate muslims living in germany .
" we 're very critical of their youth work , " schily said . jihadis pose potent threat the report also said that islamists , who followed the model of jihad or holy war , posed one of the most potent dangers to the country .
it mentioned the militant islamist abu mussab al zarqawi , whose al qaeda-affiliated jordanian-based al tawhid group was accused of carrying out attacks on jewish targets in berlin and düsseldorf . according to the bfv , zarqawi also plays a central role in the radical islamic kurdish group ansar el islam , which last year was supported logistically by members in germany . the report also included the names of the mideast-based hamas militant islamic group , which has about 300 members in germany and the lebanese hizbollah militia , which is believed to have around 800 sympathizers in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan also known as caliph of cologne also mentioned is the now banned islamic organization led by metin kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the so-called " caliph of cologne " which had 800 members before it was disbanded at the end of 2001 .
the domestic intelligence services point out in the report that former members are attempting to once again set up the organization structures of the group despite the ban . drop in rightwing extremism the bfv however reported an eight percent drop in membership among rightwing extremist groups in the country to 41,500 individuals - the first significant decrease in nine years .
politically motivated rightwing crimes and violent acts also dipped by ten percent each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german neo-nazis clash with police outside a train station in frankfurt at the same time , schily said he was concerned about the 15 percent rise in neonazis to 3,000 members .

at 95 , the austrian jew is spearheading one final push to bring to justice the perpetrators of the holocaust before they die .
called " operation last chance , " the project relies on rewards , advertising campaigns , press conferences and telephone hotlines to urge people to share what they know about nazi war criminals who escaped justice . after being implemented in eastern europe and austria , the simon wiesenthal center plans to take its campaign to germany .
starting in june , it will begin tracking down nazis who have gone undetected for more than half a century .
a reward of € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,000 -rrb- awaits anyone offering information that leads to the sentencing of a person for nazi crimes . " there 's no question that there is sufficient political will in germany today to bring nazis to justice , " efraim zuroff , head of the simon wiesenthal center 's jerusalem office , told dw-radio .
new information " the basic idea behind this project is to reach individuals who have information and otherwise would never have come forward , " zuroff said .
" with all due respect to the prosecutors , we 're talking about people who have chosen until now not to make that information available . " the project was launched in 2002 in estonia , latvia and lithuania and has since also been underway in austria , poland and romania - with varied amounts of response . " it 's been extremely successful in the baltics and less successful in austria , " zuroff said .
" we 've received the names of close to 300 suspects and over 70 of those names were submitted to prosecutors . " after the center hands over the information , it 's up to the prosecutors to act on it , which is n't always a given .
" we chose to initiate the project in those countries in which there are serious problems in bringing nazis to justice , and there 's relatively little political will to do so , " zuroff lamented .
" this is a big part of the problem . "
many still in hiding zuroff is certain that there are still many former nazis in hiding in european countries , something which is evidenced in trials over the past few years , including the indictment earlier this month in italy of three former ss officers for the 1944 massacre of 560 civilians in the tuscan village sant 'anna di stazzema .
the three german men , all in their 80s , were tried in absentia and it remains unclear whether they will be extradited to italy to serve their sentences . " you have to remember that in order to carry out such a heinous crime , which resulted in the murder of six million jews and millions of others , it takes hundreds of thousands , millions of individuals who were involved in different ways , " zuroff pointed out . around 2,000 war criminals could still be living in germany , micha brumlik , the director of frankfurt 's fritz bauer institute , which is devoted to researching the holocaust , told the die tageszeitung newspaper .
brumlik reportedly tried to convince zuroff not to offer rewards for information because people would be motivated by money rather than morals .
already too late ? brumlik also doubted whether the wiesenthal project would lead to many indictments .
" it would be extraordinarily difficult to collect valid evidence , " he told the paper .
he said the fact that suspects would be very old meant they would likely never be tried or forced to serve jail sentences .
he said only nine of the cases " operation last chance " had handed over to prosecutors in the baltics were actually being investigated by the authorities . zuroff admitted , too , that he was n't optimistic about prosecutions taking place .
but time is running out .
zuroff plans to expand the project to croatia , hungary and ukraine . " there are still thousands of war criminals in europe .

it 's another coup for the eastern german city that has become one of the region 's few economic bright spots . dresden 's new chip factory , to be named fab 36 , is california-based advanced micro devices ' second plant in this city of baroque splendor and is expected to create some 1,000 jobs over the next three years .
amd 's decision to invest in dresden , located in the state of saxony , further buffs the region 's reputation as a high-tech magnet and economic success story , in sharp contrast to the rest of eastern germany . the amd plant , scheduled to open in 2006 , will be " the most advanced of its type in the world , " according to the company , which is the main rival to intel in supplying computer chips for pcs .
the factory will manufacture the 300-millimeter silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips , turning out around 13,000 wafers per month when operations begin . fab 36 is amd 's second plant in this city on the river elbe .
the first , fab 30 , another wafer-production facility , went into operation in 2000 and produced 5,000 wafers a week . chancellor gerhard schröder , who attended the groundbreaking ceremony on sunday , said the amd investment - one of the biggest in eastern germany in a decade - highlighted dresden as " the leading location for semiconductor manufacturing in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of infineon 's 300-mm wafers several other chipmakers , such as infineon and zmd have also set up shop in dresden , and given rise to the region 's moniker , " silicon saxony . " a bright spot in the east dresden 's success is made all the more striking compared to most of the rest of the former east germany , which is caught in a downward spiral of economic malaise . the region , which became a part of the federal republic of germany in 1990 , was imbued with a heady sense of optimism in the years just after reunification .
but since then , the region has been plagued with high unemployment and a rash of industry bankruptcies . even though a massive program of reconstruction was begun to bring the creaking eastern infrastructure up to western standards , the region has failed to blossom as then-chancellor helmut kohl once promised . unemployment in eastern germany is over 18 percent , almost twice that of the western part of the country . growth rates have been negative and the region has been shrinking in population as residents move west in search of jobs .
school enrollment is declining , apartment blocks in many towns stand empty , waiting not for some expected upturn , but for the wrecking ball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction site of a chip factory in the eastern german city of frankfurt / oder .
construction stopped after the 1.3 billion euro project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , pulled out .
other eastern regions have taken stabs at high-profile , high-tech projects , but several have turned into high-profile failures .
a custom chip factory that was tauted as a rejuvenator for the suffering economy in the eastern state of brandenburg declared bankruptcy late last year . dresden , however , has bucked the trend , partly thanks to its history under communism .
in east germany , the city was already a center of high-tech , since the university of dresden was the country 's leading technology school .
saxony was also the center of microelectronic production , employing some 30,000 people before the berlin wall fell .
the technology and manufacturing facilities might have been behind the west , but the skills were top notch .
the city has benefited from that base , which has acted as a magnet for companies in need of highly skilled labor . government role the state and federal governments have also played a key role in attractving companies to the region with a wide range of subsidies and incentives . for the new amd chip factory , the state of saxony invested $ 200 million .
the pot was sweetened further with the $ 540 million infusion from the federal government , part of its " eastern reconstruction " funding program .
a banking consortium headed by dresdner bank came forward with another $ 700 million in guaranteed loans from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hector ruiz , chairman of the board and ceo of amd hertor ruiz , chief executive of amd -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the $ 540 million in subsidies and loans were a " significant consideration " in deciding to come to dresden . in remarks that went against prevailing current opinion in germany , ruiz praised the country as a business location .
while many business leaders and economists bemoan the nation 's business environment , complaining of high taxes and labor costs that drive companies to set up shop abroad , ruiz said concerns over foreign investment had been " politicized . " " i 'm puzzled why people see germany so negatively , " he told reporters .
" it is certainly not the place to build a tennis show factory , but in high-tech there are many factors in its favor . "

we believe that these men were part of an organised criminal enterprise , " he said .
" a lot of planning and preparation went into the attack - but the flying squad was one step ahead of the team for some time . "
the swoop operation , codenamed cartwright , was part of the larger operation grafton , an initiative launched by the met 's specialist crime directorate in partnership with thames valley police , surrey police , hm customs and excise .
det supt phillips said the initiative had enjoyed " substantial success in dismantling the organised networks that have been operating in and around the airport " in the past year .

the gang were " career criminals " , with some known to police , det supt phillips said .
the met 's specialist crime directorate head assistant commissioner tarique ghaffur said : " a professional team of armed robbers have now been removed from society . "
airport operator baa heathrow said in a statement : " we are delighted .

building the illuminated bus stop and " covered walkway " at st nicholas way in sutton , south-west london , took about 15 months , due to engineering problems .

jostling for the attention of consumers , tesco , wal-mart and other giant retailers are working hard to fine-tune their store formats .
veggie vision : scales recognises produce by sight now hi-tech emerges as a tool to build market share .
bbc news online visited the " future store " in rheinberg , germany , set up by the world 's fifth-largest retail group , metro .
the intelligent scale does n't like our bunch of bananas .
when we had put tomatoes on the scale , its digital camera took just a split second to recognise the produce , weigh it and print a bar-coded price tag .
no wait at a checkout to have them weighed .
no need to find " tomatoes " on a 50-button display .
technology testbed intelligent scales information terminals personal shopping assistants -lrb- tablet computers -rrb- electronic price labels electronic advertising displays smart shelves smart self check-outs staff pdas rfid supply-chain management but now the scale is baffled , and offers four choices : are we weighing bananas , chicory salad , long beans or avocados ?
touching the banana logo on the screen solves the slip-up .
" the bunch of bananas was probably too large for the camera , " says an apologetic shop assistant .
welcome to metro 's future store .
new and old at first glance the supermarket looks disappointingly normal .
tablet computers on the trolley help shoppers to find their way around the store yes , to german shoppers the layout may be revolutionary , with wide " freshness aisles " right at the entrance , offering a vast and pleasantly displayed array of fresh fish , meats , vegetables , and the mouth-watering smell of freshly baked bread and donuts .
nothing new here for many french and uk shoppers .
the real revolution , though , lies with nifty machines like the intelligent scales using ibm 's veggie vision software .
the machines , so the claim goes , can identify most produce by sight , regardless of whether it is packed in a plastic bag or not .
marketing the easy way the good people of rheinberg a town of 30,000 in the west of germany are willing participants in this hi-tech experiment in retailing .
not sure what to buy ?
in key sections - multimedia , baby care , hair colours , wine , meat , and fruit and vegetables - touchscreen terminals give in-depth information .
infoterminals bring information - and a sales pitch how a particular wine tastes , which food to have with it , and a smattering of the wine region 's history - in colour , interactive , and on demand as a print-out .
learn how to cook asparagus and skin tomatoes .
get recipes for the meat and veg available and in season -lrb- courtesy of nestle , whose products just happen to crop up in some of the recipes -rrb- .
above the aisles , large flat screens show still pictures and videos of special offers and promotions .
" customers buy more when we have two screens next to each other showing the same product , " says metro 's holger schneidewindt .
a quick scan of a product barcode , a few taps on a handheld computer , and the wireless network changes the display on the large flat screen above a shelf groaning with bottles of vodka and schnapps .
for managers of the 4,000 square metre store , it is marketing the easy way .
do n't scream for ice cream personal shopping assistants -lrb- psa -rrb- are the clincher , though - small wincor nixdorf tablet computers clipped to shopping trolleys and activated with a loyalty card .
personal shopping assistants cut down on waiting time at the checkout want some ice cream but do n't know where to find it ?
type " ice cream " on the touch screen and you are directed to the correct aisle - floor plan included .
regular purchases show up on a favourites list , with price and location .
special offers are flagged up as you move from section to section .
write your shopping list online - at home or work - and soon it will be automatically downloaded to the psa .
the integrated scanner gives you both a running total of your shopping and fast-track treatment at the check-out .
smart logistics the shop 's shelves sport 30,000 wireless electronic price labels that can be changed at the push of a button .
smart self-scan check-outs , meanwhile , tackle fraud by comparing the weight of your shopping bag with the items you scanned and prevent underage drinking by prompting staff to check out customers scanning alcoholic products .
rfid explained rfid : radio frequency identification tag : tiny microchip with unique id number attached to small antenna reader : tags going past readers are read in split second and reported to data base talking barcodes that change our lifes q & a : rfid explained the future store 's biggest potential , though , is its use of rfid tags , a kind of " talking barcodes " .
with the help of software from business process expert sap , metro now knows in detail how supplies move from the essen distribution centre on to trucks , into the rheinberg store room , and on to the shop floor .
the result : the inventory is always up-to-date , shelves are rarely empty , and losses are down .
at its most revolutionary , smart shelves using rfid - currently tested on gilette razor blades , pantene shampoo and philadelphia cream cheese - alert staff when the shop 's shelves are getting empty or cheese packs are past their sell-by date .
are rheinbergers geeks ?
smart shelves use radio tags to control stocks one year into the experiment , the people of rheinberg have taken to the store with gusto .
" customers come to the store more frequently , store loyalty is up and sales are up 30 % , " says metro spokesman albrecht von truchsess .
to a large part that is due to the store 's new " fresh and easy " format .
but more than 70 % of customers have used the various technologies at least once , and a hard core of regular users -lrb- 21 % for psas , 53 % for the scales -rrb- is growing strongly .
and it is the over-60s , not just the geeks of this rural area , who are among the keenest to use the new technology .
looking past the bottom line but does the future store make a profit ?
not in the traditional sense .
ultimately , it is just a large laboratory , using customised bleeding-edge technology .
customers can wipe clean the rfid tags on their goods " one ca n't talk about return on investment for such a store , " says metro 's mr von truchsess .
and anyway , for metro 's 45 technology partners , this is a giant " bring your own technology " party , where each partner 's costs are neither disclosed nor added up .
for metro , meanwhile , it is an opportunity to find out whether better service and a streamlined supply chain can help it compete with germany 's ultra-cheap grocery discounters like lidl and aldi .
but it is also a way to identify potential trouble , for example to see whether radio interference can trip over large rfid systems .
there is just one problem .
surveys suggest that some customers dazzled by the snazzy technology think prices must be higher as well .
not so , says metro 's mr von truchsess .
but he admits : " there will always be certain areas where customers will not accept a high-technology store " .

are rheinbergers geeks ?
smart shelves use radio tags to control stocks one year into the experiment , the people of rheinberg have taken to the store with gusto .

not in the traditional sense .

and anyway , for metro 's 45 technology partners , this is a giant " bring your own technology " party , where each partner 's costs are neither disclosed nor added up .
for metro , meanwhile , it is an opportunity to find out whether better service and a streamlined supply chain can help it compete with germany 's ultra-cheap grocery discounters like lidl and aldi .
but it is also a way to identify potential trouble , for example to see whether radio interference can trip over large rfid systems .
there is just one problem .
surveys suggest that some customers dazzled by the snazzy technology think prices must be higher as well .
not so , says metro 's mr von truchsess .
but he admits : " there will always be certain areas where customers will not accept a high-technology store " .

the sculpture of the hull-born reformer was created in 1833 , but has previously only been displayed privately .
now , visitors to the wilberforce house museum in hull can see the marble bust in all its glory .
it was created by the scottish sculptor samuel joseph , who also made a full length statue of wilberforce for display at westminster abbey .
the wilberforce trust , based in york , has given the bust to the museum on a long-term loan .
yorkshire great museum spokeswoman jayne tyler said : " we are very grateful to the trust for loaning us such an important bust of wilberforce for display .
" it is really good to see this special work of art on display in the birthplace of the abolitionist . "
samuel joseph , who was a founder member of the royal scottish academy , was recognised as scotland 's foremost sculptor after his death in 1850 .
his busts were described in british literature and art as " superior to any examples of sculptural art that has been produced in scotland previous to his practice " .
wilberforce , the son of a wealthy merchant , was born in 1759 in hull and represented the city as mp .
he campaigned tirelessly for the abolition of slavery , with the campaign succeeding shortly after his death in 1833 .
in march 2004 , he was voted the greatest yorkshireman that ever lived by a panel after being nominated by bbc viewers .

after tarnation screened for the second time in cannes , caouette - its director , editor and main character - stood up .
a spotlight was thrown on him and he fought back tears as the cinema crowd gave him a standing ovation .
the audience had just watched his life story .
a texan child whose mother was in shock therapy , caouette , 31 , was abused in foster care and saw his mother 's condition worsen as a result of her " treatment " .
he began filming himself and his family aged 11 , and created movie fantasies as an escape .
the whole time i was editing the film , there were tears coming and there was this pulling coming from my stomach jonathan caouette for tarnation , he has spliced his home movie footage together to create a moving and uncomfortable self-portrait .
and using a home computer with basic editing software , caouette did it all for a fraction of the price of a hollywood blockbuster like troy .
" what happened with the standing ovation was the most amazing response i 've got from this film in my life , " he told bbc news online .
" i felt like diana ross in the last scene of mahogany or lady sings the blues .
it was so surreal and such an out-of-body experience .
the film documents his mother 's mental health problems " it felt like a flash was going to go off and everything was going to freeze frame and credits were going to roll and i was going to wake up from some elongated dream that i 've been having . "
caouette said he had been " inadvertently making this film for 20 years " , and telling his story was a cathartic process he needed to go through .
but reviewing and editing his tapes - from his early acting performances to footage of his deteriorating mother - was also " extremely painful " , he said .
" the whole time i was editing the film , there were tears coming and there was this pulling coming from my stomach - it was unlike anything i 'd ever experienced . "
last year 's cannes palme d 'or-winning director gus van sant and hedwig and the angry inch film-maker john cameron mitchell liked it so much they came on board as executive producers .
the director said he has had offers to make other films " john and gus have both given their championships to the film and endorsed the film as executive producers , " caouette said .
the film 's reputation has grown rapidly - the finished version was only finalised for the sundance film festival in january , after which the director received hugs from strangers who had seen it .
it is now in the prestigious un certain regard section at cannes .
" what a way to introduce yourself to an industry that you 've always fantasised about being in , " caouette said .
" i was really reluctant at the beginning to take it to this level - but now that i 'm here , it 's the most freeing thing i 've ever experienced in my life . "
caouette in a scene from the film as for the budget , which has attracted as much attention as the subject matter , caouette said he had added up how much he spent on video tapes - plus a set of angel wings - over the years .
but the total spent will rise to about $ 400,000 -lrb- £ 230,000 -rrb- , he said , once rights for music and video clips he used to illustrate a mood or era have been paid for .
although tarnation is a unique and highly personal project , caouette said he has had several offers at cannes for future films , and would like to make a " parapsychological horror " .
but he will not ditch tarnation 's style , and is inspired by danish director lars von trier , he said .
" i love the idea of making a narrative where it feels like the audience member is peeping in on something that they do n't necessarily know if they should be peeping in on . "

the whole time i was editing the film , there were tears coming and there was this pulling coming from my stomach jonathan caouette for tarnation , he has spliced his home movie footage together to create a moving and uncomfortable self-portrait .
and using a home computer with basic editing software , caouette did it all for a fraction of the price of a hollywood blockbuster like troy .
" what happened with the standing ovation was the most amazing response i 've got from this film in my life , " he told bbc news online .
" i felt like diana ross in the last scene of mahogany or lady sings the blues .
it was so surreal and such an out-of-body experience .
the film documents his mother 's mental health problems " it felt like a flash was going to go off and everything was going to freeze frame and credits were going to roll and i was going to wake up from some elongated dream that i 've been having . "
caouette said he had been " inadvertently making this film for 20 years " , and telling his story was a cathartic process he needed to go through .
but reviewing and editing his tapes - from his early acting performances to footage of his deteriorating mother - was also " extremely painful " , he said .
" the whole time i was editing the film , there were tears coming and there was this pulling coming from my stomach - it was unlike anything i 'd ever experienced . "
last year 's cannes palme d 'or-winning director gus van sant and hedwig and the angry inch film-maker john cameron mitchell liked it so much they came on board as executive producers .
the director said he has had offers to make other films " john and gus have both given their championships to the film and endorsed the film as executive producers , " caouette said .
the film 's reputation has grown rapidly - the finished version was only finalised for the sundance film festival in january , after which the director received hugs from strangers who had seen it .
it is now in the prestigious un certain regard section at cannes .
" what a way to introduce yourself to an industry that you 've always fantasised about being in , " caouette said .
" i was really reluctant at the beginning to take it to this level - but now that i 'm here , it 's the most freeing thing i 've ever experienced in my life . "
caouette in a scene from the film as for the budget , which has attracted as much attention as the subject matter , caouette said he had added up how much he spent on video tapes - plus a set of angel wings - over the years .
but the total spent will rise to about $ 400,000 -lrb- £ 230,000 -rrb- , he said , once rights for music and video clips he used to illustrate a mood or era have been paid for .
although tarnation is a unique and highly personal project , caouette said he has had several offers at cannes for future films , and would like to make a " parapsychological horror " .
but he will not ditch tarnation 's style , and is inspired by danish director lars von trier , he said .
" i love the idea of making a narrative where it feels like the audience member is peeping in on something that they do n't necessarily know if they should be peeping in on . "

' winning concept ' syha marketing manager jason clark said : " up until three years ago , many of our hostels simply closed from the end of the summer until the following spring .
" rentahostel has proved a winning concept , by maximising use of our assets and offering a new product based on our existing hostel network .
" the success of rentahostel has also benefited many rural economies of scotland where additional business outwith the traditional tourist season is most welcome . "
the scheme won a visitscotland thistle award in 2001 .
typical uses for rentahostel include club meetings , parties , family gatherings and reunions , with wedding receptions proving especially popular at the syha 's flagship carbisdale castle in sutherland , and at auchendrennan house , loch lomond .

interviews with men who have attacked their partners will be screened at the federation 's conference in bournemouth .
the videos designed to highlight the extent of the problem are described as " shock tactics " by bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw .
training for new police recruits on domestic violence is being cut from 15 to 12 weeks .
understanding ' critical ' in the videos two unidentified men describe how they abused their partners .
" the police federation denies that it is giving perpetrators a platform and say the aim is to raise awareness of domestic violence amongst officers , " said danny shaw .
cutting training is really not going to help those women who desperately need the police to be sympathetic and understanding and to be able to respond quickly to their situation myra johnson , women 's aid myra johnson , from the domestic violence charity women 's aid , said officers should give greater priority to training .
" i think it 's critically important that police have a real understanding of what domestic violence is , " she said .
" very often we hear about cases where police do n't really have an understanding about what the woman is going through . "
she described the videos as " incredibly powerful stuff and incredibly frightening " .
ms johnson said a quarter of women would experience domestic violence at some time in their life .
" cutting training is really not going to help those women who desperately need the police to be sympathetic and understanding and to be able to respond quickly to their situation .
plea to victims " domestic violence accounts for 20 % of all violent crime so we have to see it as a real priority . "
the conference will also hear a plea from solicitor general harriet harman , for victims who have suffered in silence to come forward .
she told gmtv it was difficult but essential for them to stand opposite their partner in court .
" the message does have to get across - if you attack your wife or partner that is every bit as much a crime as if you attack somebody in the street , " she said .
" there is no excuse .
" saying ' i 'm sorry ' afterwards is no longer good enough .
the criminal law must step in because otherwise it carries on . "
