program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.09.2004 galileo : europe 's own constellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the galileo satellite navigation system for years , the galileo satellite navigation system was seen as a barrier to transatlantic relations .
but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .

galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .

" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .

" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .

" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .

by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .

friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .
22 , 1947 .
friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .

what few people know , is that a single record label is responsible for the sound of the triumphant moment . the show is perfect .
the winner takes to the podium , receives a gold medal and watches as the national flag is raised for all to see .
it 's a proud moment , a patriotic moment .
and the tears swell up in the champion 's eyes .
for record label naxos it 's a golden moment when the olympian 's national anthem blares out of the speakers for all to hear .
the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .
political circumstances , shifting borders and independence have all left their mark on national anthems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a copy of every national anthem is no easy job for naxos , compiling such a collection means establishing contact with national embassies , ordering current musical notation for the pieces , clarifying legal rights and then adapting the anthems for symphonic interpretation by a single orchestra .
" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .
the worldwide presence the company wins throught the olympics is not intended to be used for advertisement - in fact , the record label intentionally refrains from drawing attention to its musical contribution .
instead , the motto for the company is more olympian - " being there is everything . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .
negotiations just beginning kazbek dzantiyev , head of the region 's interior ministry , said the hostages had threatened that " for every destroyed fighter , they will kill 50 children and for every injured fighter , 20 -lrb- children -rrb- . "
valery andreyev , head of the fsb security service in north ossetia province told reporters that officials would refrain from using force to free the hostages .
" there is no question at the moment of opting for force , " he said .
" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face . while athletes from around the world strive for a gold medal , the international olympic committee is doing its best at keeping its 11 top sponsors happy .
the global corporations expect nothing less after investing a total of about € 693 million -lrb- $ 854 million -rrb- in the athens games .
the most the ioc can do is keep out the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .
what is supposed to be a fair and open field for the athletes is anything but that when sponsors come to town .
on the watch once spectators get their tickets - visa being the only credit card accepted at ticket counters - ticket rippers are doing more than just making sure everyone sits in the right section .
they 're also on the lookout for the wrong logos .
flags , shirts and bags with rival trademarks are banned .
so are flags from non-participating countries and banners larger than one square meter .
try brining a whopper into the mcdonald 's-only games and you 'll be left hungry .
in fact , no food is allowed to be brought into the olympic venues except for medical reasons - even water bottles bearing the wrong label have been prohibited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic ticket windows only accept visa but spectators should n't feel they 're the only ones under the sponsor police 's eye .
athletes and trainers face similar scrutiny .
when the supply cars that deliver goods to long-distance cyclists are n't from the olympic partner , their trademarks have to be hidden too .
only small logos from national team and individual athlete sponsors are allowed on competitor 's clothes .
ambush marketing the ioc is n't trying to make anyone 's life miserable .
it 's an effort to protect official sponsors from the ambush marketing tactics of non-sponsors attempting to get some cheap , or free , publicity .
nike is probably the most famous ambush marketer .
it tried stealing adidas ' thunder at the 1996 olympics by buying huge billboards outside the venues and even built a kiosk next to centennial olympic park in atlanta .
ioc members fear devastating consequences if such underhanded tactics pay off .
sponsors would stop paying big bucks for official name placement , and without sponsors ' money , many sporting events would never take place .
" if allowed to go unchecked , it will destroy the foundation of sport , " michael payne , director of global broadcasting for the olympics , said of ambush marketing .
but that wo n't happen anytime soon .
many sponsors have already signed contracts guaranteeing them exclusive rights for the 2012 games , wherever they 'll be held . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

what few people know , is that a single record label is responsible for the sound of the triumphant moment . the show is perfect .
the winner takes to the podium , receives a gold medal and watches as the national flag is raised for all to see .
it 's a proud moment , a patriotic moment .
and the tears swell up in the champion 's eyes .
for record label naxos it 's a golden moment when the olympian 's national anthem blares out of the speakers for all to hear .
the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .
political circumstances , shifting borders and independence have all left their mark on national anthems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a copy of every national anthem is no easy job for naxos , compiling such a collection means establishing contact with national embassies , ordering current musical notation for the pieces , clarifying legal rights and then adapting the anthems for symphonic interpretation by a single orchestra .
" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .
the worldwide presence the company wins throught the olympics is not intended to be used for advertisement - in fact , the record label intentionally refrains from drawing attention to its musical contribution .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

its report called " how green are the games " states that " green energy is the most striking failure for the athens olympics . "
" for a country that markets itself as a country of endless sunshine , solar energy for the games should n't be so difficult .
but green energy at the games is close to zero , " the greenpeace report said , adding that athens represents a step backwards from sydney 2000 , where the solar powered olympic village became the world 's largest solar suburb .
it was later sold as public housing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village is the largest solar suburb " utilization of solar energy in construction and maintenance , pvc phase out , development of car-free zones and saving of heritage sites from construction perils were key take homes from the sydney olympics .
but no attempt was made by athoc to understand or learn from experiences at sydney , " said shailendra yashwant , international campaigns director at greenpeace .
the world wildlife fund was equally critical in the run-up to the games , issuing a scorecard that failed athens organizers in almost every category .
" greece must now move forward and look at what can be done to reverse the environmental impacts the day after the games , " said demetres karavellas , the wwf 's director in greece .
wetlands protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rowing and canoeing will take place near the coastal forest one of the most controversial issues is the development of the schinias wetland and coastal forest into a venue to host the rowing and canoeing competitions .
environmental ngo 's argues that the schinias wetland is one of the few left in the region , and should be protected .
the wwf accused the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- of indifference , saying it failed to hold athoc to its environmental promises .
even the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- lamented that environmental promises for the athens olympics had " fallen short . "
the ioc has insisted that respect for the environment was a priority in preparing for the games .
" we 've worked closely with the athens organizing committee to ensure environmental protection measures were considered right from the start , " said ioc spokeswoman giselle davies .
environment-friendly features athoc has said that while it pressed contractors to include environmentally friendly features in all the sports venues , it could not force them to do so .
athoc also pointed to its green successes , which include measures such as creating more public transportation , planting a million large bushes and almost 300,000 trees , placing recycling bins at venues , and using organic pesticide against mosquitoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport is one of athens ' greener accomplishments unep is working with athoc on a series of public awareness activities such as an anti-littering campaign , so that at least visitors at the games will be reminded of the need to protect the environment .
" respect for nature was a feature of ancient greek civilization , " said unep 's executive director klaus töpfer .
" in those early games , victors were crowned with an olive wreath .
the olive wreath remains an olympic symbol to this day , a reminder of the precious link between humankind and the natural environment that we must learn to better preserve and cherish .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .
" they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.09.2004 cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the gods know how much the olympics will cost in the end there is never a shortage of cities vying to shine a light on themselves and welcome the world 's top athletes by hosting the olympics .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face . while athletes from around the world strive for a gold medal , the international olympic committee is doing its best at keeping its 11 top sponsors happy .
the global corporations expect nothing less after investing a total of about € 693 million -lrb- $ 854 million -rrb- in the athens games .
the most the ioc can do is keep out the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .
what is supposed to be a fair and open field for the athletes is anything but that when sponsors come to town .
on the watch once spectators get their tickets - visa being the only credit card accepted at ticket counters - ticket rippers are doing more than just making sure everyone sits in the right section .
they 're also on the lookout for the wrong logos .
flags , shirts and bags with rival trademarks are banned .
so are flags from non-participating countries and banners larger than one square meter .
try brining a whopper into the mcdonald 's-only games and you 'll be left hungry .
in fact , no food is allowed to be brought into the olympic venues except for medical reasons - even water bottles bearing the wrong label have been prohibited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic ticket windows only accept visa but spectators should n't feel they 're the only ones under the sponsor police 's eye .
athletes and trainers face similar scrutiny .
when the supply cars that deliver goods to long-distance cyclists are n't from the olympic partner , their trademarks have to be hidden too .
only small logos from national team and individual athlete sponsors are allowed on competitor 's clothes .
ambush marketing the ioc is n't trying to make anyone 's life miserable .
it 's an effort to protect official sponsors from the ambush marketing tactics of non-sponsors attempting to get some cheap , or free , publicity .
nike is probably the most famous ambush marketer .
it tried stealing adidas ' thunder at the 1996 olympics by buying huge billboards outside the venues and even built a kiosk next to centennial olympic park in atlanta .
ioc members fear devastating consequences if such underhanded tactics pay off .
sponsors would stop paying big bucks for official name placement , and without sponsors ' money , many sporting events would never take place .
" if allowed to go unchecked , it will destroy the foundation of sport , " michael payne , director of global broadcasting for the olympics , said of ambush marketing .
but that wo n't happen anytime soon .
many sponsors have already signed contracts guaranteeing them exclusive rights for the 2012 games , wherever they 'll be held . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

its report called " how green are the games " states that " green energy is the most striking failure for the athens olympics . "
" for a country that markets itself as a country of endless sunshine , solar energy for the games should n't be so difficult .
but green energy at the games is close to zero , " the greenpeace report said , adding that athens represents a step backwards from sydney 2000 , where the solar powered olympic village became the world 's largest solar suburb .
it was later sold as public housing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village is the largest solar suburb " utilization of solar energy in construction and maintenance , pvc phase out , development of car-free zones and saving of heritage sites from construction perils were key take homes from the sydney olympics .
but no attempt was made by athoc to understand or learn from experiences at sydney , " said shailendra yashwant , international campaigns director at greenpeace .
the world wildlife fund was equally critical in the run-up to the games , issuing a scorecard that failed athens organizers in almost every category .
" greece must now move forward and look at what can be done to reverse the environmental impacts the day after the games , " said demetres karavellas , the wwf 's director in greece .
wetlands protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rowing and canoeing will take place near the coastal forest one of the most controversial issues is the development of the schinias wetland and coastal forest into a venue to host the rowing and canoeing competitions .
environmental ngo 's argues that the schinias wetland is one of the few left in the region , and should be protected .
the wwf accused the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- of indifference , saying it failed to hold athoc to its environmental promises .
even the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- lamented that environmental promises for the athens olympics had " fallen short . "
the ioc has insisted that respect for the environment was a priority in preparing for the games .
" we 've worked closely with the athens organizing committee to ensure environmental protection measures were considered right from the start , " said ioc spokeswoman giselle davies .
environment-friendly features athoc has said that while it pressed contractors to include environmentally friendly features in all the sports venues , it could not force them to do so .
athoc also pointed to its green successes , which include measures such as creating more public transportation , planting a million large bushes and almost 300,000 trees , placing recycling bins at venues , and using organic pesticide against mosquitoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport is one of athens ' greener accomplishments unep is working with athoc on a series of public awareness activities such as an anti-littering campaign , so that at least visitors at the games will be reminded of the need to protect the environment .
" respect for nature was a feature of ancient greek civilization , " said unep 's executive director klaus töpfer .
" in those early games , victors were crowned with an olive wreath .
the olive wreath remains an olympic symbol to this day , a reminder of the precious link between humankind and the natural environment that we must learn to better preserve and cherish .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said . " these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks .

negotiators call the release a " first success . " on thursday afternoon , the armed and masked gang of terrorists holed up in a school in the north ossetia region on the southern russian border released 26 women and children , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
but relatives of the more than 300 other hostages waited helplessly outside the school in the town of beslan as negotiations continued into the second day of the hostage crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past armed guards stationed outside the school casualty reports are varied , but according to an unnamed source from the joint-command operation for the crisis , 16 people were killed and another 13 injured after a gang of 20 masked and heavily armed men and women dressed in black burst into the courtyard of a secondary school in the town of beslan early wednesday morning , taking some 350 people hostage , including 200 school children .
the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .

" our main task is , of course , to save the life and health of those who have been taken hostage .
all the actions of our forces , who are dealing with freeing the hostages , will be devoted to solving this task , " he said on thursday .

witnesses described seeing a billowing could of black smoke rising from the site , but no explanations were given .
since the hostage-taking several gunshots and minor explosions have gone off inside the school building .

they have threatened to blow up the building if security forces move in .
some reports also said the gunmen , who had apparently mined the perimeter of the school , were demanding the release of rebels imprisoned in ingushetia following a deadly raid there in june .
a man inside the school reportedly told the new york times on wednesday that he represented the second group of salakhin riadus shakhidi , a rebel contingent believed to be headed by chechnya 's most notorious rebel commander , shamil basayev .
the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .

" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

" but if you look at the broader picture , it is a drop in the ocean .
the is plenty of work ahead , " he told reporters .
the gunmen , roshal said , were still refusing requests to allow food and water into the school .
the pediatrician worried that an unsuccessful end to the crisis could plunge the region into a war between varied ethnic groups .
" i appeal to the wisdom of the ingush , ossetian and chechen peoples to avoid a war , otherwise thousands of lives will be lost . "

militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 02.09.2004 gunmen release some russian hostages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screaming babies are carried to safety , while 300 more hostages await their fate camouflaged russian security agents carried babies to safety after militants holding hundreds of hostages in a besieged school release 26 women and children .
negotiators call the release a " first success . " on thursday afternoon , the armed and masked gang of terrorists holed up in a school in the north ossetia region on the southern russian border released 26 women and children , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
but relatives of the more than 300 other hostages waited helplessly outside the school in the town of beslan as negotiations continued into the second day of the hostage crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past armed guards stationed outside the school casualty reports are varied , but according to an unnamed source from the joint-command operation for the crisis , 16 people were killed and another 13 injured after a gang of 20 masked and heavily armed men and women dressed in black burst into the courtyard of a secondary school in the town of beslan early wednesday morning , taking some 350 people hostage , including 200 school children .
the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .
saving lives main priority in his first public remarks since the hostage-taking , russian president vladimir putin pledged to do everything possible to save the lives of the those being held up in the school .
" our main task is , of course , to save the life and health of those who have been taken hostage .
all the actions of our forces , who are dealing with freeing the hostages , will be devoted to solving this task , " he said on thursday .
meanwhile , some 24 hours after the terrorists seized the school , two large explosions about 10 minutes apart rang out from the area of the cordoned-off building .
witnesses described seeing a billowing could of black smoke rising from the site , but no explanations were given .
since the hostage-taking several gunshots and minor explosions have gone off inside the school building .
threatening force the crisis began wednesday morning when hostage takers herded the children and adults into a gym and demanded to meet with the head of the local region of north ossetia and neighboring ingushetia , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
they have threatened to blow up the building if security forces move in .
some reports also said the gunmen , who had apparently mined the perimeter of the school , were demanding the release of rebels imprisoned in ingushetia following a deadly raid there in june .
a man inside the school reportedly told the new york times on wednesday that he represented the second group of salakhin riadus shakhidi , a rebel contingent believed to be headed by chechnya 's most notorious rebel commander , shamil basayev .
the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .
negotiations just beginning kazbek dzantiyev , head of the region 's interior ministry , said the hostages had threatened that " for every destroyed fighter , they will kill 50 children and for every injured fighter , 20 -lrb- children -rrb- . "
valery andreyev , head of the fsb security service in north ossetia province told reporters that officials would refrain from using force to free the hostages .
" there is no question at the moment of opting for force , " he said .
" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pediatrician leonid roshal -lrb- left -rrb- and another unidentified doctor remove the body of a hostage killed inside a moscow theatre seized by armed chechens in oct .
2002 the negotiations involve well-known pediatrician leonid roshal -lrb- photo -rrb- , who assisted hostages during the deadly siege of the moscow theater two years ago .
russia 's ntv television reported that roshal , whose participation the militants had demanded , conveyed to the hostage-takers the promise of a safe corridor out , but the offer was allegedly refused .
after the 26 hostages were released on thursday roshal described the situation as an initial victory .
" but if you look at the broader picture , it is a drop in the ocean .
the is plenty of work ahead , " he told reporters .
the gunmen , roshal said , were still refusing requests to allow food and water into the school .
the pediatrician worried that an unsuccessful end to the crisis could plunge the region into a war between varied ethnic groups .
" i appeal to the wisdom of the ingush , ossetian and chechen peoples to avoid a war , otherwise thousands of lives will be lost . "
lack of information bildunterschrift : soldiers helped a small girl who escaped on wednesday as talks continued on and off throughout the night and into the second day of the crisis , details about who the gunmen are and what they want still remained unclear .
although suspicion falls heavily on chechen involvement , no one has claimed responsibility yet .
chechen rebel leader aslan maskhadov has denied involvement of separatists in the hostage drama .
distraught parents and relatives gathering in hundreds in the streets surrounding the school have demanded more information .
" no one tells us anything .
some people say the terrorists are chechens .
some people say they are arabs , but we do n't know , " nikolai dzaparov , husband and grandfather of two hostages complained on russian tv .

spate of attacks the hostage-taking in north ossetia has rocketed terrorism to the very center of russian consciousness following a series of attacks in the last few days .
tuesday evening a car bomb exploded outside a crowded moscow subway station during rush hour .
the blast , which killed ten people and left scores injured , was claimed by the same group that said it was responsible for last week 's crash of two russian planes that killed 90 people .

31 , 2004 " in essence , war has been declared on us , where the enemy is unseen and there is no front , " defense minister sergei ivanov said to reporters after the series of attacks , but before the hostage-taking put the nation even more on edge .
the hostage crisis at the school has revived painful memories of the moscow theater hostage-taking in 2002 , during which 130 people died after police used a poison gas when they stormed the building .
successful escape in addition to the 26 hostages who were released thursday , 50 children managed to escape capture after they hid in a school boiler room , itar-tass reported .
another 14 pupils managed to escape from the building afterwards , the north ossetia presidential spokesman told interfax news agency .
all entrances to north ossetia from neighboring republics have been closed , the republic 's prime minister told interfax .
we have increased security measures in all towns , " including all schools and kindergartens , he said .
putin also mobilized national security forces to protect nuclear facilities across the country .
emergency security council meeting speaking to russian television putin said that what is happening in north ossetia is especially horrible , " not only because some of the hostages are children , but because this action can explode even a fragile balance of interconfessional and international relations in the region . "
president putin , who broke off travel plans to turkey called for an emergency meeting of the un security council following the hostage-taking .
un secretary-general kofi anan on tuesday strongly condemned the attack at the moscow station and demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all the hostages . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin defends chechnya policy at talks russian president vladimir putin defended his stance on chechnya during talks with germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac on tuesday after both questioned him on the matter .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution .

" twenty years ago you went to turkey on the look-out for exciting theater and you seldom found anything worth bringing back to germany , " he said .
" when you go these days there 's a real sense of change , you discover all sorts of young , new projects with a lot of broad appeal .

" to what extent does europe identify with this country , and to what extent does turkey identify with europe ? " it 's a question many of the artists featured in simdi now have an answer to .

" what they 're doing is seeking out a new , enlightened and open-minded position . " nikki kawamura emphasized that the festival is based on the principle of cultural exchange - one which not only prompts germany to focus on turkey , but which might also inspire berlin 's turkish community to reassess what 's happening in their country of origin and perhaps rebuild a sense of kinship .

" nikki kawamura emphasized that the festival is based on the principle of cultural exchange - one which not only prompts germany to focus on turkey , but which might also inspire berlin 's turkish community to reassess what 's happening in their country of origin and perhaps rebuild a sense of kinship .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .

" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .

thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face . while athletes from around the world strive for a gold medal , the international olympic committee is doing its best at keeping its 11 top sponsors happy .
the global corporations expect nothing less after investing a total of about € 693 million -lrb- $ 854 million -rrb- in the athens games .
the most the ioc can do is keep out the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .
what is supposed to be a fair and open field for the athletes is anything but that when sponsors come to town .
on the watch once spectators get their tickets - visa being the only credit card accepted at ticket counters - ticket rippers are doing more than just making sure everyone sits in the right section .
they 're also on the lookout for the wrong logos .
flags , shirts and bags with rival trademarks are banned .
so are flags from non-participating countries and banners larger than one square meter .

only small logos from national team and individual athlete sponsors are allowed on competitor 's clothes .
ambush marketing the ioc is n't trying to make anyone 's life miserable .
it 's an effort to protect official sponsors from the ambush marketing tactics of non-sponsors attempting to get some cheap , or free , publicity .

what few people know , is that a single record label is responsible for the sound of the triumphant moment . the show is perfect .
the winner takes to the podium , receives a gold medal and watches as the national flag is raised for all to see .
it 's a proud moment , a patriotic moment .
and the tears swell up in the champion 's eyes .
for record label naxos it 's a golden moment when the olympian 's national anthem blares out of the speakers for all to hear .
the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .
political circumstances , shifting borders and independence have all left their mark on national anthems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a copy of every national anthem is no easy job for naxos , compiling such a collection means establishing contact with national embassies , ordering current musical notation for the pieces , clarifying legal rights and then adapting the anthems for symphonic interpretation by a single orchestra .
" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .
the worldwide presence the company wins throught the olympics is not intended to be used for advertisement - in fact , the record label intentionally refrains from drawing attention to its musical contribution .

what few people know , is that a single record label is responsible for the sound of the triumphant moment . the show is perfect .

it 's a proud moment , a patriotic moment .

the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .
political circumstances , shifting borders and independence have all left their mark on national anthems .

" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .

friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .

by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu erdogan : " we have done our homework " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.09.2004 capturing turkish culture 's changing face großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapper sultan tunc has byzantine , christian and islamic influences berlin is currently playing host to " simdi now " , germany 's largest ever festival of turkish culture featuring over 50 events ranging from classical music to video installations and experimental club sounds . the sheer wealth of talent that 's blossomed on the bosphorus in recent years is finally getting the platform it deserves . from classical to pop music , stand-up comedy to contemporary dance and traditional to modern art , the distinguishing feature of today 's turkish culture has always been its inspirational juxtaposition of western and eastern influences - a quality perfectly captured in the simdi -lrb- now -rrb- now festival 's eclectic program . co-initiator nilgün mirze from the istanbul foundation for art and culture said her organization has always been far busier importing european culture to turkey rather than exporting turkish culture to the rest of europe .
the interest simply was n't there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home sweet home " what 's happened so far is that all the popular culture was exported , what is known to be touristic , " she told deutsche welle .
" i think maybe europe was n't curious enough to find out what was going on in turkey . " a one-sided picture that all changed when she met project manager nikki kawamura , who hails from kreuzberg , home to a large percentage of berlin 's 200,000-strong turkish community . often described as little istanbul , it 's a run-down neighbourhood populated by traditional migrant families . " the picture of daily life within the turkish community that you see in kreuzberg is very one-sided , " observes kawamura .
" i always thought there must be more to -lrb- turkish culture -rrb- than this . " its full breadth is now showcased in the trailblazing festival co-organized by the istanbul foundation for art and culture , london 's harrison parrot artists ' management and berlin 's werkstatt der kulturen . radical changes andreas freudenberg from the latter organization pointed out that turkish culture is currently undergoing radical changes . " twenty years ago you went to turkey on the look-out for exciting theater and you seldom found anything worth bringing back to germany , " he said .
" when you go these days there 's a real sense of change , you discover all sorts of young , new projects with a lot of broad appeal . " he 's quick to put turkey 's rapidly evolving identity in an international context . " it 's important to consider turkey 's relations with europe and europe 's relations with turkey , " he said .
" to what extent does europe identify with this country , and to what extent does turkey identify with europe ? " it 's a question many of the artists featured in simdi now have an answer to .
the message coming across as the festival unfolds is loud and clear : these young turks have no qualms about describing themselves as european . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener -lrb- second from left -rrb- after winning the eurovision song contest in 2003 sertab erener -lrb- photo -rrb- demonstrated the exportability of modern turkish culture by winning the 2003 eurovision song contest , while popstar and pin-up tarkan -lrb- photo below -rrb- recently released an album of tracks sung in english and can rest assured he 'll go down in history as the first turkish artist to land a top 10 hit in germany . turkey 's unique status while simdi now boasts an impressive line-up of acts that provide a glimpse of dynamic new developments in contemporary turkish culture , it also highlights the country 's musical and artistic traditions - albeit often spiced up with experimental elements . turkey 's unique status as a gateway between europe and asia gives the country a significance that simdi now 's organizers are acutely aware of . bildunterschrift : tarkan " many of these new projects involve an exploration of turkey 's relationship with western civilization and with the islamic world , " freudenberg said .

the interest simply was n't there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home sweet home " what 's happened so far is that all the popular culture was exported , what is known to be touristic , " she told deutsche welle .
" i think maybe europe was n't curious enough to find out what was going on in turkey . " a one-sided picture that all changed when she met project manager nikki kawamura , who hails from kreuzberg , home to a large percentage of berlin 's 200,000-strong turkish community . often described as little istanbul , it 's a run-down neighbourhood populated by traditional migrant families . " the picture of daily life within the turkish community that you see in kreuzberg is very one-sided , " observes kawamura .
" i always thought there must be more to -lrb- turkish culture -rrb- than this . " its full breadth is now showcased in the trailblazing festival co-organized by the istanbul foundation for art and culture , london 's harrison parrot artists ' management and berlin 's werkstatt der kulturen . radical changes andreas freudenberg from the latter organization pointed out that turkish culture is currently undergoing radical changes . " twenty years ago you went to turkey on the look-out for exciting theater and you seldom found anything worth bringing back to germany , " he said .
" when you go these days there 's a real sense of change , you discover all sorts of young , new projects with a lot of broad appeal . " he 's quick to put turkey 's rapidly evolving identity in an international context . " it 's important to consider turkey 's relations with europe and europe 's relations with turkey , " he said .
" to what extent does europe identify with this country , and to what extent does turkey identify with europe ? " it 's a question many of the artists featured in simdi now have an answer to .
the message coming across as the festival unfolds is loud and clear : these young turks have no qualms about describing themselves as european . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener -lrb- second from left -rrb- after winning the eurovision song contest in 2003 sertab erener -lrb- photo -rrb- demonstrated the exportability of modern turkish culture by winning the 2003 eurovision song contest , while popstar and pin-up tarkan -lrb- photo below -rrb- recently released an album of tracks sung in english and can rest assured he 'll go down in history as the first turkish artist to land a top 10 hit in germany . turkey 's unique status while simdi now boasts an impressive line-up of acts that provide a glimpse of dynamic new developments in contemporary turkish culture , it also highlights the country 's musical and artistic traditions - albeit often spiced up with experimental elements . turkey 's unique status as a gateway between europe and asia gives the country a significance that simdi now 's organizers are acutely aware of . bildunterschrift : tarkan " many of these new projects involve an exploration of turkey 's relationship with western civilization and with the islamic world , " freudenberg said .
" what they 're doing is seeking out a new , enlightened and open-minded position . " nikki kawamura emphasized that the festival is based on the principle of cultural exchange - one which not only prompts germany to focus on turkey , but which might also inspire berlin 's turkish community to reassess what 's happening in their country of origin and perhaps rebuild a sense of kinship .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .

the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .

olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .

thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .

its report called " how green are the games " states that " green energy is the most striking failure for the athens olympics . "
" for a country that markets itself as a country of endless sunshine , solar energy for the games should n't be so difficult .
but green energy at the games is close to zero , " the greenpeace report said , adding that athens represents a step backwards from sydney 2000 , where the solar powered olympic village became the world 's largest solar suburb .
it was later sold as public housing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village is the largest solar suburb " utilization of solar energy in construction and maintenance , pvc phase out , development of car-free zones and saving of heritage sites from construction perils were key take homes from the sydney olympics .
but no attempt was made by athoc to understand or learn from experiences at sydney , " said shailendra yashwant , international campaigns director at greenpeace .
the world wildlife fund was equally critical in the run-up to the games , issuing a scorecard that failed athens organizers in almost every category .
" greece must now move forward and look at what can be done to reverse the environmental impacts the day after the games , " said demetres karavellas , the wwf 's director in greece .
wetlands protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rowing and canoeing will take place near the coastal forest one of the most controversial issues is the development of the schinias wetland and coastal forest into a venue to host the rowing and canoeing competitions .
environmental ngo 's argues that the schinias wetland is one of the few left in the region , and should be protected .
the wwf accused the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- of indifference , saying it failed to hold athoc to its environmental promises .
even the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- lamented that environmental promises for the athens olympics had " fallen short . "
the ioc has insisted that respect for the environment was a priority in preparing for the games .
" we 've worked closely with the athens organizing committee to ensure environmental protection measures were considered right from the start , " said ioc spokeswoman giselle davies .
environment-friendly features athoc has said that while it pressed contractors to include environmentally friendly features in all the sports venues , it could not force them to do so .
athoc also pointed to its green successes , which include measures such as creating more public transportation , planting a million large bushes and almost 300,000 trees , placing recycling bins at venues , and using organic pesticide against mosquitoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport is one of athens ' greener accomplishments unep is working with athoc on a series of public awareness activities such as an anti-littering campaign , so that at least visitors at the games will be reminded of the need to protect the environment .
" respect for nature was a feature of ancient greek civilization , " said unep 's executive director klaus töpfer .
" in those early games , victors were crowned with an olive wreath .
the olive wreath remains an olympic symbol to this day , a reminder of the precious link between humankind and the natural environment that we must learn to better preserve and cherish .

" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .

friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.09.2004 galileo : europe 's own constellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the galileo satellite navigation system for years , the galileo satellite navigation system was seen as a barrier to transatlantic relations .
but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america . " daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de satellite accord gives galileo the green light after three years of talks , europe and the united states finally struck a " win-win " deal on sharing their high precision satellite navigation systems , resolving a transatlantic row .

" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "

its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .

" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america .

negotiators call the release a " first success . " on thursday afternoon , the armed and masked gang of terrorists holed up in a school in the north ossetia region on the southern russian border released 26 women and children , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
but relatives of the more than 300 other hostages waited helplessly outside the school in the town of beslan as negotiations continued into the second day of the hostage crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past armed guards stationed outside the school casualty reports are varied , but according to an unnamed source from the joint-command operation for the crisis , 16 people were killed and another 13 injured after a gang of 20 masked and heavily armed men and women dressed in black burst into the courtyard of a secondary school in the town of beslan early wednesday morning , taking some 350 people hostage , including 200 school children .
the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .
saving lives main priority in his first public remarks since the hostage-taking , russian president vladimir putin pledged to do everything possible to save the lives of the those being held up in the school .
" our main task is , of course , to save the life and health of those who have been taken hostage .
all the actions of our forces , who are dealing with freeing the hostages , will be devoted to solving this task , " he said on thursday .
meanwhile , some 24 hours after the terrorists seized the school , two large explosions about 10 minutes apart rang out from the area of the cordoned-off building .
witnesses described seeing a billowing could of black smoke rising from the site , but no explanations were given .
since the hostage-taking several gunshots and minor explosions have gone off inside the school building .
threatening force the crisis began wednesday morning when hostage takers herded the children and adults into a gym and demanded to meet with the head of the local region of north ossetia and neighboring ingushetia , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
they have threatened to blow up the building if security forces move in .
some reports also said the gunmen , who had apparently mined the perimeter of the school , were demanding the release of rebels imprisoned in ingushetia following a deadly raid there in june .
a man inside the school reportedly told the new york times on wednesday that he represented the second group of salakhin riadus shakhidi , a rebel contingent believed to be headed by chechnya 's most notorious rebel commander , shamil basayev .
the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .
negotiations just beginning kazbek dzantiyev , head of the region 's interior ministry , said the hostages had threatened that " for every destroyed fighter , they will kill 50 children and for every injured fighter , 20 -lrb- children -rrb- . "
valery andreyev , head of the fsb security service in north ossetia province told reporters that officials would refrain from using force to free the hostages .
" there is no question at the moment of opting for force , " he said .
" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

russia 's ntv television reported that roshal , whose participation the militants had demanded , conveyed to the hostage-takers the promise of a safe corridor out , but the offer was allegedly refused .
after the 26 hostages were released on thursday roshal described the situation as an initial victory .
" but if you look at the broader picture , it is a drop in the ocean .
the is plenty of work ahead , " he told reporters .
the gunmen , roshal said , were still refusing requests to allow food and water into the school .
the pediatrician worried that an unsuccessful end to the crisis could plunge the region into a war between varied ethnic groups .
" i appeal to the wisdom of the ingush , ossetian and chechen peoples to avoid a war , otherwise thousands of lives will be lost . "
lack of information bildunterschrift : soldiers helped a small girl who escaped on wednesday as talks continued on and off throughout the night and into the second day of the crisis , details about who the gunmen are and what they want still remained unclear .
although suspicion falls heavily on chechen involvement , no one has claimed responsibility yet .
chechen rebel leader aslan maskhadov has denied involvement of separatists in the hostage drama .
distraught parents and relatives gathering in hundreds in the streets surrounding the school have demanded more information .
" no one tells us anything .
some people say the terrorists are chechens .
some people say they are arabs , but we do n't know , " nikolai dzaparov , husband and grandfather of two hostages complained on russian tv .

the blast , which killed ten people and left scores injured , was claimed by the same group that said it was responsible for last week 's crash of two russian planes that killed 90 people .

31 , 2004 " in essence , war has been declared on us , where the enemy is unseen and there is no front , " defense minister sergei ivanov said to reporters after the series of attacks , but before the hostage-taking put the nation even more on edge .
the hostage crisis at the school has revived painful memories of the moscow theater hostage-taking in 2002 , during which 130 people died after police used a poison gas when they stormed the building .
successful escape in addition to the 26 hostages who were released thursday , 50 children managed to escape capture after they hid in a school boiler room , itar-tass reported .
another 14 pupils managed to escape from the building afterwards , the north ossetia presidential spokesman told interfax news agency .
all entrances to north ossetia from neighboring republics have been closed , the republic 's prime minister told interfax .
we have increased security measures in all towns , " including all schools and kindergartens , he said .
putin also mobilized national security forces to protect nuclear facilities across the country .

" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

negotiators call the release a " first success . " on thursday afternoon , the armed and masked gang of terrorists holed up in a school in the north ossetia region on the southern russian border released 26 women and children , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
but relatives of the more than 300 other hostages waited helplessly outside the school in the town of beslan as negotiations continued into the second day of the hostage crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past armed guards stationed outside the school casualty reports are varied , but according to an unnamed source from the joint-command operation for the crisis , 16 people were killed and another 13 injured after a gang of 20 masked and heavily armed men and women dressed in black burst into the courtyard of a secondary school in the town of beslan early wednesday morning , taking some 350 people hostage , including 200 school children .
the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .
saving lives main priority in his first public remarks since the hostage-taking , russian president vladimir putin pledged to do everything possible to save the lives of the those being held up in the school .
" our main task is , of course , to save the life and health of those who have been taken hostage .
all the actions of our forces , who are dealing with freeing the hostages , will be devoted to solving this task , " he said on thursday .
meanwhile , some 24 hours after the terrorists seized the school , two large explosions about 10 minutes apart rang out from the area of the cordoned-off building .
witnesses described seeing a billowing could of black smoke rising from the site , but no explanations were given .
since the hostage-taking several gunshots and minor explosions have gone off inside the school building .
threatening force the crisis began wednesday morning when hostage takers herded the children and adults into a gym and demanded to meet with the head of the local region of north ossetia and neighboring ingushetia , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
they have threatened to blow up the building if security forces move in .
some reports also said the gunmen , who had apparently mined the perimeter of the school , were demanding the release of rebels imprisoned in ingushetia following a deadly raid there in june .
a man inside the school reportedly told the new york times on wednesday that he represented the second group of salakhin riadus shakhidi , a rebel contingent believed to be headed by chechnya 's most notorious rebel commander , shamil basayev .
the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .
negotiations just beginning kazbek dzantiyev , head of the region 's interior ministry , said the hostages had threatened that " for every destroyed fighter , they will kill 50 children and for every injured fighter , 20 -lrb- children -rrb- . "
valery andreyev , head of the fsb security service in north ossetia province told reporters that officials would refrain from using force to free the hostages .
" there is no question at the moment of opting for force , " he said .
" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

2002 the negotiations involve well-known pediatrician leonid roshal -lrb- photo -rrb- , who assisted hostages during the deadly siege of the moscow theater two years ago .
russia 's ntv television reported that roshal , whose participation the militants had demanded , conveyed to the hostage-takers the promise of a safe corridor out , but the offer was allegedly refused .
after the 26 hostages were released on thursday roshal described the situation as an initial victory .
" but if you look at the broader picture , it is a drop in the ocean .
the is plenty of work ahead , " he told reporters .
the gunmen , roshal said , were still refusing requests to allow food and water into the school .
the pediatrician worried that an unsuccessful end to the crisis could plunge the region into a war between varied ethnic groups .
" i appeal to the wisdom of the ingush , ossetian and chechen peoples to avoid a war , otherwise thousands of lives will be lost . "
lack of information bildunterschrift : soldiers helped a small girl who escaped on wednesday as talks continued on and off throughout the night and into the second day of the crisis , details about who the gunmen are and what they want still remained unclear .
although suspicion falls heavily on chechen involvement , no one has claimed responsibility yet .
chechen rebel leader aslan maskhadov has denied involvement of separatists in the hostage drama .
distraught parents and relatives gathering in hundreds in the streets surrounding the school have demanded more information .
" no one tells us anything .
some people say the terrorists are chechens .
some people say they are arabs , but we do n't know , " nikolai dzaparov , husband and grandfather of two hostages complained on russian tv .

spate of attacks the hostage-taking in north ossetia has rocketed terrorism to the very center of russian consciousness following a series of attacks in the last few days .
tuesday evening a car bomb exploded outside a crowded moscow subway station during rush hour .
the blast , which killed ten people and left scores injured , was claimed by the same group that said it was responsible for last week 's crash of two russian planes that killed 90 people .

31 , 2004 " in essence , war has been declared on us , where the enemy is unseen and there is no front , " defense minister sergei ivanov said to reporters after the series of attacks , but before the hostage-taking put the nation even more on edge .
the hostage crisis at the school has revived painful memories of the moscow theater hostage-taking in 2002 , during which 130 people died after police used a poison gas when they stormed the building .
successful escape in addition to the 26 hostages who were released thursday , 50 children managed to escape capture after they hid in a school boiler room , itar-tass reported .
another 14 pupils managed to escape from the building afterwards , the north ossetia presidential spokesman told interfax news agency .
all entrances to north ossetia from neighboring republics have been closed , the republic 's prime minister told interfax .
we have increased security measures in all towns , " including all schools and kindergartens , he said .
putin also mobilized national security forces to protect nuclear facilities across the country .
emergency security council meeting speaking to russian television putin said that what is happening in north ossetia is especially horrible , " not only because some of the hostages are children , but because this action can explode even a fragile balance of interconfessional and international relations in the region .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said . " these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks . " the vote was neither fair not transparent , " she said . her colleague krista sager emphasized that the greens have " a different view on the elections to the chancellor .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said . " these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks . " the vote was neither fair not transparent , " she said . her colleague krista sager emphasized that the greens have " a different view on the elections to the chancellor .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .
22 , 1947 .
friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.09.2004 galileo : europe 's own constellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the galileo satellite navigation system for years , the galileo satellite navigation system was seen as a barrier to transatlantic relations .
but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america . " daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de satellite accord gives galileo the green light after three years of talks , europe and the united states finally struck a " win-win " deal on sharing their high precision satellite navigation systems , resolving a transatlantic row .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .

" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .

but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .

" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face . while athletes from around the world strive for a gold medal , the international olympic committee is doing its best at keeping its 11 top sponsors happy .
the global corporations expect nothing less after investing a total of about € 693 million -lrb- $ 854 million -rrb- in the athens games .
the most the ioc can do is keep out the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .
what is supposed to be a fair and open field for the athletes is anything but that when sponsors come to town .
on the watch once spectators get their tickets - visa being the only credit card accepted at ticket counters - ticket rippers are doing more than just making sure everyone sits in the right section .
they 're also on the lookout for the wrong logos .
flags , shirts and bags with rival trademarks are banned .
so are flags from non-participating countries and banners larger than one square meter .
try brining a whopper into the mcdonald 's-only games and you 'll be left hungry .
in fact , no food is allowed to be brought into the olympic venues except for medical reasons - even water bottles bearing the wrong label have been prohibited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic ticket windows only accept visa but spectators should n't feel they 're the only ones under the sponsor police 's eye .
athletes and trainers face similar scrutiny .
when the supply cars that deliver goods to long-distance cyclists are n't from the olympic partner , their trademarks have to be hidden too .
only small logos from national team and individual athlete sponsors are allowed on competitor 's clothes .
ambush marketing the ioc is n't trying to make anyone 's life miserable .
it 's an effort to protect official sponsors from the ambush marketing tactics of non-sponsors attempting to get some cheap , or free , publicity .
nike is probably the most famous ambush marketer .
it tried stealing adidas ' thunder at the 1996 olympics by buying huge billboards outside the venues and even built a kiosk next to centennial olympic park in atlanta .
ioc members fear devastating consequences if such underhanded tactics pay off .
sponsors would stop paying big bucks for official name placement , and without sponsors ' money , many sporting events would never take place .
" if allowed to go unchecked , it will destroy the foundation of sport , " michael payne , director of global broadcasting for the olympics , said of ambush marketing .
but that wo n't happen anytime soon .
many sponsors have already signed contracts guaranteeing them exclusive rights for the 2012 games , wherever they 'll be held . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a copy of every national anthem is no easy job for naxos , compiling such a collection means establishing contact with national embassies , ordering current musical notation for the pieces , clarifying legal rights and then adapting the anthems for symphonic interpretation by a single orchestra .
" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 02.09.2004 gunmen release some russian hostages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screaming babies are carried to safety , while 300 more hostages await their fate camouflaged russian security agents carried babies to safety after militants holding hundreds of hostages in a besieged school release 26 women and children .
negotiators call the release a " first success . " on thursday afternoon , the armed and masked gang of terrorists holed up in a school in the north ossetia region on the southern russian border released 26 women and children , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
but relatives of the more than 300 other hostages waited helplessly outside the school in the town of beslan as negotiations continued into the second day of the hostage crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past armed guards stationed outside the school casualty reports are varied , but according to an unnamed source from the joint-command operation for the crisis , 16 people were killed and another 13 injured after a gang of 20 masked and heavily armed men and women dressed in black burst into the courtyard of a secondary school in the town of beslan early wednesday morning , taking some 350 people hostage , including 200 school children .
the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .
saving lives main priority in his first public remarks since the hostage-taking , russian president vladimir putin pledged to do everything possible to save the lives of the those being held up in the school .
" our main task is , of course , to save the life and health of those who have been taken hostage .
all the actions of our forces , who are dealing with freeing the hostages , will be devoted to solving this task , " he said on thursday .
meanwhile , some 24 hours after the terrorists seized the school , two large explosions about 10 minutes apart rang out from the area of the cordoned-off building .
witnesses described seeing a billowing could of black smoke rising from the site , but no explanations were given .
since the hostage-taking several gunshots and minor explosions have gone off inside the school building .
threatening force the crisis began wednesday morning when hostage takers herded the children and adults into a gym and demanded to meet with the head of the local region of north ossetia and neighboring ingushetia , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
they have threatened to blow up the building if security forces move in .
some reports also said the gunmen , who had apparently mined the perimeter of the school , were demanding the release of rebels imprisoned in ingushetia following a deadly raid there in june .
a man inside the school reportedly told the new york times on wednesday that he represented the second group of salakhin riadus shakhidi , a rebel contingent believed to be headed by chechnya 's most notorious rebel commander , shamil basayev .
the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .
negotiations just beginning kazbek dzantiyev , head of the region 's interior ministry , said the hostages had threatened that " for every destroyed fighter , they will kill 50 children and for every injured fighter , 20 -lrb- children -rrb- . "
valery andreyev , head of the fsb security service in north ossetia province told reporters that officials would refrain from using force to free the hostages .
" there is no question at the moment of opting for force , " he said .
" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pediatrician leonid roshal -lrb- left -rrb- and another unidentified doctor remove the body of a hostage killed inside a moscow theatre seized by armed chechens in oct .
2002 the negotiations involve well-known pediatrician leonid roshal -lrb- photo -rrb- , who assisted hostages during the deadly siege of the moscow theater two years ago .
russia 's ntv television reported that roshal , whose participation the militants had demanded , conveyed to the hostage-takers the promise of a safe corridor out , but the offer was allegedly refused .
after the 26 hostages were released on thursday roshal described the situation as an initial victory .
" but if you look at the broader picture , it is a drop in the ocean .
the is plenty of work ahead , " he told reporters .
the gunmen , roshal said , were still refusing requests to allow food and water into the school .
the pediatrician worried that an unsuccessful end to the crisis could plunge the region into a war between varied ethnic groups .
" i appeal to the wisdom of the ingush , ossetian and chechen peoples to avoid a war , otherwise thousands of lives will be lost . "
lack of information bildunterschrift : soldiers helped a small girl who escaped on wednesday as talks continued on and off throughout the night and into the second day of the crisis , details about who the gunmen are and what they want still remained unclear .
although suspicion falls heavily on chechen involvement , no one has claimed responsibility yet .
chechen rebel leader aslan maskhadov has denied involvement of separatists in the hostage drama .
distraught parents and relatives gathering in hundreds in the streets surrounding the school have demanded more information .
" no one tells us anything .

the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .

dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .

that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .

european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .

by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .
22 , 1947 .
friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .

it goes in beer and in whiskey , in soups and in salads .
it 's a quiet little crop that does n't get much attention , compared to wheat or rice or corn .
but barley has a history as fiery as any country .
it suffered invasions and battles .
but the barley resisted , and eventually it won a glorious victory .
and like any good story , there 's moral at the end .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards .

" these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said . " these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks .

its report called " how green are the games " states that " green energy is the most striking failure for the athens olympics . "
" for a country that markets itself as a country of endless sunshine , solar energy for the games should n't be so difficult .
but green energy at the games is close to zero , " the greenpeace report said , adding that athens represents a step backwards from sydney 2000 , where the solar powered olympic village became the world 's largest solar suburb .

the world wildlife fund was equally critical in the run-up to the games , issuing a scorecard that failed athens organizers in almost every category .

the wwf accused the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- of indifference , saying it failed to hold athoc to its environmental promises .
even the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- lamented that environmental promises for the athens olympics had " fallen short . "
the ioc has insisted that respect for the environment was a priority in preparing for the games .
" we 've worked closely with the athens organizing committee to ensure environmental protection measures were considered right from the start , " said ioc spokeswoman giselle davies .
environment-friendly features athoc has said that while it pressed contractors to include environmentally friendly features in all the sports venues , it could not force them to do so .
athoc also pointed to its green successes , which include measures such as creating more public transportation , planting a million large bushes and almost 300,000 trees , placing recycling bins at venues , and using organic pesticide against mosquitoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport is one of athens ' greener accomplishments unep is working with athoc on a series of public awareness activities such as an anti-littering campaign , so that at least visitors at the games will be reminded of the need to protect the environment .
" respect for nature was a feature of ancient greek civilization , " said unep 's executive director klaus töpfer .
" in those early games , victors were crowned with an olive wreath .

" for a country that markets itself as a country of endless sunshine , solar energy for the games should n't be so difficult .

" we 've worked closely with the athens organizing committee to ensure environmental protection measures were considered right from the start , " said ioc spokeswoman giselle davies .
environment-friendly features athoc has said that while it pressed contractors to include environmentally friendly features in all the sports venues , it could not force them to do so .
athoc also pointed to its green successes , which include measures such as creating more public transportation , planting a million large bushes and almost 300,000 trees , placing recycling bins at venues , and using organic pesticide against mosquitoes .

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face . while athletes from around the world strive for a gold medal , the international olympic committee is doing its best at keeping its 11 top sponsors happy .
the global corporations expect nothing less after investing a total of about € 693 million -lrb- $ 854 million -rrb- in the athens games .
the most the ioc can do is keep out the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .
what is supposed to be a fair and open field for the athletes is anything but that when sponsors come to town .
on the watch once spectators get their tickets - visa being the only credit card accepted at ticket counters - ticket rippers are doing more than just making sure everyone sits in the right section .
they 're also on the lookout for the wrong logos .
flags , shirts and bags with rival trademarks are banned .
so are flags from non-participating countries and banners larger than one square meter .
try brining a whopper into the mcdonald 's-only games and you 'll be left hungry .
in fact , no food is allowed to be brought into the olympic venues except for medical reasons - even water bottles bearing the wrong label have been prohibited .

recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .

the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .

the interest simply was n't there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home sweet home " what 's happened so far is that all the popular culture was exported , what is known to be touristic , " she told deutsche welle .
" i think maybe europe was n't curious enough to find out what was going on in turkey . " a one-sided picture that all changed when she met project manager nikki kawamura , who hails from kreuzberg , home to a large percentage of berlin 's 200,000-strong turkish community . often described as little istanbul , it 's a run-down neighbourhood populated by traditional migrant families . " the picture of daily life within the turkish community that you see in kreuzberg is very one-sided , " observes kawamura .
" i always thought there must be more to -lrb- turkish culture -rrb- than this . " its full breadth is now showcased in the trailblazing festival co-organized by the istanbul foundation for art and culture , london 's harrison parrot artists ' management and berlin 's werkstatt der kulturen . radical changes andreas freudenberg from the latter organization pointed out that turkish culture is currently undergoing radical changes . " twenty years ago you went to turkey on the look-out for exciting theater and you seldom found anything worth bringing back to germany , " he said .
" when you go these days there 's a real sense of change , you discover all sorts of young , new projects with a lot of broad appeal . " he 's quick to put turkey 's rapidly evolving identity in an international context . " it 's important to consider turkey 's relations with europe and europe 's relations with turkey , " he said .
" to what extent does europe identify with this country , and to what extent does turkey identify with europe ? " it 's a question many of the artists featured in simdi now have an answer to .

the interest simply was n't there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home sweet home " what 's happened so far is that all the popular culture was exported , what is known to be touristic , " she told deutsche welle .
" i think maybe europe was n't curious enough to find out what was going on in turkey . " a one-sided picture that all changed when she met project manager nikki kawamura , who hails from kreuzberg , home to a large percentage of berlin 's 200,000-strong turkish community . often described as little istanbul , it 's a run-down neighbourhood populated by traditional migrant families . " the picture of daily life within the turkish community that you see in kreuzberg is very one-sided , " observes kawamura .
" i always thought there must be more to -lrb- turkish culture -rrb- than this . " its full breadth is now showcased in the trailblazing festival co-organized by the istanbul foundation for art and culture , london 's harrison parrot artists ' management and berlin 's werkstatt der kulturen . radical changes andreas freudenberg from the latter organization pointed out that turkish culture is currently undergoing radical changes . " twenty years ago you went to turkey on the look-out for exciting theater and you seldom found anything worth bringing back to germany , " he said .
" when you go these days there 's a real sense of change , you discover all sorts of young , new projects with a lot of broad appeal . " he 's quick to put turkey 's rapidly evolving identity in an international context . " it 's important to consider turkey 's relations with europe and europe 's relations with turkey , " he said .
" to what extent does europe identify with this country , and to what extent does turkey identify with europe ? " it 's a question many of the artists featured in simdi now have an answer to .
the message coming across as the festival unfolds is loud and clear : these young turks have no qualms about describing themselves as european . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener -lrb- second from left -rrb- after winning the eurovision song contest in 2003 sertab erener -lrb- photo -rrb- demonstrated the exportability of modern turkish culture by winning the 2003 eurovision song contest , while popstar and pin-up tarkan -lrb- photo below -rrb- recently released an album of tracks sung in english and can rest assured he 'll go down in history as the first turkish artist to land a top 10 hit in germany . turkey 's unique status while simdi now boasts an impressive line-up of acts that provide a glimpse of dynamic new developments in contemporary turkish culture , it also highlights the country 's musical and artistic traditions - albeit often spiced up with experimental elements . turkey 's unique status as a gateway between europe and asia gives the country a significance that simdi now 's organizers are acutely aware of . bildunterschrift : tarkan " many of these new projects involve an exploration of turkey 's relationship with western civilization and with the islamic world , " freudenberg said .
" what they 're doing is seeking out a new , enlightened and open-minded position . " nikki kawamura emphasized that the festival is based on the principle of cultural exchange - one which not only prompts germany to focus on turkey , but which might also inspire berlin 's turkish community to reassess what 's happening in their country of origin and perhaps rebuild a sense of kinship .

the interest simply was n't there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home sweet home " what 's happened so far is that all the popular culture was exported , what is known to be touristic , " she told deutsche welle .
" i think maybe europe was n't curious enough to find out what was going on in turkey . " a one-sided picture that all changed when she met project manager nikki kawamura , who hails from kreuzberg , home to a large percentage of berlin 's 200,000-strong turkish community . often described as little istanbul , it 's a run-down neighbourhood populated by traditional migrant families . " the picture of daily life within the turkish community that you see in kreuzberg is very one-sided , " observes kawamura .
" i always thought there must be more to -lrb- turkish culture -rrb- than this . " its full breadth is now showcased in the trailblazing festival co-organized by the istanbul foundation for art and culture , london 's harrison parrot artists ' management and berlin 's werkstatt der kulturen . radical changes andreas freudenberg from the latter organization pointed out that turkish culture is currently undergoing radical changes . " twenty years ago you went to turkey on the look-out for exciting theater and you seldom found anything worth bringing back to germany , " he said .
" when you go these days there 's a real sense of change , you discover all sorts of young , new projects with a lot of broad appeal . " he 's quick to put turkey 's rapidly evolving identity in an international context . " it 's important to consider turkey 's relations with europe and europe 's relations with turkey , " he said .
" to what extent does europe identify with this country , and to what extent does turkey identify with europe ? " it 's a question many of the artists featured in simdi now have an answer to .
the message coming across as the festival unfolds is loud and clear : these young turks have no qualms about describing themselves as european . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener -lrb- second from left -rrb- after winning the eurovision song contest in 2003 sertab erener -lrb- photo -rrb- demonstrated the exportability of modern turkish culture by winning the 2003 eurovision song contest , while popstar and pin-up tarkan -lrb- photo below -rrb- recently released an album of tracks sung in english and can rest assured he 'll go down in history as the first turkish artist to land a top 10 hit in germany . turkey 's unique status while simdi now boasts an impressive line-up of acts that provide a glimpse of dynamic new developments in contemporary turkish culture , it also highlights the country 's musical and artistic traditions - albeit often spiced up with experimental elements . turkey 's unique status as a gateway between europe and asia gives the country a significance that simdi now 's organizers are acutely aware of . bildunterschrift : tarkan " many of these new projects involve an exploration of turkey 's relationship with western civilization and with the islamic world , " freudenberg said .
" what they 're doing is seeking out a new , enlightened and open-minded position . " nikki kawamura emphasized that the festival is based on the principle of cultural exchange - one which not only prompts germany to focus on turkey , but which might also inspire berlin 's turkish community to reassess what 's happening in their country of origin and perhaps rebuild a sense of kinship .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .

" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

in the near future , passengers flying from berlin to destinations in the united states could do so without having to transfer on the european continent before heading over the atlantic .
three years after lufthansa 's direct flight from berlin to washington was cancelled , negotiators at berlin 's schönefeld airport in the eastern part of the city are hoping to revive the non-stop connection with us airlines .
according to the daily berliner morgenpost , us airlines are interested in setting up direct flights once the planned berlin brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- goes into operation .
bbi is intended as an expanded version of the smaller schönefeld facility , which is currently not able to handle all the traffic of major inter-continental airlines .
which us air carriers are involved in the negotiations has not been revealed according to the newspaper , which quoted schönefeld 's marketing director burkhard kieker .
a decision is expected in november as to whether or not non-stop flights will be available starting in 2005 . dw-world.de new berlin airport prepares for take-off after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said . " these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks . " the vote was neither fair not transparent , " she said . her colleague krista sager emphasized that the greens have " a different view on the elections to the chancellor .

the two countries often worked closely together during the negotiations on a new european constitution , sometimes leading the battle in defence of small countries ' rights .
" we think it will be a practical tool for continuity , " helena tuuri , an adviser to the finnish premier in eu affairs told the euobserver .
a special seminar will be organized in spring to prepare the two presidencies .
austria will be at the helm from jan .

the year 2006 is set to be a difficult one for the european union with the ratification of the european constitution via referenda in a number of member states .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia .

what few people know , is that a single record label is responsible for the sound of the triumphant moment . the show is perfect .
the winner takes to the podium , receives a gold medal and watches as the national flag is raised for all to see .
it 's a proud moment , a patriotic moment .
and the tears swell up in the champion 's eyes .
for record label naxos it 's a golden moment when the olympian 's national anthem blares out of the speakers for all to hear .
the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .
political circumstances , shifting borders and independence have all left their mark on national anthems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a copy of every national anthem is no easy job for naxos , compiling such a collection means establishing contact with national embassies , ordering current musical notation for the pieces , clarifying legal rights and then adapting the anthems for symphonic interpretation by a single orchestra .
" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .

what few people know , is that a single record label is responsible for the sound of the triumphant moment . the show is perfect .
the winner takes to the podium , receives a gold medal and watches as the national flag is raised for all to see .
it 's a proud moment , a patriotic moment .
and the tears swell up in the champion 's eyes .
for record label naxos it 's a golden moment when the olympian 's national anthem blares out of the speakers for all to hear .
the international classic label founded by klaus heymann , a german-born music lover based in hong kong , is responsible for the musical accompaniment behind every winner 's ceremony .
recorded by the slovakian radio symphony orchestra under the direction of peter breiner , the collection of national anthems played at the olympics is a one-of-a-kind repertoire .
" as far as we know , it 's a unique series , " wolfgang ruso , naxos business director in germany told dpa wire service .
in january or february , the company hopes to publish a seven-cd collection with all the world 's national anthems .
the collection prepared for the olympics , is a special production not intended for the mass market , said ruso .
it 's a sort of dress rehearsal for the record label , but one tv audiences around the world can hear .
difficult production recording national anthems is a difficult and tedious process for musicians .
" it takes a lot of time and work , " ruso said .
" already several years ago we had published a series with nearly all the recognized national anthems , " he explained , adding that before long many of the songs had changed .
political circumstances , shifting borders and independence have all left their mark on national anthems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a copy of every national anthem is no easy job for naxos , compiling such a collection means establishing contact with national embassies , ordering current musical notation for the pieces , clarifying legal rights and then adapting the anthems for symphonic interpretation by a single orchestra .
" we invested quite a bit , " ruso said without giving numbers .
according to naxos ' owner klaus heymann , the business is doing well .
although 2003 was a slow year with cd sales dropping a million , 2004 is expected to bring growth of about 20 percent .
the worldwide presence the company wins throught the olympics is not intended to be used for advertisement - in fact , the record label intentionally refrains from drawing attention to its musical contribution .

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face . while athletes from around the world strive for a gold medal , the international olympic committee is doing its best at keeping its 11 top sponsors happy .
the global corporations expect nothing less after investing a total of about € 693 million -lrb- $ 854 million -rrb- in the athens games .
the most the ioc can do is keep out the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas wants to make sure no one in athens sees nike coke , kodak and adidas each invested about $ 60 million to be named official olympic sponsors and want to make sure pepsi , fuji and nike get as little exposure as possible during the two-week olympic games .
what is supposed to be a fair and open field for the athletes is anything but that when sponsors come to town .
on the watch once spectators get their tickets - visa being the only credit card accepted at ticket counters - ticket rippers are doing more than just making sure everyone sits in the right section .
they 're also on the lookout for the wrong logos .
flags , shirts and bags with rival trademarks are banned .
so are flags from non-participating countries and banners larger than one square meter .
try brining a whopper into the mcdonald 's-only games and you 'll be left hungry .
in fact , no food is allowed to be brought into the olympic venues except for medical reasons - even water bottles bearing the wrong label have been prohibited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic ticket windows only accept visa but spectators should n't feel they 're the only ones under the sponsor police 's eye .
athletes and trainers face similar scrutiny .
when the supply cars that deliver goods to long-distance cyclists are n't from the olympic partner , their trademarks have to be hidden too .
only small logos from national team and individual athlete sponsors are allowed on competitor 's clothes .
ambush marketing the ioc is n't trying to make anyone 's life miserable .
it 's an effort to protect official sponsors from the ambush marketing tactics of non-sponsors attempting to get some cheap , or free , publicity .
nike is probably the most famous ambush marketer .
it tried stealing adidas ' thunder at the 1996 olympics by buying huge billboards outside the venues and even built a kiosk next to centennial olympic park in atlanta .
ioc members fear devastating consequences if such underhanded tactics pay off .
sponsors would stop paying big bucks for official name placement , and without sponsors ' money , many sporting events would never take place .
" if allowed to go unchecked , it will destroy the foundation of sport , " michael payne , director of global broadcasting for the olympics , said of ambush marketing .
but that wo n't happen anytime soon .
many sponsors have already signed contracts guaranteeing them exclusive rights for the 2012 games , wherever they 'll be held . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .
" they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .

it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .

the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games , and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all the work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it .
" there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world .
" tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . "
but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed .
financial tragedy and triumph one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total price tag on olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in montreal are still paying for the games they hosted in 1976 however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games .
the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official olympic mascot like athene helps sell products and make money " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . "
since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens public transport got a makeover thanks to the games the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt .
" if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said .
olympian hangover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is part of the pre-game olympic phase analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsor shops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses .
" it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . "
massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most former olympic host cities simply do not need all the facilities .
even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows if the olympic stadium will be this full ever again not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics brings a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts .
in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy .
but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 02.09.2004 gunmen release some russian hostages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screaming babies are carried to safety , while 300 more hostages await their fate camouflaged russian security agents carried babies to safety after militants holding hundreds of hostages in a besieged school release 26 women and children .
negotiators call the release a " first success . " on thursday afternoon , the armed and masked gang of terrorists holed up in a school in the north ossetia region on the southern russian border released 26 women and children , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
but relatives of the more than 300 other hostages waited helplessly outside the school in the town of beslan as negotiations continued into the second day of the hostage crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past armed guards stationed outside the school casualty reports are varied , but according to an unnamed source from the joint-command operation for the crisis , 16 people were killed and another 13 injured after a gang of 20 masked and heavily armed men and women dressed in black burst into the courtyard of a secondary school in the town of beslan early wednesday morning , taking some 350 people hostage , including 200 school children .
the crisis , which occurred on the first day back to school , is the fourth terror attack to rock the shocked country in a week .
saving lives main priority in his first public remarks since the hostage-taking , russian president vladimir putin pledged to do everything possible to save the lives of the those being held up in the school .
" our main task is , of course , to save the life and health of those who have been taken hostage .
all the actions of our forces , who are dealing with freeing the hostages , will be devoted to solving this task , " he said on thursday .
meanwhile , some 24 hours after the terrorists seized the school , two large explosions about 10 minutes apart rang out from the area of the cordoned-off building .
witnesses described seeing a billowing could of black smoke rising from the site , but no explanations were given .
since the hostage-taking several gunshots and minor explosions have gone off inside the school building .
threatening force the crisis began wednesday morning when hostage takers herded the children and adults into a gym and demanded to meet with the head of the local region of north ossetia and neighboring ingushetia , russian news agency itar-tass reported .
they have threatened to blow up the building if security forces move in .
some reports also said the gunmen , who had apparently mined the perimeter of the school , were demanding the release of rebels imprisoned in ingushetia following a deadly raid there in june .
a man inside the school reportedly told the new york times on wednesday that he represented the second group of salakhin riadus shakhidi , a rebel contingent believed to be headed by chechnya 's most notorious rebel commander , shamil basayev .
the us newspaper said in its online edition that it reached the school by telephone and spoke with a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the fighters .
negotiations just beginning kazbek dzantiyev , head of the region 's interior ministry , said the hostages had threatened that " for every destroyed fighter , they will kill 50 children and for every injured fighter , 20 -lrb- children -rrb- . "
valery andreyev , head of the fsb security service in north ossetia province told reporters that officials would refrain from using force to free the hostages .
" there is no question at the moment of opting for force , " he said .
" there will be a lengthy and tense process of negotiation . "

2002 the negotiations involve well-known pediatrician leonid roshal -lrb- photo -rrb- , who assisted hostages during the deadly siege of the moscow theater two years ago .
russia 's ntv television reported that roshal , whose participation the militants had demanded , conveyed to the hostage-takers the promise of a safe corridor out , but the offer was allegedly refused .
after the 26 hostages were released on thursday roshal described the situation as an initial victory .
" but if you look at the broader picture , it is a drop in the ocean .
the is plenty of work ahead , " he told reporters .
the gunmen , roshal said , were still refusing requests to allow food and water into the school .
the pediatrician worried that an unsuccessful end to the crisis could plunge the region into a war between varied ethnic groups .
" i appeal to the wisdom of the ingush , ossetian and chechen peoples to avoid a war , otherwise thousands of lives will be lost . "
lack of information bildunterschrift : soldiers helped a small girl who escaped on wednesday as talks continued on and off throughout the night and into the second day of the crisis , details about who the gunmen are and what they want still remained unclear .
although suspicion falls heavily on chechen involvement , no one has claimed responsibility yet .
chechen rebel leader aslan maskhadov has denied involvement of separatists in the hostage drama .
distraught parents and relatives gathering in hundreds in the streets surrounding the school have demanded more information .
" no one tells us anything .
some people say the terrorists are chechens .
some people say they are arabs , but we do n't know , " nikolai dzaparov , husband and grandfather of two hostages complained on russian tv .

the blast , which killed ten people and left scores injured , was claimed by the same group that said it was responsible for last week 's crash of two russian planes that killed 90 people .

the hostage crisis at the school has revived painful memories of the moscow theater hostage-taking in 2002 , during which 130 people died after police used a poison gas when they stormed the building .
successful escape in addition to the 26 hostages who were released thursday , 50 children managed to escape capture after they hid in a school boiler room , itar-tass reported .

president putin , who broke off travel plans to turkey called for an emergency meeting of the un security council following the hostage-taking .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .

friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.09.2004 galileo : europe 's own constellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the galileo satellite navigation system for years , the galileo satellite navigation system was seen as a barrier to transatlantic relations .
but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america . " daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de satellite accord gives galileo the green light after three years of talks , europe and the united states finally struck a " win-win " deal on sharing their high precision satellite navigation systems , resolving a transatlantic row .

but the european union 's most-ambitious space project is now seen as a competitor and complement to gps . after its completion around 2009 , europe 's galileo navigation system will guide trucks carrying goods across european highways , it will help land planes at europe 's crowded airports , it will assist ships docking in its busy ports , and it will aid the blind in finding their way through city streets .
but to many europeans , the most important thing about galileo is that it will wean the eu of its technological dependence on the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
europeans have long complained that gps is unreliable for critical use because , as a military system , it can and has been scrambled during times of crisis .
" it 's always better to be the master of your future , " jean claude gayssot , the former transport minister of france said when the eu approved the project in 2002 .
" if you are not the owner of your own system , how can you be sure that every decision is going to be taken in your interest ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is great and it 's free , but you ca n't always rely on the pentagon to give you accurate data .
dominique detain of the european space agency , which has been responsible for the initial development and testing of galileo , says europe needs its own navigation system because gps is n't reliable enough .
" you 're never sure of the data or the signal you get from gps , " he told dw-world .
" you ca n't be certain of the continuity of the signal and that you will be made aware of a disruption to the signal .
and that 's not because it 's not possible , but because the military does not want to provide such information . "
that lack of reliability has made gps unfeasible for applications where a slight inaccuracy could result in deaths , like air traffic control .
" with galileo , we will provide all of the information and we will assure that it is valid , " he said .
european critics of gps often point out that the pentagon scrambled its signal at times during the war in kosovo , disrupting service to civilian users .
a global service industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a galileo satellite europe 's biggest infrastructure project ever , galileo is currently being planned by the european space agency and the firm galileo industries , a germany-based consortium that includes european space industry giants like eads , alcatel and alenia spazio .
by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .
but washington and brussels reached a deal in june that will make the two systems compatible and interoperable while at the same time maintaining autonomy over each system , effectively eliminating any remaining conflict over the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio " with this agreement , we are going to set the rules of the game for the gps and galileo for the coming decades , both systems being fully interoperable , and they will set the world standards in the market through the use of the same open signal , " european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio -lrb- photo -rrb- of spain said in june .
" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .
" gps is the world standard and provides us a measure of space control and dominance unmatched .
to cede this could be tragic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has eyed china 's space ambitions suspiciously .
its growing cooperation with europe is also raising eyebrows .
in other words : the fears in the us were n't just that there would be technical overlap with the gps signal - old fashion competition also plays a role .
" there was concern europe was going to build a system that effectively turned gps into betamax , " joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island , explained in an interview with dw-world .
she added that the participation of the chinese , who are investing in galileo , also sparked discomfort in washington .
" the us and china view space as a zero some , " she explained , " any gain by one is a loss for the other .
the fact that europe is working with china on galileo makes the perception of it even more threatening to the united states . "
coming to a receiver near you the first galileo test satellites are expected to be launched in autumn 2005 , with remaining satellites being launched by 2009 .
european space industry giants are currently bidding for the right to the concession to operate galileo after it has been launched .
esa 's detain says galileo should be seen not only as a service for europe , but also one for the rest of the world .
" the galileo satellites wo n't stop working once they 've passed the european borders .
it will be a global system , " he said .
" gps is a great system , but some information is n't provided - the data gets upgraded and downgraded and you 're never sure of it .
europe could n't develop activities on a system where it is unsure of the source , so it 's very important strategically to have an independent system .
now that galileo and gps are going to be interoperable , this will benefit everyone , even america .

by the time operations of the 30-satellite constellation begins , the eu will have invested approximately € 3.4 billion on the ambitious project .
but the payoff could be even greater .
european commissioner for transportation loyola de palacio has estimated galileo will create a global services industry with more than 150,000 new jobs and € 10 billion in annual revenues gained from premium versions of the galileo signal .
the eu will also derive revenues from a licensing fee paid by manufacturers of galileo receivers .
galileo will provide europe 's first competition to the global positioning system of satellites launched by the us in 1973 and operated by the pentagon .
cutting a deal with washington for a number of years , galileo served as a serious thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
officials in washington feared the spectrum used by galileo could interfere with the gps signal used by the military , making it difficult for the americans to scramble the signal in times of crisis .
others in the us argued that satellite navigation systems should be available for free , like gps , and there was no need for a commercial version .

" this will allow all users to use in a complementary way both systems with the same receiver . "
she said the cooperation would also benefit the european and american space industries , which are already highly interwoven .
the bush administration also extended its support for the deal .
" the agreement manages to balance the competition that is inherent in the commercial dimension of satellite navigational technology with the cooperation necessary for the security dimension , " secretary of state colin powell said .
the diplomat said the existence of redundant systems would also " ensure the safety and availability of satellite navigation technology for transportation and recreational users worldwide . "
critics still lurking still , some in washington are adamantly opposed to galileo , which they see as a threat to us space dominance .
speaking at a recent space conference , republican congressman dave weldon encouraged the us to expedite its own plans for a next-generation gps in order to beat the europeans at galileo .
" i am concerned that while we fail to deploy gps-3 , the european / chinese efforts for galileo will be encouraged and they will field a competing system , " he said .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution . " back in berlin , he justified his statement in a television interview by citing diplomatic sensitivity and pointing to the recent wave of terrorist violence in russia . " it should not be forgotten that the russian people recently suffered terrorist attacks on civilian airlines … -lrb- the country -rrb- has repeatedly been the target of terrorist activity , " schröder said . double standards his comments unleashed a storm of protest , with opposition leader angela merkel accusing the chancellor of double standards . " it is unacceptable that the chancellor is unable to tell russia in no uncertain terms that the elections in chechnya were irregular , and that the republic has a bad track record when it comes to press freedom and human rights , " she said . " these things need to be discussed , even among allies , " she added , referring to the solid political friendship between the two leaders . even claudia roth from the green party , head of the government body for human rights , disagreed with schröder 's analysis . " this was not a democratic election , " she said .
" the chancellor gave his view , but there are clear indications that there is a different version of events . " green party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt echoed her remarks . " the vote was neither fair not transparent , " she said . her colleague krista sager emphasized that the greens have " a different view on the elections to the chancellor .

chancellor gerhard schröder has drawn widespread criticism for stating that sunday 's presidential elections in chechnya were fair and democratic . during tuesday 's summit in sotchi on the black sea with russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac , schröder expressed his support for putin 's efforts to reach a political solution to the ongoing separatist crisis in the breakaway russian republic and explicitly avoided addressing the thorny issues of vote rigging and lack of voter turn-out in the recent poll . the vote saw kremlin-backed candidate alu alkhanov win by a landslide . observers say the odds were stacked against his rival candidates . although the european commission has stated it is not satisfied with the vote and called for early parliamentary polls , schröder insisted the elections " prove that russia wants a political solution .

" that along with around 2,500 further works of modern art ranging from duchamp and mondrian to contemporary pieces by jason rohoades and paul mccarthy are scheduled to go on display on september 22 for seven years . " i 'm thrilled , it 's better than i could have ever imagined even in my wildest dreams , " said flick during the presentation of the art works , in a reference to the architecture of the massive exhibition hall .
its restoration was financed by flick through € 8 million .
" i 've never seen my collection in such a big context before , " he added .
" we 're showing contemporary and provocative art . " christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture , spoke on tuesday of an " art historical sensation " and a " unique collection with uncomfortable works of world class . "
weiss added she hoped the collection could find a permanent home in berlin and fill in a crucial gap in contemporary art in the city 's rich museum landscape . show sullied by " blood money " but the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of the vast exhibition could n't conceal the controversy that has dogged it and its owner for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg war crimes tribunal on dec .
22 , 1947 .
friedrich flick was accused of employing forced labor and of usurpation of factories in the german-occupied territories .
he was sentenced to 7 years of prison .
the grandson of friedrich flick -lrb- 1883-1972 -rrb- , one of the chief arms manufacturers of the nazis who was found guilty of using forced labor and who refused paying compensation , flick has for years been accused of financing the expensive collection with the massive wealth left to him by his grandfather . jewish groups in germany have said the collection is stained by " blood money . " in an open letter to flick published in a german daily earlier this year , michael fürst , a member of the central council of jews , said the exhibition equated an " unbearable provocation for all those who had to suffer hunger , humiliation and torture as forced laborers and concentration camp inmates in your grandfather 's factories . " fürst also slammed berlin authorities for organizing the exhibition and said he was shocked " by the lack of sensitivity among berlin 's cultural officials , who had apparently been blinded and made forgetful by the glamour of big money and the gigantic range of the collection . " flick , himself a millionaire , has also come under fire for failing to pay into a reparation fund set up by german industry to compensate those forced into labor camps by the nazis . family feud this week the controversy took another twist with flick 's sister dagmar ottmann distancing herself publicly from the exhibition and demanding that the family history first be researched by historians .
flick 's brother , gert-rudolf flick protested against the marketing of the " flick " name and slammed the planned display . flick has dismissed the criticism , saying " it 's natural that there are different views within a family , even on important issues . " flick stresses amends for pasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dieter lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- , president of the prussian cultural foundation and flick sit on an art object by franz west in the future exhibition hall the millionaire art collector has admitted that " the family name flick comes with a special responsibility , " but insists that the display of his collection is not intended to " relativize or make people forget " the crimes of his grandfather . this week flick pointed to his efforts to make amends for the past .
" three years ago i set up a foundation for tolerance with ten million euros that supports around 45 projects , particularly for teenagers , " he said .
" the facts speak for themselves . " a berlin television station also reported this week that flick had also provided funds to help modernize a synagogue in berlin and his " tolerance foundation " was also named in the list of promoters for the 70th anniversary issue of the new york-based german-jewish magazine aufbau . show should be free of ideology this week flick stressed he was open to discussion about his controversial past , but warned it should n't be carried over to the artists represented in the exhibition .
" the exhibition should not be abused by viewing it through ideologically-tinted glasses , " he said . flick has been backed by weiss , who pointed to the detailed program accompanying the berlin exhibition , which focuses on the nazi past .
" art ca n't be held liable for the actions of the family , " said weiss . at the same time , she said it was clear that german society " still had n't come to grips with guilt and responsibility , " adding , " no debate will be stifled .
