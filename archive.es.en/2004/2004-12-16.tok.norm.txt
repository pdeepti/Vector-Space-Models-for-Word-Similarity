program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2004 opinion : presidential plain language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- right -rrb- and african union chair alpha oumar konaré during his 10-day trip to africa that ends thursday , german president horst köhler lobbied for the southern continent while also criticizing shortcomings .
dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

but now that they 've won , it 's time to be sensible , say german lotto authorities . just in time for a pre-holiday spending spree , two winners from the german state of north rhine-westphalia came forward to claim germany 's largest ever lotto jackpot on wednesday .
they will split a record € 26.7 -lrb- $ 34.8 -rrb- million between them . however , their identity will not be revealed to the general public immediately , lotto authorities announced on thursday .
they are giving them some time to consider their new-found fortunes with family and friends - just in case new " fast friends " crawl out of the woodwork to claim a spot on the new winners christmas list . there 's gold in them there hills in the weeks leading-up to wednesday night 's drawing , as the jackpot grew , lotto fever gripped the country .
according to horst mentrup , the director of the brandenburg lotto gmbh , many people bought lotto tickets for the first time and some living in neighboring countries crossed the border to buy tickets . he likened it to a " goldrush feeling " at a press conference in potsdam on thursday . we 're rich , now let 's be sensible but despite the hysteria leading up to the drawing , it did n't take long for good old-fashioned german sensibility to set in .
lotto authorities said they would not give further details about the winner 's identity , claiming they were giving the two winners time to consider - in peace - their plans for the future . " they should now have the opportunity to consider - with their closest friends and family - what they want to do with their winnings , " said mentrup .
" with a jackpot like this , the number of false friends can grow expotentially . " in addition , lotto authorities offered , in keeping with custom , the winners the services of a bank 's financial consultants , who will advise them on possible investments and savings options .
" based on our experience , it does n't take long for the winners to come back down to earth and get down to business , " said mentrup . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lotto con cheats players out of millions in one of the biggest scandals to surface since the lottery was introduced in germany , a german firm has been accused of cheating thousands of players out of millions of euros .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .

" any proposition aimed at not including specific categories of expenditure is not proper , " the director general for economic and financial affairs in brussels , klaus regling , told the financial times deutschland in an interview . regling , who answers directly to the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said that if such proposals were adopted , it would mean that countries could put on a show of getting their finances in order , while effectively being allowed to continue to build up deficits .
" that would be diametrically opposed to the aim of the stability pact , which is to prevent a member state from becoming over-indebted , " regling said . in the debate over a reform of the stability pact , which limits euro-zone members ' deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , germany has suggested that a country 's net contribution to the eu not be included in the calculation of the deficit . dw-world.de shared responsibility for stability pact germany 's obligations under the stability pact , the rules governing the euro , are to be included in its constitution , following an agreement made on sunday .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom .

" we will fight to keep all our factories and our research activities in the industrial park at hoechst , near frankfurt , but only if we 're treated properly , " dehecq told the german monthly manager magazin in an interview published on the magazine 's web site . dehecq slammed recent german healthcare reforms in which prices for new , innovative patented drugs were pegged to the prices of off-patent generic drugs " the consequence is that prices of generic drugs rise , even though their makers do not put any money into research , while prices for research-intensive innovative medicines fall .
that 's a disaster , " dehecq said .
asked what that meant for sanofi-aventis , the chairman replied : " quite simply , we wo n't invest long term in a country where we do n't earn any money . "
but dehecq sought to calm those fears , pledging no compulsory redundancies until the end of 2007 . dw-world.de mending the franco-german industrial rift french finance minister nicolas sarkozy meets with counterpart wolfgang clement in berlin on monday in an attempt to heal the recent rifts in franco-german industrial relations with plans for a shipbuilding alliance .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?

but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

" any proposition aimed at not including specific categories of expenditure is not proper , " the director general for economic and financial affairs in brussels , klaus regling , told the financial times deutschland in an interview . regling , who answers directly to the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , joaquin almunia , said that if such proposals were adopted , it would mean that countries could put on a show of getting their finances in order , while effectively being allowed to continue to build up deficits .
" that would be diametrically opposed to the aim of the stability pact , which is to prevent a member state from becoming over-indebted , " regling said . in the debate over a reform of the stability pact , which limits euro-zone members ' deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , germany has suggested that a country 's net contribution to the eu not be included in the calculation of the deficit . dw-world.de shared responsibility for stability pact germany 's obligations under the stability pact , the rules governing the euro , are to be included in its constitution , following an agreement made on sunday .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .

finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .

evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2004 opinion : presidential plain language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- right -rrb- and african union chair alpha oumar konaré during his 10-day trip to africa that ends thursday , german president horst köhler lobbied for the southern continent while also criticizing shortcomings .
dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we like to be entertained inside plastic balls , so why should n't mice ?
many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .
not just for behavioral research strictly speaking , the results of würbel 's experiments apply only to behavioral research . but würbel says they should be just as relevant in other branches of lab research . " they should also apply to animals ' physiology or anatomy , which are , in any case , less sensitive than behavior to environmental perturbations , " he said .

dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state . " turkey says its membership in the eu will bring economic and cultural advantages to the 25 nation bloc . it has 10 to 15 years to convince the eu of that . anita purcell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's dossier on turkey 's eu membership bid .

on thursday night , their optimism was tempered by reminders of the challenges ahead . after a 40-year wait , turks looked forward to a likely green light to finally start talks to join the european union .
but their enthusiasm was tempered by a sense of resentment and fears that they are unwelcome neighbors knocking at europe 's door . throughout the day , television channels played beethoven 's " ode to joy " and , minute by minute , covered developments at the eu summit in brussels , where hard bargaining on the terms under which turkey will be invited to accession talks will likely continue until a decision is announced on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said yes to turkey on wednesday " the longest night , " headlined the conservative yeni safak newspaper , while the large-circulation sabah dedicated its entire front page to a photo of members of the european parliament voting in favor of turkey 's accession at their session wednesday in strasbourg . final appeals made in an 11th-hour media blitz , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan made an emotional appeal to explain turkey 's case in an " open letter to my european friends , " published simultaneously in turkey and germany , which has a large turkish immigrant community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soldiers already serve in nato missions " my people , who yesterday - within the nato framework - sent their children to risk death and fight shoulder to shoulder alongside the children of europe for the principles of freedom and democracy , today aspire to live under the same roof as their european friends for the same principles of freedom and democracy , " he wrote . public mood cautious around 75 percent of the turkish population backs eu membership , according to opinion polls , but the mood in the street on thursday night was low-key , as the tough conditions the union is expected to impose on turkey cooled any sense of celebration . the only major pro-eu demonstration in the run-up to the brussels summit took place last week in diyarbakir , in the mainly kurdish southeast .
the urban west , where the country 's eu bid enjoys robust support , awaited the decision in silent anticipation . still unwelcome neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have read harsh rhetoric in the papers the sometimes harsh rhetoric turkey 's opponents used in the europe-wide debate preceding the brussels summit made on impression on the overwhelmingly muslim nation , which has long admired europe and seen it as a role model . " the europeans do not like us because their heads are full of historic prejudices , " said retiree ali riza midilli .
" they will admit us , but very grudgingly .
they want to extract many concessions from us .
our leaders should be very careful . " for cemil kurt , a 28-year-old worker at the ankara municipality , her country 's predominately muslim religion was the " main reason " for european scepticism . " still , i believe that we should join , because unemployment will decrease and the price of many things will go down , " he said , echoing the hope of economic prosperity that many turks have pinned on future eu membership . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .

according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .

according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

on thursday night , their optimism was tempered by reminders of the challenges ahead . after a 40-year wait , turks looked forward to a likely green light to finally start talks to join the european union .
but their enthusiasm was tempered by a sense of resentment and fears that they are unwelcome neighbors knocking at europe 's door . throughout the day , television channels played beethoven 's " ode to joy " and , minute by minute , covered developments at the eu summit in brussels , where hard bargaining on the terms under which turkey will be invited to accession talks will likely continue until a decision is announced on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said yes to turkey on wednesday " the longest night , " headlined the conservative yeni safak newspaper , while the large-circulation sabah dedicated its entire front page to a photo of members of the european parliament voting in favor of turkey 's accession at their session wednesday in strasbourg . final appeals made in an 11th-hour media blitz , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan made an emotional appeal to explain turkey 's case in an " open letter to my european friends , " published simultaneously in turkey and germany , which has a large turkish immigrant community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soldiers already serve in nato missions " my people , who yesterday - within the nato framework - sent their children to risk death and fight shoulder to shoulder alongside the children of europe for the principles of freedom and democracy , today aspire to live under the same roof as their european friends for the same principles of freedom and democracy , " he wrote . public mood cautious around 75 percent of the turkish population backs eu membership , according to opinion polls , but the mood in the street on thursday night was low-key , as the tough conditions the union is expected to impose on turkey cooled any sense of celebration . the only major pro-eu demonstration in the run-up to the brussels summit took place last week in diyarbakir , in the mainly kurdish southeast .
the urban west , where the country 's eu bid enjoys robust support , awaited the decision in silent anticipation . still unwelcome neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have read harsh rhetoric in the papers the sometimes harsh rhetoric turkey 's opponents used in the europe-wide debate preceding the brussels summit made on impression on the overwhelmingly muslim nation , which has long admired europe and seen it as a role model . " the europeans do not like us because their heads are full of historic prejudices , " said retiree ali riza midilli .
" they will admit us , but very grudgingly .
they want to extract many concessions from us .
our leaders should be very careful . " for cemil kurt , a 28-year-old worker at the ankara municipality , her country 's predominately muslim religion was the " main reason " for european scepticism . " still , i believe that we should join , because unemployment will decrease and the price of many things will go down , " he said , echoing the hope of economic prosperity that many turks have pinned on future eu membership . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2004 german churches criticize arms exports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers like german made leopard 2 tanks in 2003 germany quadrupled its weapons sales abroad to € 1.3 billion and set a new record .
the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .

dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .

the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we like to be entertained inside plastic balls , so why should n't mice ?
many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .
not just for behavioral research strictly speaking , the results of würbel 's experiments apply only to behavioral research . but würbel says they should be just as relevant in other branches of lab research . " they should also apply to animals ' physiology or anatomy , which are , in any case , less sensitive than behavior to environmental perturbations , " he said .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state . " turkey says its membership in the eu will bring economic and cultural advantages to the 25 nation bloc . it has 10 to 15 years to convince the eu of that . anita purcell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's dossier on turkey 's eu membership bid .

many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .

the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .

according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .

she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we like to be entertained inside plastic balls , so why should n't mice ?
many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .
not just for behavioral research strictly speaking , the results of würbel 's experiments apply only to behavioral research . but würbel says they should be just as relevant in other branches of lab research . " they should also apply to animals ' physiology or anatomy , which are , in any case , less sensitive than behavior to environmental perturbations , " he said .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state . " turkey says its membership in the eu will bring economic and cultural advantages to the 25 nation bloc . it has 10 to 15 years to convince the eu of that . anita purcell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's dossier on turkey 's eu membership bid .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .
lufthansa flight attendant herwig schober returned from a recent trip to new york city with more than just his own luggage . “ i picked up three bath towels for a friend and cosmetics and cologne , ” he said .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .
lufthansa flight attendant herwig schober returned from a recent trip to new york city with more than just his own luggage . “ i picked up three bath towels for a friend and cosmetics and cologne , ” he said .
“ at the moment , there are finally positive effects of going over there again . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moaning and groaning germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2004 german churches criticize arms exports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers like german made leopard 2 tanks in 2003 germany quadrupled its weapons sales abroad to € 1.3 billion and set a new record .
the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers .

" cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state . " turkey says its membership in the eu will bring economic and cultural advantages to the 25 nation bloc . it has 10 to 15 years to convince the eu of that . anita purcell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's dossier on turkey 's eu membership bid .

dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .

germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .

for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”

dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .

the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .

bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .

because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .

police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2004 opinion : presidential plain language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- right -rrb- and african union chair alpha oumar konaré during his 10-day trip to africa that ends thursday , german president horst köhler lobbied for the southern continent while also criticizing shortcomings .
dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we like to be entertained inside plastic balls , so why should n't mice ?
many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .
not just for behavioral research strictly speaking , the results of würbel 's experiments apply only to behavioral research . but würbel says they should be just as relevant in other branches of lab research . " they should also apply to animals ' physiology or anatomy , which are , in any case , less sensitive than behavior to environmental perturbations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2004 german churches criticize arms exports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers like german made leopard 2 tanks in 2003 germany quadrupled its weapons sales abroad to € 1.3 billion and set a new record .
the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we like to be entertained inside plastic balls , so why should n't mice ?
many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .
not just for behavioral research strictly speaking , the results of würbel 's experiments apply only to behavioral research . but würbel says they should be just as relevant in other branches of lab research . " they should also apply to animals ' physiology or anatomy , which are , in any case , less sensitive than behavior to environmental perturbations , " he said .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .

germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state . " turkey says its membership in the eu will bring economic and cultural advantages to the 25 nation bloc . it has 10 to 15 years to convince the eu of that . anita purcell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's dossier on turkey 's eu membership bid .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2004 german churches criticize arms exports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers like german made leopard 2 tanks in 2003 germany quadrupled its weapons sales abroad to € 1.3 billion and set a new record .
the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2004 german churches criticize arms exports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers like german made leopard 2 tanks in 2003 germany quadrupled its weapons sales abroad to € 1.3 billion and set a new record .
the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers .

on thursday night , their optimism was tempered by reminders of the challenges ahead . after a 40-year wait , turks looked forward to a likely green light to finally start talks to join the european union .
but their enthusiasm was tempered by a sense of resentment and fears that they are unwelcome neighbors knocking at europe 's door . throughout the day , television channels played beethoven 's " ode to joy " and , minute by minute , covered developments at the eu summit in brussels , where hard bargaining on the terms under which turkey will be invited to accession talks will likely continue until a decision is announced on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said yes to turkey on wednesday " the longest night , " headlined the conservative yeni safak newspaper , while the large-circulation sabah dedicated its entire front page to a photo of members of the european parliament voting in favor of turkey 's accession at their session wednesday in strasbourg . final appeals made in an 11th-hour media blitz , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan made an emotional appeal to explain turkey 's case in an " open letter to my european friends , " published simultaneously in turkey and germany , which has a large turkish immigrant community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soldiers already serve in nato missions " my people , who yesterday - within the nato framework - sent their children to risk death and fight shoulder to shoulder alongside the children of europe for the principles of freedom and democracy , today aspire to live under the same roof as their european friends for the same principles of freedom and democracy , " he wrote . public mood cautious around 75 percent of the turkish population backs eu membership , according to opinion polls , but the mood in the street on thursday night was low-key , as the tough conditions the union is expected to impose on turkey cooled any sense of celebration . the only major pro-eu demonstration in the run-up to the brussels summit took place last week in diyarbakir , in the mainly kurdish southeast .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .

police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .

police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state .

" cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state . " turkey says its membership in the eu will bring economic and cultural advantages to the 25 nation bloc . it has 10 to 15 years to convince the eu of that . anita purcell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's dossier on turkey 's eu membership bid .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .

on thursday night , their optimism was tempered by reminders of the challenges ahead . after a 40-year wait , turks looked forward to a likely green light to finally start talks to join the european union .
but their enthusiasm was tempered by a sense of resentment and fears that they are unwelcome neighbors knocking at europe 's door . throughout the day , television channels played beethoven 's " ode to joy " and , minute by minute , covered developments at the eu summit in brussels , where hard bargaining on the terms under which turkey will be invited to accession talks will likely continue until a decision is announced on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said yes to turkey on wednesday " the longest night , " headlined the conservative yeni safak newspaper , while the large-circulation sabah dedicated its entire front page to a photo of members of the european parliament voting in favor of turkey 's accession at their session wednesday in strasbourg . final appeals made in an 11th-hour media blitz , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan made an emotional appeal to explain turkey 's case in an " open letter to my european friends , " published simultaneously in turkey and germany , which has a large turkish immigrant community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soldiers already serve in nato missions " my people , who yesterday - within the nato framework - sent their children to risk death and fight shoulder to shoulder alongside the children of europe for the principles of freedom and democracy , today aspire to live under the same roof as their european friends for the same principles of freedom and democracy , " he wrote . public mood cautious around 75 percent of the turkish population backs eu membership , according to opinion polls , but the mood in the street on thursday night was low-key , as the tough conditions the union is expected to impose on turkey cooled any sense of celebration . the only major pro-eu demonstration in the run-up to the brussels summit took place last week in diyarbakir , in the mainly kurdish southeast .
the urban west , where the country 's eu bid enjoys robust support , awaited the decision in silent anticipation . still unwelcome neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have read harsh rhetoric in the papers the sometimes harsh rhetoric turkey 's opponents used in the europe-wide debate preceding the brussels summit made on impression on the overwhelmingly muslim nation , which has long admired europe and seen it as a role model . " the europeans do not like us because their heads are full of historic prejudices , " said retiree ali riza midilli .
" they will admit us , but very grudgingly .
they want to extract many concessions from us .
our leaders should be very careful . " for cemil kurt , a 28-year-old worker at the ankara municipality , her country 's predominately muslim religion was the " main reason " for european scepticism . " still , i believe that we should join , because unemployment will decrease and the price of many things will go down , " he said , echoing the hope of economic prosperity that many turks have pinned on future eu membership . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .

but now that they 've won , it 's time to be sensible , say german lotto authorities . just in time for a pre-holiday spending spree , two winners from the german state of north rhine-westphalia came forward to claim germany 's largest ever lotto jackpot on wednesday .
they will split a record € 26.7 -lrb- $ 34.8 -rrb- million between them . however , their identity will not be revealed to the general public immediately , lotto authorities announced on thursday .
they are giving them some time to consider their new-found fortunes with family and friends - just in case new " fast friends " crawl out of the woodwork to claim a spot on the new winners christmas list . there 's gold in them there hills in the weeks leading-up to wednesday night 's drawing , as the jackpot grew , lotto fever gripped the country .
according to horst mentrup , the director of the brandenburg lotto gmbh , many people bought lotto tickets for the first time and some living in neighboring countries crossed the border to buy tickets . he likened it to a " goldrush feeling " at a press conference in potsdam on thursday . we 're rich , now let 's be sensible but despite the hysteria leading up to the drawing , it did n't take long for good old-fashioned german sensibility to set in .
lotto authorities said they would not give further details about the winner 's identity , claiming they were giving the two winners time to consider - in peace - their plans for the future . " they should now have the opportunity to consider - with their closest friends and family - what they want to do with their winnings , " said mentrup .
" with a jackpot like this , the number of false friends can grow expotentially . " in addition , lotto authorities offered , in keeping with custom , the winners the services of a bank 's financial consultants , who will advise them on possible investments and savings options .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .

finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .

for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .
lufthansa flight attendant herwig schober returned from a recent trip to new york city with more than just his own luggage . “ i picked up three bath towels for a friend and cosmetics and cologne , ” he said .
“ at the moment , there are finally positive effects of going over there again . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moaning and groaning germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday . in october , the european commission recommended that the eu begin membership talks with turkey after assessing ankara ’ s political and economic reforms to meet eu membership requirements . according to the eu ’ s so-called copenhagen criteria , candidate countries must have or be working towards stable institutions responsible for human rights , justice and democracy . they must also have an economy able to cope with competitive market forces within the eu and adhere to eu aims of political , economic and monetary union . in an effort to bolster its chances of entering the now 25-member bloc , turkey has introduced a raft of economic and political reforms coinciding with the membership criteria . amanda akacakoca , an analyst with the european policy institute in brussels , said accession talks are expected to last 10 years - but already turkey is worried about the eu shifting its goal posts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkish republic of northern cyprus forever , " reads the sign on the roof at the border crossing on the island " the key things that are worrying turkey are the things relating to the recognition of cyprus , additional clauses that have been attached and usual fears over migration of labor – trying to put a permanent cap on it , " she said .
" turkey perceives some of these things as being new pre-conditions . " cyprus a central issue the eu is demanding that turkey tacitly recognize the greek half of divided cyprus before accession talks begin , but ankara is refusing to do so , saying this is not part of the copenhagen criteria and that it is a matter for the un . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island in response to a coup by the then ruling military junta in greece . the greek-cypriot part of cyprus joined the eu on may 1 after it rejected a un plan to reunify the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of turkey , right , and the breakaway turkish cypriot state , center , fly behind a statue of a turkish soldier in the turkish capital of ankara turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared government of the turkish-cypriots in the island ’ s north . over the last few weeks , cyprus has played a game of hot and cold over whether it was going to veto turkey ’ s membership bid . akacakoca said cypriot leaders are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship to force ankara ’ s hand . " cyprus still has the shadow of the annan plan hanging over him , " she said , referring to a peace plan drawn up by un secretary general kofi annan .
" from turkey ’ s point of view , they did everything possible to bring about a ' yes ' from the turkish cypriots so they believe that it is very unfair for them to be asked to recognize the republic of cyprus beforehand . “ " plan b " turkey has the support of germany and france , but french president jacques chirac , faced with domestic opposition over turkish accession , suggested the possible need for a “ plan b ” for ankara if talks failed . austria and denmark proposed a “ privileged partnership ” arguing that the eu would not be able to absorb turkey ’ s growing population , which is now at 70 million . analysts say by the time it joins , turkey would be the most populous nation in the eu thereby giving it the most voting power within the population-based voting system under the bloc ’ s constitution . turkey has dismissed suggestions for a " plan b , " saying that talks should lead to full membership , not second class status . latest opinion polls showed the majority of europeans , particularly from the original 15 member states are against turkey joining the eu .
the majority of resistance comes from austria , germany , luxembourg , finland , the netherlands and france . " old europe " has problems akacakoca said those living in “ old europe ” have a problem with turkey ’ s asian and non-christian heritage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ottoman era blue mosque in istanbul 's historic sultanahmet district at sunset on wednesday “ i think it 's just something that ’ s been talked about a lot to put greater fears into public opinion , " she said .
" if you look back at the previous enlargement of 10 countries , people weren ’ t asked what their opinion was , it wasn ’ t a big issue .
it ’ s only become an issue because of turkey being a muslim state .

dw 's ute schaeffer accompanied him and reviewed the visit . just before the end of his first journey to africa as german president , köhler made the case for greater african involvement in international institutions during a speech before the african union in ethiopia 's capital addis ababa . in the same speech , however , the former head of the international monetary fund also pointed to serious problems faced by many african states and denounced those profiting from armed conflicts . köhler is convinced that it 's important to use plain language in africa and he certainly did during his trip , which also took him to sierra leone , benin and djibouti . some diplomats might have been petrified with horror when köhler reminded benin 's president mathieu kerekou of the upcoming anti-corruption day and added that the latter 's country still had a lot to do to combat corruption .
and during a meeting with tribal chiefs , the german president talked about the continuing practice of mutilating female genitalia . wars and failed reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german first lady eva köhler during a visit to a refugee camp in sierra leone wherever he went , köhler talked straight and issued concrete political demands : africans should stop trying to find reasons for wars and conflicts outside their own borders .
too many wars still originate from within africa , too many states continue to ruin themselves , he said , adding that many reforms are stuck and countries fail to move ahead . africans have to start addressing their own problems , otherwise donor countries would start wondering what they are spending their money on .
africa can not avoid competition and has to show more responsibility , köhler said . plain language .
but that 's necessary as even in countries like benin and ethiopia - which are largely seen as success stories of democratization - development aid is not just used to combat poverty but also ends up in the pockets of corrupt political elites .
köhler views himself as a friend of africa and believes that friendship does not exclude criticism . europe 's responsibility but he holds europeans responsible as well since africa will continue to be reliant on the support of the global community .
donor countries have to focus on living up to their promise of raising development aid to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 , köhler said , also pointing the finger at his own country , which only spends 0.28 percent of gdp so far . trade barriers and subsidies that distort the global exchange of services and goods should be dismantled in order to make african products competitive , the german president demanded . köhler spent a lot of time talking to people during his trip , and he tried to come into contact with people outside the political arena .
he spoke with representatives of non-governmental organizations , artists and students , with women that have set up their own businesses with the help of micro credits , with people that greeted him on the streets . raising awareness he listened , asked questions and encouraged debates , pushing his political goal to create a true partnership between equal african and european partners . " your president listens to people , " said several of his astonished conversation partners - obviously used to a different approach by their own heads of state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " together for africa , " reads the sign köhler 's trip was meant to honor reform-oriented governments in sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , but the president also wanted to increase africa 's visibility in germany .
he intends to continue doing so as he 's announced that he plans to make a longer trip to africa during each year in office . germans should not view africa as a continent that has no effect on their lives , according to köhle .
weak and failed states such as ivory coast and zimbabwe pose risks for europe .
terror cells operating in africa , especially around the horn of africa , do so as well .
with his first major foreign trip , köhler has shown that africa 's well-being is something that others should be concerned about . ute schaeffer -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cancels ethiopian debt germany is to cancel a € 67-million -lrb- $ 88.68-million -rrb- debt owed by ethiopia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we like to be entertained inside plastic balls , so why should n't mice ?
many researchers are concerned that mice that are treated differently could deviate from the norm and , thus , skew the outcome of experiments . university of giessen animal physiologist hanno würbel and colleagues have challenged this assumption . they used 48 female mice , drawn from two standard breeds , and either housed them in standard cages or in large " enriched " cages where there were tunnels , trapezes and other objects to stimulate them . the mice then took part in four experiments that are classically used in behavioral research - finding their way through mazes and responding to new objects . the rodents performed the same in both tests , thus showing that an " enriched environment " had no effect on the outcome .
not just for behavioral research strictly speaking , the results of würbel 's experiments apply only to behavioral research . but würbel says they should be just as relevant in other branches of lab research . " they should also apply to animals ' physiology or anatomy , which are , in any case , less sensitive than behavior to environmental perturbations , " he said .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .
1 report by the german government on home-made weapon exports .
according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .
otherwise brokers can continue to “ conduct business with weapons without the weapons ever entering germany , ” he explained . katrin matthaei -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german arms exports under fire days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .

the country ’ s churches are alarmed by the development , pointing out that some of the purchasers are questionable . the joint conference for church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- has published a report strongly criticizing the german government for its role in the weapons exports market .
in presenting its report on wednesday , the organization accused the government of " lacking transparency ” and being full of contradictions . the report stated that almost one-quarter of the total volume of arms exports went to countries that the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- called recipients of official development aid .
this contradicts the government 's claim that only 12 percent of exports were sent to developing countries .
the protestant church 's gkke representative , stephan reimers , said those numbers were false and misleading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammar gadhafi is also a buyer of german military equipment .
he said it was particularly troubling that some of the countries on the exports list rank among the poorest in the world , despite germany 's focus on providing development aid to these states .
" the exports to south africa reached hundreds of millions of euros , ” reimers cited as an example , “ yet the country is unable to take necessary measures against aids and other problems that are a result of poverty and illnesses .
this is an example where you can easily see that arms purchases in developing countries has precedence over other duties , " reimers told deutsche welle . china and libya also receive weapons the gkke said it is incomprehensible that chancellor gerhard schröder is calling for an end to the eu weapons embargo against china .
karl jüsten , representative of the german catholic church in the gkke , strongly condemned the attempt . " china is a country that has probably violated or allowed human rights to be violated extensively .
it 's a country that neither fulfils german nor the eu 's criteria for the allowance of military exports , " he said . according to the churches ’ report , the continued sales of military equipment to china and libya contravened the eu 's weapons embargo .
it also damaged the credibility of germany 's restrictive arms export policies . closer monitoring needed the churches ’ critique follows the release of a dec .

according to the most recent figures , sales of military equipment reached € 4.9 billion and export of weapons hit an all-time high in 2003 when it reached € 1.3 billion compared to € 318 million the year before .
since then criticism has poured in from many sides , including the junior coalition partner , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party chairwoman , claudia roth , is critical of german weapon export policy .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , praised the gkke report .
she told the catholic news agency -lrb- kna -rrb- that the government must be careful not to " throw human rights ' criteria overboard " when exporting even small arms .
those countries that purchase small arms should be required to return old weapons , roth demanded .
this would prevent the further redistribution of weapons to instable countries . bernhard moltmann of the peace research institute in frankfurt said in addition to curbing its own weapons sales to questionable countries , germany also needs to monitor more closely the business of arms brokers .
the government should integrate eu regulations concerning weapons brokering into german law , he said .

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .
lufthansa flight attendant herwig schober returned from a recent trip to new york city with more than just his own luggage . “ i picked up three bath towels for a friend and cosmetics and cologne , ” he said .

ten islamists were sentenced thursday for their role in a planned attack on a christmas market in strasbourg .
german secret investigators helped prevent the attack . the defendants from algeria and tunisia received up to 10 years in prison for trying to set off a bomb hidden in a pressure cooker .
the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .

police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .

the fact that the bomb did n't go off and hurt thousands of people is a success story for germany 's secret service . in late 2000 , around the time of the planned attack , investigators from several agencies worked together on the case : they all had information about the so-called " frankfurt cell , " but no agency would have been able to prevent the attack by itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd headquarters near munich long before the eventual arrests , the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- had received information via middlemen about a connection between some of the cell 's members and the terror network of a certain slimane khalfaoi .
as in most cases , the bnd got its information from sources in afghanistan and in the arab world , where the agency has maintained good contacts for decades . details about the frankfurt cell were then passed on to germany 's internal intelligence service , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , as some of the terrorists returned to germany from afghanistan , where they allegedly participated in terror training camps .
bfv agents began listening in on cell members ' conversations and alerted germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- as the threat became imminent and the bomb attack was about to take place .
bka agents finally arrested the men - a step neither bfv nor bnd agents could have taken . questions over intelligence exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masked police officers on the site of german highest court in karlsruhe on dec .
4 as three iraqis , suspected of planning the attack on allawi , were questioned inside this cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned attack on iraqi premier ayad allawi during his visit to berlin in december .
police special units and state criminal police agents bugged phones and observed people .
bfv agents had led them in the right direction .
but according to bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , investigators had no information from bnd or its us counterpart , the cia , about plans by the ansar al-islam organization to assassinate allawi in berlin . but erich schmidt-eenboom , an intelligence expert , said he doubts beckstein 's statement .
according to him bnd officials have passed on information about ansar al-islam to bka agents for years . " i believe that beckstein deliberately does n't reveal information , " he said .
" he should be informed better , what happens on the federal level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies and police is concerned . " beckstein rejects a centralization of investigative agencies as proposed by german interior minister otto schily .
expanding the bka 's powers is one of the things schily would like to accomplish by such a centralization . " no one can explain why the bka can take action once a crime has been committed , but can not do anything to prevent it in the first place , " schily said during the opening of a new center to combat terrorism in berlin on tuesday . barriers remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily -lrb- center -rrb- with bka president jörg ziercke -lrb- right -rrb- and bfv president august hanning during the presentation of the new terror center the new center is an attempt to combine intelligence forces as special agents of all service branches exchange their information and compile reports together .
but a crucial barrier to increased cooperation can not be overcome by this new institution , either : the constitutionally required division between intelligence services and the police .
because of germany 's nazi past , agencies are not allowed to jointly gather information . that 's why schmidt-eenboom opposes schily 's plans . " the bka should not become a secret service without being put under the control of the bundestag , " he said , adding that schily seems to plan to turn the bka into a semi-intelligence agency modelled after the us 's fbi . an increase in information exchange between german law enforcement agencies also creates problems .
the lawyers of the members of the frankfurt cell claim that their clients wanted to explode the bomb inside a synagogue , which would have posed a threat to a much smaller group of people . they say that there 's very little evidence for the theory that the bomb was meant to explode in a christmas market .
it 's hard for judges to determine in such cases , whether intelligence reports are true and complete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he have to reveal more information in the future ?
the bnd in particular does not seem to be interested in letting evidence coming out in the open .
but that 's exactly the way things should be handled in the future , according to schmidt-eenboom . " if intelligence agencies deliver information , they also have to back up their claims in a courtroom , " he said , adding that germany is in need of more cooperation between its existing law enforcement agencies . benjamin denes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.12.2004 the strong euro 's hidden pleasures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why go to paris when paris , las vegas is so much cheaper ?
as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”

as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout . a development that has begun concerning economists and european company chiefs is a welcome relief to kim bradley .
ever since the euro began its rapid rise against the dollar in recent months , the expat american has watched the $ 7,000 credit card bill she left behind in new york city a year ago shrink .
the strong euro has helped the berlin magazine editor pay off her american bills much more quickly . " the dollar can keep falling as far as i 'm concerned , " said bradley , who gets her pay checks in euros . forecasts seem to indicate it will continue to do just that .
at the moment , the euro is hovering at around $ 1.33 , slightly down from the $ 1.346 high it reached last week .
though a boon to europeans travelling abroad - and expats eager to pay off bills - the euro 's rise has set off alarm bells among european leaders and business chiefs . the 12 european countries that use the euro , among them france and germany , are experiencing slow growth rates at the moment and are heavily dependent on the success of their exports .
the strong euro means those exports are more expensive abroad , putting a damper on the continent 's nascent economic recovery . european leaders see a " worrying trend " " exports have been the only engine of growth , ” said manuela preuschl , a deutsche bank financial markets analyst .
electronics or automobile makers who are active in us markets or asian countries which use the dollar , have been especially hard hit .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer said last month that his company ’ s products have risen in price by about 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro has been no laughing matter at siemens over the past few weeks , european leaders have begun voicing concern over the currency ’ s steady rise and the dollar ’ s decline in the past nine months .
finance ministers from the 12 eu countries that use the euro issued a joint declaration last week criticizing the united states for letting its current-account deficit get so out of control .
germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder called the euro ’ s rise “ worrying . ” transatlantic bickering economists believe the us ’ s large current account deficit and washington ’ s massive public spending on security and other areas is a major reason for the dollar ’ s fall and the euro ’ s subsequent rise .
many here are annoyed at the bush administration ’ s deficit spending and its seeming lack of interest in strengthening the dollar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said washington should take care of its own economic issues “ it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing - and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " schröder said .
for all their complaints , european finance ministers , even the european union ’ s central bank , can ’ t do much against the dollar ’ s fall .
evidence of that came after the ministers ’ statements last week , tacitly supported by european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet who had earlier called the euro ’ s rise “ brutal and unwelcome . ”
immediately following their statement on tuesday , the dollar bounced back against the euro but rose again to $ 1.34 later in the day .
it has hovered around $ 1.33 since then .
“ the ecb could intervene to stop the rise , but it won ’ t happen , ” said jerome creel , a french economist at the paris institute ofce .
“ the bank is not so strong and not that credible . ” euro might hit $ 1.40 in a year currency traders were happy with an announcement by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on tuesday : he raised the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other on overnight loans by a quarter percentage point .
the increase in the fund rate , the fifth since june , is designed to temper inflation and might boost the dollar slightly .
but analysts say the euro is will most likely continue to rise .
a recent deutsche bank report forecast that the euro would rise to $ 1.40 over the next 12 months . ” for the time being we still have not reached the top , ” said preuschl , the deutsche bank economist .
in the meantime , europeans seem more willing than in recent years to travel across the pond to see just how far their money will go .
neckermann reisen , one of germany ’ s largest travel agencies , reported booking 10 to 20 percent more trips to the us in the last year than in 2003 , said a spokesman . flight attendant goes shopping “ the dollar has just made it so much cheaper , ” says rolf-dieter grass , whose company is offering european shoppers christmas shopping trips to new york city complete with hotel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the macy 's department store in new york under a shopping siege europeans not able to cross the pond are making sure friends help them take advantage of their currency 's strong position at the moment .
lufthansa flight attendant herwig schober returned from a recent trip to new york city with more than just his own luggage . “ i picked up three bath towels for a friend and cosmetics and cologne , ” he said .
“ at the moment , there are finally positive effects of going over there again . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moaning and groaning germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .

it received a two for its overall service and three for its social care of adults and children , use of resources , environment , benefits and libraries and leisure services .
ms killian added : " if there is not any progress in the next 12 or 18 months the commission can refer hull , like any other council , for action by the government or it can receive additional support . "
' rapid progress ' mr ryley started worked at the labour-run authority last month .
" this is now an organisation with enormous potential to make rapid progress over the next 12 months or so , " he claimed .
" there is a real ambition to deliver visible and lasting improvements quickly for local people and an increasing confidence in our ability to be successful in making these changes happen . "

a planning inspector overturned a south cambridgeshire district council enforcement notice in february .
the judge has ordered john prescott 's department to reconsider the case .

planning inspector clive woodhouse ruled that , as the travellers ' caravans were in the corner of an area of authorised sites , they were not unacceptable .
new planning inquiry in the high court mr justice forbes said the overturning of the council order by mr woodhouse had been wrong in law .
mr justice forbes also quashed the inspector 's decision to allow retrospective permission for caravans used by patrick mccarthy , 68 , his wife and their 18-year-old grandson , daniel o 'rourke .
a spokesman for south cambridgeshire district council said a new planning inquiry would be held in about a year to reconsider the case again from scratch .

but now scientists think they have found a link between some common infections and more serious conditions .
and that could mean it 's possible to predict if an individual is likely to have a cardiac arrest allowing time for preventive action .
breakfast will have more on this during thursday 's programme we 'll be speaking to our resident gp dr rosemary leonard at 0845 gmt she will be joined in the studio by dr liam smeeth who led the research for the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine understanding scientists say the research which links three infections to heart attacks and strokes is a major breakthrough and will give a greater understanding .
heart and circulatory disease facts heart attacks and circulatory disease are britain 's biggest killer 270 ' 000 people suffer a heart attack every year - that 's one person every two minutes coronary heart disease kills 117 ' 000 people a year year chd claims more lives in the winter months british heart foundation the respiratory infections which cause pneumonia and bronchitis have been connected to heart attacks along with cystitis which is an infection of the urinary tract .
all three are said to increase the chance of suffering a cardiac arrest by five times and triple the risk of having a stroke for the first week after falling ill .
however the risk is only short lived and drops away after a few weeks .
research scientists funded by the british heart foundation , the medical research council and the wellcome trust looked at the medical records of 40 ' 000 patients .
the lead researcher was dr liam smeeth who is an epidemiologist at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine .
you can find links to all the above organisations from the top right hand side of this page " insight " another of the project 's researchers , professor patrick vallance at the bhf laboratory at university college hospital in london said : ' the work shows the timing of a heart attack is not random .
the question " why today ? " is now answered in part and the research provides an insight into what eventually triggers a heart attack or stroke . "
scientists say there is no increased risk from vaccines for flu and tetanus .
the reason for the link is thought to be due to inflammation caused by infection which leads to cardio vascular problems - even a minor or brief infection can trigger an attack .
dr smeeth says that people should n't be too scared about the research but he thinks it is an interesting scientific breakthrough .

the public inquiry started on 10 november 2003 and will have sat for a total of 90 days .
attempts have been made for more than 100 years to obtain national park status to protect the area .
the 73 miles -lrb- 118km -rrb- of rolling chalk hills extend across more than 400,000 acres from eastbourne in east sussex to winchester in hampshire .
inspector 's report if approved , national park status will give the area the same protection as places like the peak district and the lake district .
the park has the backing of the countryside agency and conservation groups who want the area preserved and protected from development .
objectors to the scheme include landowning and farming groups , who fear increased restrictions .
and councillors fear they will see their power over local planning matters transferred to a south downs park authority .
local authorities also fear it would attract a higher number of visitors to the area , causing traffic problems .
in the last 13 months , over 5,800 representations have been made to a government planning inspector .
the inspector will now prepare a report and recommendations for a decision by the secretary of state for environment , food and rural affairs .
