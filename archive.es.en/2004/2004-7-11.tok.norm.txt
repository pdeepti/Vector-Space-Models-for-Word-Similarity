if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...

europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .

' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .

according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .

will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "
daryl lindsey , with reporting assistance from helen groumas and sophie duron back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa and the eu in the past year , the european union drafted its first space policy and even defined it as a fundamental priority in the draft constitution .
its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams .
-lrb- june 27 , 2004 -rrb- space and european security long taboo , european union leaders now want to foster the growth of a europe-wide defense industry .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .

the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .

the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .

the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .
military orders are so significant that the consumer applications are easy to develop . "
will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the egyptian pyramids seen from an esa satellite .
the same equipment could also help track troop movements or global hotspots .
nevertheless , there is increasing willingness to at least explore the idea of creating a more u.s.-like defense industry structure .
that would foster a more stable future for major european space players like eads space -lrb- based in france , germany , spain and britain -rrb- , france 's alcatel space , italy 's alenia spazio and the hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that work with them .
it would also help cash-strapped national defense agencies that are being asked to do more with less . daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's great space race with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams .

if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2004 europe 's great space race back to first page back 2/2 europe has many pots on the stove right now , including its slick solar system missions .
but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ? part one of a three-part special report : last christmas , the scientists at the european space agency 's mission control in darmstadt , germany , burned the midnight oil .
bleary eyes scanned flickering monitors for signs that the agency 's first mars lander had arrived safely .
if things had gone according to script , the beagle 2 would have sent back a signal playing a short ditty by the british group blur .
but instead of doing a celebratory dance to a pop tune , esa scientists sat stunned as the computers broadcast nothing but an ominous silence " it was very tense , " david southwood , the affable , white-maned head of science at the european space agency admitted .
" we had really committed ourselves to something , and this was the first time the wrong thing happened and we had a null result . "
a few weeks later , esa gave up the search , declaring beagle dead on arrival .
but a guardian angel appeared to be watching over the scientists .
almost as quickly as the news of failure came , the agency chalked up its first mars success .
on jan .
19 , the agency , which includes 15 european member states , released the first spectacular images from the german-designed , high-resolution camera carried by its mars express probe , which began orbiting earth 's closest neighbor the same month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image of mars ' grand canyon , the valles marineris , taken by the german-developed high-resolution stereo camera on board mars express .
" seeing the pictures , i thought : we 've really done it , " southwood said .
on the next day the pictures , which had been beamed down from space , were splashed across the front pages of european newspapers .
four days later , esa scored another triumph : mars express had detected frozen water on the red planet .
europe comes into its own over the past 18 months , europe 's space science ambitions have begun to crystallize .
besides mars express , the agency has volleyed the comet-chasing rosetta spacecraft halfway across the solar system , sent a probe to the moon and shuttled european astronauts to the international space station .
behind the steady stream of projects tailor-made for national geographic , something more profound is unfolding in europe .
in an increasing number of areas , esa is starting to give the united states space program a run for its money .
" there 's a recognition in the u.s. that europe has very strong space capabilities , " explained james lewis , director of technology public policy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" we 're in a crux period here as we are in other aspects of the transatlantic relationship about whether we will work cooperatively or competitively . "
as the chairman of the european parliament 's sky and space intragroup , gilles savary of france is an outspoken champion of an expanding european space program .
he said rivalry with the u.s. is healthy : " it is competition , but competition is sometimes good because it stimulates technology and promotes performance . "

before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .

" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .

in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .

" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .

with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ? part one of a three-part special report : last christmas , the scientists at the european space agency 's mission control in darmstadt , germany , burned the midnight oil .
bleary eyes scanned flickering monitors for signs that the agency 's first mars lander had arrived safely .
if things had gone according to script , the beagle 2 would have sent back a signal playing a short ditty by the british group blur .
but instead of doing a celebratory dance to a pop tune , esa scientists sat stunned as the computers broadcast nothing but an ominous silence " it was very tense , " david southwood , the affable , white-maned head of science at the european space agency admitted .
" we had really committed ourselves to something , and this was the first time the wrong thing happened and we had a null result . "
a few weeks later , esa gave up the search , declaring beagle dead on arrival .
but a guardian angel appeared to be watching over the scientists .
almost as quickly as the news of failure came , the agency chalked up its first mars success .
on jan .
19 , the agency , which includes 15 european member states , released the first spectacular images from the german-designed , high-resolution camera carried by its mars express probe , which began orbiting earth 's closest neighbor the same month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image of mars ' grand canyon , the valles marineris , taken by the german-developed high-resolution stereo camera on board mars express .
" seeing the pictures , i thought : we 've really done it , " southwood said .
on the next day the pictures , which had been beamed down from space , were splashed across the front pages of european newspapers .
four days later , esa scored another triumph : mars express had detected frozen water on the red planet .
europe comes into its own over the past 18 months , europe 's space science ambitions have begun to crystallize .
besides mars express , the agency has volleyed the comet-chasing rosetta spacecraft halfway across the solar system , sent a probe to the moon and shuttled european astronauts to the international space station .
behind the steady stream of projects tailor-made for national geographic , something more profound is unfolding in europe .
in an increasing number of areas , esa is starting to give the united states space program a run for its money .
" there 's a recognition in the u.s. that europe has very strong space capabilities , " explained james lewis , director of technology public policy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" we 're in a crux period here as we are in other aspects of the transatlantic relationship about whether we will work cooperatively or competitively . "
as the chairman of the european parliament 's sky and space intragroup , gilles savary of france is an outspoken champion of an expanding european space program .
he said rivalry with the u.s. is healthy : " it is competition , but competition is sometimes good because it stimulates technology and promotes performance . "

but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .

esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "

some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .

the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .
military orders are so significant that the consumer applications are easy to develop . "
will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .

nevertheless , there is increasing willingness to at least explore the idea of creating a more u.s.-like defense industry structure .

with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ? part one of a three-part special report : last christmas , the scientists at the european space agency 's mission control in darmstadt , germany , burned the midnight oil .
bleary eyes scanned flickering monitors for signs that the agency 's first mars lander had arrived safely .
if things had gone according to script , the beagle 2 would have sent back a signal playing a short ditty by the british group blur .
but instead of doing a celebratory dance to a pop tune , esa scientists sat stunned as the computers broadcast nothing but an ominous silence " it was very tense , " david southwood , the affable , white-maned head of science at the european space agency admitted .
" we had really committed ourselves to something , and this was the first time the wrong thing happened and we had a null result . "
a few weeks later , esa gave up the search , declaring beagle dead on arrival .
but a guardian angel appeared to be watching over the scientists .
almost as quickly as the news of failure came , the agency chalked up its first mars success .
on jan .
19 , the agency , which includes 15 european member states , released the first spectacular images from the german-designed , high-resolution camera carried by its mars express probe , which began orbiting earth 's closest neighbor the same month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image of mars ' grand canyon , the valles marineris , taken by the german-developed high-resolution stereo camera on board mars express .
" seeing the pictures , i thought : we 've really done it , " southwood said .
on the next day the pictures , which had been beamed down from space , were splashed across the front pages of european newspapers .
four days later , esa scored another triumph : mars express had detected frozen water on the red planet .
europe comes into its own over the past 18 months , europe 's space science ambitions have begun to crystallize .
besides mars express , the agency has volleyed the comet-chasing rosetta spacecraft halfway across the solar system , sent a probe to the moon and shuttled european astronauts to the international space station .
behind the steady stream of projects tailor-made for national geographic , something more profound is unfolding in europe .
in an increasing number of areas , esa is starting to give the united states space program a run for its money .
" there 's a recognition in the u.s. that europe has very strong space capabilities , " explained james lewis , director of technology public policy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" we 're in a crux period here as we are in other aspects of the transatlantic relationship about whether we will work cooperatively or competitively . "
as the chairman of the european parliament 's sky and space intragroup , gilles savary of france is an outspoken champion of an expanding european space program .
he said rivalry with the u.s. is healthy : " it is competition , but competition is sometimes good because it stimulates technology and promotes performance . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2004 space and european security back to first page back 2/2 with an agreement in february to create a new eu " defense capabilities , development and acquisitions agency , " brussels is embarking on a path that eventually may fuel the growth of a networked european defense sector .
the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .
military orders are so significant that the consumer applications are easy to develop . "
will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the egyptian pyramids seen from an esa satellite .
the same equipment could also help track troop movements or global hotspots .
nevertheless , there is increasing willingness to at least explore the idea of creating a more u.s.-like defense industry structure .
that would foster a more stable future for major european space players like eads space -lrb- based in france , germany , spain and britain -rrb- , france 's alcatel space , italy 's alenia spazio and the hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that work with them .

if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...

if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .

but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2004 space and european security back to first page back 2/2 with an agreement in february to create a new eu " defense capabilities , development and acquisitions agency , " brussels is embarking on a path that eventually may fuel the growth of a networked european defense sector .
the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .
military orders are so significant that the consumer applications are easy to develop . "
will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the egyptian pyramids seen from an esa satellite .
the same equipment could also help track troop movements or global hotspots .
nevertheless , there is increasing willingness to at least explore the idea of creating a more u.s.-like defense industry structure .
that would foster a more stable future for major european space players like eads space -lrb- based in france , germany , spain and britain -rrb- , france 's alcatel space , italy 's alenia spazio and the hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that work with them .
it would also help cash-strapped national defense agencies that are being asked to do more with less . daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's great space race with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .

the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ? part one of a three-part special report : last christmas , the scientists at the european space agency 's mission control in darmstadt , germany , burned the midnight oil .
bleary eyes scanned flickering monitors for signs that the agency 's first mars lander had arrived safely .
if things had gone according to script , the beagle 2 would have sent back a signal playing a short ditty by the british group blur .
but instead of doing a celebratory dance to a pop tune , esa scientists sat stunned as the computers broadcast nothing but an ominous silence " it was very tense , " david southwood , the affable , white-maned head of science at the european space agency admitted .
" we had really committed ourselves to something , and this was the first time the wrong thing happened and we had a null result . "
a few weeks later , esa gave up the search , declaring beagle dead on arrival .
but a guardian angel appeared to be watching over the scientists .
almost as quickly as the news of failure came , the agency chalked up its first mars success .
on jan .
19 , the agency , which includes 15 european member states , released the first spectacular images from the german-designed , high-resolution camera carried by its mars express probe , which began orbiting earth 's closest neighbor the same month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image of mars ' grand canyon , the valles marineris , taken by the german-developed high-resolution stereo camera on board mars express .
" seeing the pictures , i thought : we 've really done it , " southwood said .
on the next day the pictures , which had been beamed down from space , were splashed across the front pages of european newspapers .
four days later , esa scored another triumph : mars express had detected frozen water on the red planet .
europe comes into its own over the past 18 months , europe 's space science ambitions have begun to crystallize .
besides mars express , the agency has volleyed the comet-chasing rosetta spacecraft halfway across the solar system , sent a probe to the moon and shuttled european astronauts to the international space station .
behind the steady stream of projects tailor-made for national geographic , something more profound is unfolding in europe .
in an increasing number of areas , esa is starting to give the united states space program a run for its money .
" there 's a recognition in the u.s. that europe has very strong space capabilities , " explained james lewis , director of technology public policy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" we 're in a crux period here as we are in other aspects of the transatlantic relationship about whether we will work cooperatively or competitively . "
as the chairman of the european parliament 's sky and space intragroup , gilles savary of france is an outspoken champion of an expanding european space program .
he said rivalry with the u.s. is healthy : " it is competition , but competition is sometimes good because it stimulates technology and promotes performance . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .

will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .

but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .

" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .

esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .

some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .

if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .

" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .

esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .

but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .

those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2004 europe 's great space race 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like washington , europe also wants to send astronauts to mars .
with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .
but does it have a chance of beating nasa in the space game ? part one of a three-part special report : last christmas , the scientists at the european space agency 's mission control in darmstadt , germany , burned the midnight oil .
bleary eyes scanned flickering monitors for signs that the agency 's first mars lander had arrived safely .
if things had gone according to script , the beagle 2 would have sent back a signal playing a short ditty by the british group blur .
but instead of doing a celebratory dance to a pop tune , esa scientists sat stunned as the computers broadcast nothing but an ominous silence " it was very tense , " david southwood , the affable , white-maned head of science at the european space agency admitted .
" we had really committed ourselves to something , and this was the first time the wrong thing happened and we had a null result . "
a few weeks later , esa gave up the search , declaring beagle dead on arrival .
but a guardian angel appeared to be watching over the scientists .
almost as quickly as the news of failure came , the agency chalked up its first mars success .
on jan .
19 , the agency , which includes 15 european member states , released the first spectacular images from the german-designed , high-resolution camera carried by its mars express probe , which began orbiting earth 's closest neighbor the same month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image of mars ' grand canyon , the valles marineris , taken by the german-developed high-resolution stereo camera on board mars express .
" seeing the pictures , i thought : we 've really done it , " southwood said .
on the next day the pictures , which had been beamed down from space , were splashed across the front pages of european newspapers .
four days later , esa scored another triumph : mars express had detected frozen water on the red planet .
europe comes into its own over the past 18 months , europe 's space science ambitions have begun to crystallize .
besides mars express , the agency has volleyed the comet-chasing rosetta spacecraft halfway across the solar system , sent a probe to the moon and shuttled european astronauts to the international space station .
behind the steady stream of projects tailor-made for national geographic , something more profound is unfolding in europe .
in an increasing number of areas , esa is starting to give the united states space program a run for its money .
" there 's a recognition in the u.s. that europe has very strong space capabilities , " explained james lewis , director of technology public policy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" we 're in a crux period here as we are in other aspects of the transatlantic relationship about whether we will work cooperatively or competitively . "

the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .
military orders are so significant that the consumer applications are easy to develop . "
will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the egyptian pyramids seen from an esa satellite .
the same equipment could also help track troop movements or global hotspots .
nevertheless , there is increasing willingness to at least explore the idea of creating a more u.s.-like defense industry structure .
that would foster a more stable future for major european space players like eads space -lrb- based in france , germany , spain and britain -rrb- , france 's alcatel space , italy 's alenia spazio and the hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that work with them .
it would also help cash-strapped national defense agencies that are being asked to do more with less . daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's great space race with the success of its first mars probe , the planned launch of the galileo satellite navigation system , europe is emerging as a global space power .

europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...
this is an important subject for all of us , for every european citizen .
space must be part of the answer to our security challenges .

a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .

the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .

boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .

the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .
military orders are so significant that the consumer applications are easy to develop . "
will members go for it ?
the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .
and an institute for foreign affairs panel convened by esa predicted it would take at least 15 years before defense space systems are brought together at the eu level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the egyptian pyramids seen from an esa satellite .

nevertheless , there is increasing willingness to at least explore the idea of creating a more u.s.-like defense industry structure .
that would foster a more stable future for major european space players like eads space -lrb- based in france , germany , spain and britain -rrb- , france 's alcatel space , italy 's alenia spazio and the hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that work with them .

the agency will be responsible for coordinating defense research and development , standardizing military requirements and encouraging member states to combine their procurement efforts at a european level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned military plane airbus a 400 m - a rare success story in european defense cooperation .
according to daniel keohane of the center for european reform in london , during its early stages , the agency will neither have a procurement budget nor the ability to manage procurement programs .
instead , it will seek to coordinate cooperation between existing agencies .
they include occar , a defense partnership between britain , france , germany and italy , which is responsible for administering the a400 project -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the second big player is the western european armaments organization , a 19-member group that conducts international defense research and development .
officials responsible for establishing the agency have indicated space would play an important role in its work .
if it is able to generate procurement contracts for space-related defense applications , the trickle-down effect for civilian space projects would be considerable .
" the u.s. 's leading role in terms of aerospace and aeronautics boils down to the dualist concept , " explains gilles savary , who heads the european parliament 's space policy group .
" its influence is driven by the huge defense budget .

the benefits of a political consolidation of european defense policy for the space program are tremendous , but whether or not the willpower exists in national capitals to hand the reins of sensitive security issues to brussels is an open question .
brussels played virtually no role in the diplomacy surrounding the iraq war .
it has also proven difficult in the past to coordinate cooperation between different european players .
france and germany have failed in two different efforts to launch joint military satellites .

a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .

if brussels succeeds in consolidating the sector , it could be a major boon for the space program . part three of a three-part special report .
before the end of the cold war , it would have been political heresy for europe to pursue a space strategy with a major security element .
but with the fall of the berlin wall came new security challenges – like organized crime , mass migration , destruction of habitats and terrorism - that could only be addressed with space-based intelligence .
a report on space security policy published in october by rome 's institute for foreign affairs concluded that space-based earth observation tools are also necessary for the european union to fulfil the so-called " petersberg " tasks - the basic military duties including peacekeeping and crisis management laid out in the treaty of the european union .
they would also be required for the operation of a rapid reaction force , the eu 's proposed 60,000 strong contingent of troops that could respond quickly to global security crises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galileo satellite constellation will help cars navigate crowded highways , but it will also provide precise tracking for european soldiers .
those new challenges are also prompting new ways of thinking about space in europe .
" the distinction between defense-related and civil space systems makes little sense today , " european space agency director jean-jacques dordain said .
" the same satellites , the same systems can be used for both .
in the u.s. , defense is the main driving force behind the development of space systems that offer important civil benefits . "
in europe , he said , the opposite is happening - civil institutions are funding projects that will play a major role in security and defense .
shifting priorities some forward looking space policy experts are calling on the eu to centralize policy-making and the creation of demand in brussels - not only for civilian space applications , but also for the defense side .
that 's already starting to happen , though at a snail 's pace .
" europe is now moving towards its own security research program , " european commissioner for research phillipe busquin recently said .
" the fact is that europe has long been handicapped in this area due to the fact that security has been a ' no-go ' area for us . "
esa 's charter expresses that its work must be for " peaceful purposes , " which kept it out of the defense debate for decades .
however , its charter has recently been interpreted by an expert panel at rome 's institute for foreign affairs to mean that it can develop and launch " non-aggressive " security-related systems if it is asked to do so by " national or international bodies in charge of security . "
in the past , europe has had less incentive to actively pursue that avenue , but the staggering prices of defense technologies are making greater cooperation a more attractive option for member states .
the 25 eu member states spent about € 180 billion a year on defense , a distant second to the estimated € 330 billion spent by the united states . with a few high-profile examples , like the airbus a400m military transport plane , there has been little cooperation in research , development and procurement .
some estimates suggest national governments could save € 5 billion each year , become more internationally competitive and , by spurring demand for security or defense-related projects , create jobs by increasing europe 's joint purchasing power .
a recent report on space policy by the european commission and the european parliament warned : " europe 's limited commitment to defense-related space activities leads to technological deficiencies due to insufficient investments in some areas . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2004 europe 's great space race back to first page back 2/2 europe has many pots on the stove right now , including its slick solar system missions .
but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .
if we want to maintain the expertise , if we want to maintain the strength of our industry in europe , we need to have a new and stronger look at space . "

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .

by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2004 esa and the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past year , the european union drafted its first space policy and even cemented space as an eu competency in the draft constitution .
its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...
this is an important subject for all of us , for every european citizen .
space must be part of the answer to our security challenges .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...
this is an important subject for all of us , for every european citizen .

its new partnership with esa could give new momentum to european space dreams . part two of a three-part special report .
europe has long had its eyes on the sky .
it shaped airbus into the world 's leading airplane manufacturer , and most commercial satellites that are launched into space hitch rides on europe 's ariane rockets .
now , the european union wants to take the gains of its member states to an even higher level , setting only its budget as the limit . indeed , europe 's -lrb- draft -rrb- constitution calls for a european space policy to promote scientific and technical progress as well as industrial competitiveness .
for three years the european community has been working with officials at the european space agency to define a general space policy for all of europe , one that meets the eu 's strategic , security and scientific demands .
a series of high-profile reports culminated in november 2003 with the establishment of a cooperative agreement between the ec and esa .
the pact entered into force in may and the two bodies created a high-level panel of experts on space and security in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
though esa will not become an official eu agency , the two bodies will be working closer together than ever before - with brussels defining the main lines of policy for many pan-european projects like galileo or the global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- initiative and paris-headquartered esa managing their implementation .
' an indispensable tool for europe ' " the european union is taking a strong interest in space because we realize more and more that space is an indispensable tool in realizing our objectives , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior aide to the european commissioner for research , told professionals at a conference in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" sustainable development , scientific and industrial competitiveness and security are important areas that involve space science . "
vandenberghe noted that the eu already relies on satellites to monitor its agricultural , environmental and civil protection policies .
" our intention is to make space a part of the eu political project by building further on what already exists today , " he said .
a string of recent natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated that a unified european space program could not only save money , but lives as well .
record summer flooding in eastern germany in 2002 caused an estimated € 15 billion in damage .
systems and data to help authorities forecast the event existed at the time , but individual eu countries had different tools , and none of it was centralized .
" if we were able to build a cross-border system that allows public authorities to anticipate such events , we would be able to substantially lower the damages .
that 's what gmes is about , " vandenberghe said .
the same holds true for the catastrophic 2002 prestige oil spill off the coasts of spain and france .
" if data had been available in real time , " he said , " a lot of this pollution could have been prevented . "
boosting the economy officials in brussels have also identified space as a sector that could help fuel economic growth .
" we believe we have convinced the heads of government that space can help relaunch the economy , " luc tytgat , head of the european space policy unit at the european commission said .
europe-wide civilian and security projects could give a needed boost to european space contractors like eads , alcatel or alenia spazio , giving them a more reliable economic base than the highly fluctuating commercial satellite launching business .
but the new eu-esa ties could also give a boost to scientific projects .
david southwood , director of science at esa , said he hopes the alignment with brussels will help jumpstart space projects that are currently languishing due to limited funding , like the aurora vision for manned space flight to mars .
finding unity " i hope we will get europe firmly using space in every possible way it can be used , " he told dw-world , " and the alignment with the european union is a very important part of that .
the eu is the best way to organize the very useful aspects of space , like navigation systems and environmental monitoring . "
but visions like aurora , he says , have even greater potential to foster european unity .
" we 're all still italians , germans or dutch underneath and european second , " southwood says .
" to get a grand program like this going you have to be european first .
but that 's also why taking on grand projects together and succeeding in them is part of europe 's realizing that together it can achieve more than it can as a bunch of isolated individual states . "
with a single vision for europe in space , brussels hopes , it will be possible to bring all 25 member states under a single , ambitious tent .
" we have an important and difficult job to do , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain recently said in brussels .
" we have the new issue of border control in an enlarged europe .
we have the fight against terrorism .
we have crisis management and humanitarian aid .
balancing these priorities will be difficult , but that ’ s what makes this exercise so important . ...
this is an important subject for all of us , for every european citizen .

but it 's three other programs currently in development that are likely to have the most impact on everyday life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is the european answer to the american gps satellite system .
thirty satellites will help serve the navigation needs of millions when it goes into service in 2008 .
esa and its contractors throughout europe are preparing for a 2008 launch of the galileo constellation of satellites , which will eliminate europe 's reliance on the american military 's global positioning system .
the € 3.2 billion galileo project , which comprises about 30 modern-day sputniks , will provide precise tracking information across the globe to as many as 2.5 billion users by 2020 , according to a price-waterhouse coopers study .
it will help control traffic on europe 's streets and in the skies , as well as provide soldiers with precise positioning during peacekeeping missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites like envisat-1 are helping the european union to better monitor changes on earth .
another cluster of satellites , global monitoring for the environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- , will help europe guard its borders and study climate and environmental changes .
gmes can also help the eu monitor policy compliance , like ensuring that farmers are growing crops in sync with their subsidies or that countries are adhering to international treaties like the kyoto protocol .
closer to home , the satellites are to provide real-time tracking of disasters like last summer 's wildfires in france , the 2002 flooding in eastern germany or human catastrophes like the recent escalation of violence in kosovo .
a third proposal , eeurope , aims to bring satellite-based high-speed internet access and other services linked to europe 's goal of boosting innovation and research to become the leading knowledge-based society , to far-flung corners of the continent , from lapland to rural farmlands , reducing the digital divide and bringing services like telemedicine to places where hospitals do n't have access to specialists .
the proposed plan would be especially important for parts of southern europe with antiquated telecommunications infrastructures .
a space race ?
europe 's celestial ambitions are already raising eyebrows in washington .
some fear the technology gap in the americans ' favor - something the u.s. has always encouraged - is starting to close .
though galileo and gmes are being launched with civilian intentions , both have dual-use capabilities .
" people who say europe and china are a threat to the u.s. are translating military considerations , " explained laurence nardon , a space policy expert at the french institute for international relations in paris .
" there 's a desire in washington to always have the u.s. one generation ahead technologically than any competitors .
now , many see europe as encroaching on u.s. capacities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car navigation is only one application of satellite positioning .
galileo will also be used to track freight on trucks and manage europe 's crowded skies .
the galileo program has long been a thorn in the side of transatlantic relations .
the past two u.s. administrations have opposed the project , describing it as a threat to the planned military expansion of its own gps codes and an unnecessary duplication of technology .
the u.s. feared that galileo 's " public regulated service " signal , which was very close in frequency to the planned m-code , would make it impossible for the u.s. military to scramble its own code in an emergency .
but such scrambling has also been at the heart of the debate between brussels and washington : europeans point out that the pentagon deliberately scrambled its gps signal for security reasons during the kosovo war , thereby handicapping non-military gps devices in many areas .
europe says that shows its lack of reliability for civilian uses .
a deal has since been reached that will move europe 's prs-code to a less proximate frequency and make gps and galileo interoperable .
nevertheless , the sometimes acrimonious tug-of-war leading up to the deal will unlikely be forgotten .
" u.s. military space dominance began to be very clearly recognized with the first gulf war , " said joan johnson-freese , a space expert at the naval war college in newport , rhode island .
europe had very strong feelings during the first space war " about having to ask the u.s. for imagery , having to rely on the united states for providing navigation systems .
sometimes the u.s. was open to sharing and sometimes it was n't . "
esa and nasa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a major participant in the international space station project , supplying both the columbus research laboratory and the automated transfer vehicles that will be used to ferry supplies to it .
questions also persist about the future of esa 's relationship with nasa in the united states .
for decades , the two agencies have worked closely together on scientific projects as well as the ambitious and expensive international space station .
yet even where there is cooperation , problems sometimes arise .
washington 's desire to remain " preeminent in space " can sometimes appear like bully behavior to others .
" europe participates in american initiatives in space science and in manned flight , " a 2003 european commission report stated .
" however , as a general rule , and thanks to the size of its investment , nasa expects to remain in control of design , development and means of launch such that europe contributes to the less strategic aspects of space missions . "
still , overall ties between the european and american space programs are robust .
" esa is the u.s. 's main partner in space today and , while we have achieved a great deal on our own , what most people do n't realize is that almost every task now being undertaken in space , whether by us , by the russians or by the americans , is the result of co-operation , " esa director general jacques-jean dordain recently said .
ultimately , esa 's close cooperation with nasa could also shape its own future .
life after the space shuttle president george w. bush recently announced that the space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and that construction of the international space station must be completed by then .
the announcement has two major implications .
the first is that russia and europe will have to take charge of getting astronauts and supplies to the station after the shuttles are mothballed .
second , european space experts will have to get more serious about the possibility of creating a full-scale manned space program in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without more funding , sketches like this will be the closest europe gets to mars .
esa is already getting started , beefing up a launching facility in south america and moving forward on its " aurora " study , which would send humans to the moon and mars .
but the € 9 million invested in aurora so far is only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens or hundreds of billions it would take to transform the vision into reality .
and that 's esa 's biggest problem : unless its members show more willingness to dig deeper into their pockets , such visions will never leave the drawing board .
anemic space spending the european advisory group on aeronautics noted in a recent report that in 1999 u.s. aerospace companies posted revenues of € 33.7 billion from space-related business , of which three-quarters was funded by the department of defense and nasa .
by comparison , european companies had made less than € 5.5 million , and only half came from government sources .
moreover , public funding for space programs in europe averages less than € 15 per head .
the u.s. spends € 110 per person .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a consensus can sometimes be difficult for esa , which has 15 member states .
bureaucracy is proving another stumbling block for europe .
in the u.s. , washington determines funding and priorities for the space program , while the esa must get approvals from as many as 15 different countries .
it must also compete with a number of national space agencies for funding .
some of that could change as the eu funnels more money towards esa for projects like galileo or gmes , but expensive visions like aurora will still be at the mercy of national governments .
the organization 's complicated structure also makes it possible for members to opt out of individual programs .
the european commission has called for more than doubling its annual research budget , from the current € 5 billion a year to € 12 billion starting in 2007 .
many of the eu 's space proposals are depending on the extra cash infusion .
but calls from paris and berlin to freeze the current eu budget and the costs of europe 's eastern expansion mean those additional funds are anything but certain .
" we now have come to a point where we need to drastically and radically reinforce this effort , " kurt vandenberghe , a senior advisor to the european commissioner for research , told a space conference organized by the catholic university and the space consultancy firm systemics network international in leuven , belgium , earlier this year .
" otherwise we risk gradually losing the basis that we have .

prototype mobile lets japanese view terrestrial digital tv shows mobile tv has been tried before , never with much success .
there is the problem of getting decent reception while you are on the move , let alone the issue of battery life and watching programmes on a tiny screen .
the truth is , the bar has been set high .
a mobile tv service has to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation .
" the most important thing to realise about the difference between mobile tv and digital tv is that with digital tv at home , you 've got an unlimited power supply and a large aerial on the roof of the building , both of which are quite handy , " said mark squires of nokia .
screen technology itself has advanced in the last few years , making the viewing experience much more enjoyable .
but tv screens are notoriously power hungry .
in mobile versions the backlight and speaker will need to be on throughout the programme .
clear picture however , a method called time-slicing means that at least the receiver is not on all the time .
the tv function is fun and convenient but also very expensive .
i only watched about 45 minutes and it cost me about $ 50 noh eun kyung , mobile tv user " time-slicing is a way of making the device 's battery last a lot longer because it is n't running all the time , " explained mr squires .
" what 's actually happening is that the programme it 's receiving is being sent to it in very intense bursts of data , and between those bursts it allows the device to completely shut down , apart , obviously , from the screen and the sound .
" to the user it looks like the programme is being received constantly , all the time , but in fact the device is in a sleep state for the majority of the time . "
receiving the programme in short , high-speed bursts means that the signal is received a few seconds before it is needed , and that buffering means that the device can also cope with short breaks in reception .
so if you go under a bridge , you will not lose the picture .
costly service korea and japan are way ahead of the game and have been testing several methods of reception for a couple of years .
the existing korean 3g network is fast enough to stream live tv .
it is basically broadband tv on your mobile .
" i first watched tv on my mobile phone when i went fishing , " said noh eun kyung , a mobile tv user .
" i had missed an episode of my favourite tv drama so i began watching it using my phone .
" the tv function is fun and convenient but also very expensive .
i only watched about 45 minutes and it cost me about $ 50 . "
cost , it seems , will be an important factor in mobile tv 's success .
rival technologies it is generally agreed that content is also an issue as it will simply not be enough to rebroadcast the hundreds of existing channels to mobiles .
norwegians can watch tv content on mobiles " we are developing specific content for mobile portable devices , " said steve turner of philips semiconductors .
" our expectations with the mobile environment is that you will want a quick fix ; it wo n't be plain old tv , it 'll be high priority content , whatever your personal profile is .
" it could be sports , could be music , could be anything , but it 's something that you would probably not want to wait for . "
in asia , the race for the best mobile tv coverage is on .
sk telecom will soon launch a rival to the 3g service , broadcasting mobile tv by satellite .
and because consistency has never featured highly in technology circles , a third method is on its way .
in europe , trials in berlin and helsinki are using existing terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with additional receivers .
now broadcasters are thinking about making the right kind of programmes and making sure people can afford to watch them .
mobile tv is on its way , but it will probably be some time before television really breaks out of its box in the living room .

he said it should also consider laws to tackle alcohol abuse and obesity .
mr galbraith said now was an opportune moment to act and that politicians should be brave enough to take tough and unpopular decisions .
he said giving health advice would only work to a certain extent and sometimes " nanny state " legislation was needed .
statutory action mr galbraith told bbc scotland 's sunday live : " getting people to change their lifestyle and all the efforts we have made over the years has just been money down a black hole .
" it has been essentially ineffective and part of the reason for that is that you have got to change the life circumstances as well as changing the lifestyles . "
the former minister said : " the area we have always been lacking in is actually taking some statutory action .
" we 've been frightened to do this because everyone calls you a nanny state .
" this is an opportune moment for statutory action .
for introducing various bans and curtailments .
therefore i think we will bitterly regret it if we let it slip by this time . "
mr galbraith , a former neurosurgeon , was minister for health at the scottish office in the run-up to devolution in 1999 .
if you are a popular politician after five years in government then you have not done anything sam galbraith with the formation of the scottish parliament he became education minister before resigning on health grounds in 2001 .
the former mp and msp for strathkelvin and bearsden was one of the first people in europe to undergo a lung transplant in 1990 .
he said that during his time in politics he had taken many unpopular decisions and saw that as part of the politicians job .
he said : " my view of a politician is that if you are not unpopular as a politician then you are not doing any good .
' stop smoking ' " people find change difficult .
the job of a politician is to ensure that happens .
the result of that is that politicians become unpopular .
" if you are a popular politician after five years in government then you have not done anything . "
he also called for statutory action to reduce salt in foods and the withdrawal of fizzy drinks from schools .
scottish national party msp stewart maxwell , who has introduced a member 's bill to ban smoking in public places serving food , welcomed mr galbraith 's call for a smoking ban .
he said : " the priority for us all must be to protect the health of non-smokers in scotland and the best way to do this is to implement a ban as quickly as possible and msps can do this by voting for my bill in the autumn . "
the executive is conducting a public consultation until september to see if people want a new law introduced to stop smoking in public places .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- what will lord butler say ?
bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home sunday , 11 july , 2004 , 08:48 gmt 09:48 uk what will lord butler say ? by john ware bbc panorama reporter why did they get it so wrong ?
that is the fundamental question lord butler should address in his report .
the claim that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction was central to the dossier the government published in the autumn of 2002 prior to the vote in parliament which authorised the prime minister to send british troops to invade iraq .
that dossier was , as the prime minister insisted , " in large part the work of the intelligence services " .
supervising its drafting was john scarlett , then chairman of the joint intelligence committee -lrb- jic -rrb- , and a former senior officer in m16 .
his document may well have been crucial in persuading many members of parliament to vote for the war .
yet its central claim was wrong .
the error of thinking that saddam had a wmd arsenal is described on bbc panorama by michael herman , a former secretary to the jic as " the biggest failure of intelligence since the failure to predict the german offensive in the ardennes at the end of 1944 " .
specific assertion even tony blair now admits saddam 's weapons of mass destruction may never be found .
in their defence , britain 's intelligence services will no doubt have insisted to lord butler that saddam acted like a dictator who had weapons of mass destruction and was trying to hide them .
after all , he had used them against iran and against the kurds ; he had obstructed the un inspection teams ; and he 'd been caught lying when iraqi officials had said they 'd never had a biological weapons programme - just as one was being identified .
i doubt , however , that lord butler will be satisfied with that defence .
the claim made by the intelligence dossier was that saddam could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes .
an assertion as specific as that must have been based on more than general suppositions derived from saddam 's past record .
and yet , as lord butler will have discovered , the raw material on which the jic based the 45 minute claim turns out to have been astonishingly thin : there were no details about the location of the weapons , or their size , or whether the warheads were actually chemical or biological , or whether they were battlefield shells or ballistic missiles .
surprising " tony blair was personally convinced that saddam continued to possess weapons of mass destruction " john ware a further surprising aspect of the 45 minute claim is that up until the autumn of 2002 , the jic was unwilling to pronounce unequivocally on whether or not saddam still possessed any weapons of mass destruction at all .
dr brian jones , then the british intelligence establishment 's top analyst on the topic , thought that there was " an absence of any firm intelligence " on iraq 's production of chemical weapons .
interestingly , before the autumn of 2002 , the jic had broadly shared dr jones ' expert assessment .
the claim in the spring of 2002 that saddam " may have retained some chemical and biological agents and munitions " from before the 1990 gulf war was as far as the jic was willing to go .
and even then , jic emphasised that it could not say whether the dangerous agents in the munitions were still effective .
lord butler 's report will reveal what led the jic to change its view so radically .
john scarlett , who was promoted by the prime minister earlier this year to the post of head of mi6 , has explained that mi6 received new intelligence from iraq on 11 september 2002 .
that was precisely the moment when the notorious dossier was being prepared .
the first draft of the dossier had already been criticised by one of the prime minister 's advisers as " intelligence lite " .
difficult decision the new intelligence conveniently arrived the same day that the jic put out " a last call " for more items of intelligence to strengthen the dossier 's claims on saddam 's weapons of mass destruction , because " no 10 ... want the document to be as strong as possible within the bounds of available intelligence " .
the following day , the jic 's chief drafter was on the telephone to number 10 offering to come over to ask the press office if they were on the right track .
sir richard dearlove , then chief of mi6 , went personally to the prime minister to announce the arrival of what is believed to be the same intelligence which was corroboration for saddam 's " recent production of chemical and biological weapons agents " .
sir richard personally attested to its credibility , saying that it could be used to underpin assertions in the dossier - but also insisting there could be no specific references to it .
the new intelligence was so secret it was not even shown to the intelligence services ' own experts - analysts such as dr jones - never mind assessed by them .
it was , however , used to support the dossier 's central claim : that saddam had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch within 45 minutes .
yet , aside from the 45 minutes report , sir richard 's new intelligence seems to have been substantially all that had changed since the previous spring to support the claim that saddam had any workable weapons of mass destruction at all .
personally convinced " sir andrew 's -lrb- turnbull , cabinet secretary -rrb- visibility during the dossier episode seems to have been very low .
lord butler , a previous occupant of the job , may be extremely critical of this " john ware as we all now know , the new intelligence turned out not to be reliable : it was false .
i have been told that it has recently been formally withdrawn by mi6 .
that incident illustrates how difficult it will be for lord butler to avoid the conclusion that the jic in general , and sir richard and john scarlett in particular , were too ready to accommodate the prime minister that , consciously or not , they adapted their judgements to fit his beliefs .
tony blair was personally convinced that saddam continued to possess weapons of mass destruction .
lord butler may find , however , that what little reliable intelligence there was on iraq simply did not support that view .
the reliable intelligence did not even support the view that saddam represented a threat to britain .
tony blair insisted , in the foreword to the dossier , that he believed iraq was a serious and current threat .
right up to the last moment , the drafts of the dossier were thought by no 10 to do " nothing to demonstrate a threat , let alone an imminent threat , from saddam .
it does not demonstrate he has the motive to attack his neighbours , let alone the west " .
scarlett obligingly redrafted a passage in the dossier so that it clearly implied that saddam posed a threat - at least to his neighbours .
scarlett said he did it because he had found some " quite clear evidence " to support it .
lord butler may find that his decision to rewrite passages of the dossier had more to do with the fact that the spooks got bewitched by the glamour of being part of the tiny circle around tony blair taking all key policy decisions on iraq - and tailored their judgements accordingly .
full debate in his public statements the prime minister asserted that saddam was a threat because he might link up with terrorist groups such as al-qaeda and pass on his weapons of mass destruction , or the know-how to build them .
two months after the publication of the dossier , the jic came to the conclusion that there was no intelligence to indicate that iraq had considered using chemical and biological agents in terrorist attacks .
that fact was not , however , disclosed to parliament or public - despite mr blair 's promise when he announced the publication of the intelligence dossier to facilitate the " fullest possible debate ... as the situation develops " .
sir andrew turnbull , as cabinet secretary , was perhaps in the best position to explain to mr blair that he ought to take a more even-handed approach in his publication of intelligence , given that it was not evidence but judgement and assessment and therefore inherently risky .
however , sir andrew 's visibility during the dossier episode seems to have been very low .
lord butler , a previous occupant of the job , may be extremely critical of this .
michael herman , a former secretary to the jic , quotes approvingly that " interested policy makers quickly learn that intelligence can used the way a drunk uses a lamp post - for support rather than illumination " .
lord butler , in more measured , mandarin language , may conclude that this is what happened in the case of the iraq dossier - with blair as the drunk , and the jic as his lamp post .

that is the fundamental question lord butler should address in his report .
the claim that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction was central to the dossier the government published in the autumn of 2002 prior to the vote in parliament which authorised the prime minister to send british troops to invade iraq .
that dossier was , as the prime minister insisted , " in large part the work of the intelligence services " .
supervising its drafting was john scarlett , then chairman of the joint intelligence committee -lrb- jic -rrb- , and a former senior officer in m16 .
his document may well have been crucial in persuading many members of parliament to vote for the war .
yet its central claim was wrong .
the error of thinking that saddam had a wmd arsenal is described on bbc panorama by michael herman , a former secretary to the jic as " the biggest failure of intelligence since the failure to predict the german offensive in the ardennes at the end of 1944 " .
lord butler 's report will be published on wednesday specific assertion even tony blair now admits saddam 's weapons of mass destruction may never be found .
in their defence , britain 's intelligence services will no doubt have insisted to lord butler that saddam acted like a dictator who had weapons of mass destruction and was trying to hide them .
after all , he had used them against iran and against the kurds ; he had obstructed the un inspection teams ; and he 'd been caught lying when iraqi officials had said they 'd never had a biological weapons programme - just as one was being identified .
i doubt , however , that lord butler will be satisfied with that defence .
the claim made by the intelligence dossier was that saddam could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes .
an assertion as specific as that must have been based on more than general suppositions derived from saddam 's past record .
and yet , as lord butler will have discovered , the raw material on which the jic based the 45 minute claim turns out to have been astonishingly thin : there were no details about the location of the weapons , or their size , or whether the warheads were actually chemical or biological , or whether they were battlefield shells or ballistic missiles .
surprising tony blair was personally convinced that saddam continued to possess weapons of mass destruction john ware a further surprising aspect of the 45 minute claim is that up until the autumn of 2002 , the jic was unwilling to pronounce unequivocally on whether or not saddam still possessed any weapons of mass destruction at all .
dr brian jones , then the british intelligence establishment 's top analyst on the topic , thought that there was " an absence of any firm intelligence " on iraq 's production of chemical weapons .
interestingly , before the autumn of 2002 , the jic had broadly shared dr jones ' expert assessment .
the claim in the spring of 2002 that saddam " may have retained some chemical and biological agents and munitions " from before the 1990 gulf war was as far as the jic was willing to go .
and even then , jic emphasised that it could not say whether the dangerous agents in the munitions were still effective .
lord butler 's report will reveal what led the jic to change its view so radically .
john scarlett , who was promoted by the prime minister earlier this year to the post of head of mi6 , has explained that mi6 received new intelligence from iraq on 11 september 2002 .
that was precisely the moment when the notorious dossier was being prepared .
the first draft of the dossier had already been criticised by one of the prime minister 's advisers as " intelligence lite " .
the front page of the government 's iraq dossier difficult decision the new intelligence conveniently arrived the same day that the jic put out " a last call " for more items of intelligence to strengthen the dossier 's claims on saddam 's weapons of mass destruction , because " no 10 ... want the document to be as strong as possible within the bounds of available intelligence " .
the following day , the jic 's chief drafter was on the telephone to number 10 offering to come over to ask the press office if they were on the right track .
sir richard dearlove , then chief of mi6 , went personally to the prime minister to announce the arrival of what is believed to be the same intelligence which was corroboration for saddam 's " recent production of chemical and biological weapons agents " .
sir richard personally attested to its credibility , saying that it could be used to underpin assertions in the dossier - but also insisting there could be no specific references to it .
the new intelligence was so secret it was not even shown to the intelligence services ' own experts - analysts such as dr jones - never mind assessed by them .
it was , however , used to support the dossier 's central claim : that saddam had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch within 45 minutes .
yet , aside from the 45 minutes report , sir richard 's new intelligence seems to have been substantially all that had changed since the previous spring to support the claim that saddam had any workable weapons of mass destruction at all .

that is the fundamental question lord butler should address in his report .
the claim that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction was central to the dossier the government published in the autumn of 2002 prior to the vote in parliament which authorised the prime minister to send british troops to invade iraq .
that dossier was , as the prime minister insisted , " in large part the work of the intelligence services " .
supervising its drafting was john scarlett , then chairman of the joint intelligence committee -lrb- jic -rrb- , and a former senior officer in m16 .
his document may well have been crucial in persuading many members of parliament to vote for the war .
yet its central claim was wrong .
the error of thinking that saddam had a wmd arsenal is described on bbc panorama by michael herman , a former secretary to the jic as " the biggest failure of intelligence since the failure to predict the german offensive in the ardennes at the end of 1944 " .
lord butler 's report will be published on wednesday specific assertion even tony blair now admits saddam 's weapons of mass destruction may never be found .
in their defence , britain 's intelligence services will no doubt have insisted to lord butler that saddam acted like a dictator who had weapons of mass destruction and was trying to hide them .
after all , he had used them against iran and against the kurds ; he had obstructed the un inspection teams ; and he 'd been caught lying when iraqi officials had said they 'd never had a biological weapons programme - just as one was being identified .
i doubt , however , that lord butler will be satisfied with that defence .
the claim made by the intelligence dossier was that saddam could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes .
an assertion as specific as that must have been based on more than general suppositions derived from saddam 's past record .
and yet , as lord butler will have discovered , the raw material on which the jic based the 45 minute claim turns out to have been astonishingly thin : there were no details about the location of the weapons , or their size , or whether the warheads were actually chemical or biological , or whether they were battlefield shells or ballistic missiles .
surprising tony blair was personally convinced that saddam continued to possess weapons of mass destruction john ware a further surprising aspect of the 45 minute claim is that up until the autumn of 2002 , the jic was unwilling to pronounce unequivocally on whether or not saddam still possessed any weapons of mass destruction at all .
dr brian jones , then the british intelligence establishment 's top analyst on the topic , thought that there was " an absence of any firm intelligence " on iraq 's production of chemical weapons .
interestingly , before the autumn of 2002 , the jic had broadly shared dr jones ' expert assessment .
the claim in the spring of 2002 that saddam " may have retained some chemical and biological agents and munitions " from before the 1990 gulf war was as far as the jic was willing to go .
and even then , jic emphasised that it could not say whether the dangerous agents in the munitions were still effective .
lord butler 's report will reveal what led the jic to change its view so radically .
john scarlett , who was promoted by the prime minister earlier this year to the post of head of mi6 , has explained that mi6 received new intelligence from iraq on 11 september 2002 .
that was precisely the moment when the notorious dossier was being prepared .
the first draft of the dossier had already been criticised by one of the prime minister 's advisers as " intelligence lite " .
the front page of the government 's iraq dossier difficult decision the new intelligence conveniently arrived the same day that the jic put out " a last call " for more items of intelligence to strengthen the dossier 's claims on saddam 's weapons of mass destruction , because " no 10 ... want the document to be as strong as possible within the bounds of available intelligence " .
the following day , the jic 's chief drafter was on the telephone to number 10 offering to come over to ask the press office if they were on the right track .
sir richard dearlove , then chief of mi6 , went personally to the prime minister to announce the arrival of what is believed to be the same intelligence which was corroboration for saddam 's " recent production of chemical and biological weapons agents " .
sir richard personally attested to its credibility , saying that it could be used to underpin assertions in the dossier - but also insisting there could be no specific references to it .
the new intelligence was so secret it was not even shown to the intelligence services ' own experts - analysts such as dr jones - never mind assessed by them .
it was , however , used to support the dossier 's central claim : that saddam had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch within 45 minutes .
yet , aside from the 45 minutes report , sir richard 's new intelligence seems to have been substantially all that had changed since the previous spring to support the claim that saddam had any workable weapons of mass destruction at all .
personally convinced sir andrew 's -lrb- turnbull , cabinet secretary -rrb- visibility during the dossier episode seems to have been very low .
lord butler , a previous occupant of the job , may be extremely critical of this john ware as we all now know , the new intelligence turned out not to be reliable : it was false .
i have been told that it has recently been formally withdrawn by mi6 .
that incident illustrates how difficult it will be for lord butler to avoid the conclusion that the jic in general , and sir richard and john scarlett in particular , were too ready to accommodate the prime minister that , consciously or not , they adapted their judgements to fit his beliefs .
tony blair was personally convinced that saddam continued to possess weapons of mass destruction .
lord butler may find , however , that what little reliable intelligence there was on iraq simply did not support that view .
the reliable intelligence did not even support the view that saddam represented a threat to britain .
tony blair insisted , in the foreword to the dossier , that he believed iraq was a serious and current threat .
right up to the last moment , the drafts of the dossier were thought by no 10 to do " nothing to demonstrate a threat , let alone an imminent threat , from saddam .
it does not demonstrate he has the motive to attack his neighbours , let alone the west " .
scarlett obligingly redrafted a passage in the dossier so that it clearly implied that saddam posed a threat - at least to his neighbours .
scarlett said he did it because he had found some " quite clear evidence " to support it .
lord butler may find that his decision to rewrite passages of the dossier had more to do with the fact that the spooks got bewitched by the glamour of being part of the tiny circle around tony blair taking all key policy decisions on iraq - and tailored their judgements accordingly .
mod weapons expert dr brian jones said there was an absence of firm intelligence on iraq 's wmds full debate in his public statements the prime minister asserted that saddam was a threat because he might link up with terrorist groups such as al-qaeda and pass on his weapons of mass destruction , or the know-how to build them .
two months after the publication of the dossier , the jic came to the conclusion that there was no intelligence to indicate that iraq had considered using chemical and biological agents in terrorist attacks .
that fact was not , however , disclosed to parliament or public - despite mr blair 's promise when he announced the publication of the intelligence dossier to facilitate the " fullest possible debate ... as the situation develops " .
sir andrew turnbull , as cabinet secretary , was perhaps in the best position to explain to mr blair that he ought to take a more even-handed approach in his publication of intelligence , given that it was not evidence but judgement and assessment and therefore inherently risky .
however , sir andrew 's visibility during the dossier episode seems to have been very low .
lord butler , a previous occupant of the job , may be extremely critical of this .
michael herman , a former secretary to the jic , quotes approvingly that " interested policy makers quickly learn that intelligence can used the way a drunk uses a lamp post - for support rather than illumination " .
lord butler , in more measured , mandarin language , may conclude that this is what happened in the case of the iraq dossier - with blair as the drunk , and the jic as his lamp post .
