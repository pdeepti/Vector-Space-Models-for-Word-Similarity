" suite francaise " was written in 1942 as irene nemirovsky waited in rural france for what she knew was her imminent arrest and deportation .
it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .
in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .
she and her sister , who is now dead , then waited another quarter of a century before finally deciding to publish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers occupied paris in june 1940 .
" suite francaise " consists of a first section , entitled " june storm , " which recounts the tangled stories of several families forced to flee northern france as the invading germans approach .
the pettiness and cruelty of the population is mercilessly exposed , as suffering rips away the veneer of respectability . in part two - " dolce " - nemirovsky examines the compromises and moral confusion that ensue when a village is occupied by german soldiers . now aged 74 , denise epstein says the book is not just a novel .
" above all it is a log-book written by my mother through the dark years .
all the people she writes about and takes such pains to create - we knew them .
all the situations - we lived through them , " she said . " during the 1930s my mother wanted to believe that france would defend the jews .
afterwards she was for years seen just as a victim and her talent was forgotten .

heads of state will have to try to resolve the issue in brussels . britain retains opt-out earlier britain said it backed eu efforts to boost cooperation on immigration and asylum policy but must retain a right to opt out of decisions which threaten its interests . " we -lrb- are -rrb- clearly all in this together because people move through the new borders of eastern and central europe , " said british home secretary david blunkett .
" so it is in our interest to get agreement about sensible border controls run by the countries themselves but supported by the rest of europe . " immigration has become a hot political issue in britain as the government has sought to beat back popular fears of a flood of asylum-seekers and economic migrants from an enlarged eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair wants the best of both worlds for his country at his monthly news conference in london , british prime minister tony blair said there was no question of britain giving up its veto on border controls . " we are not obliged to have any of the european rules here , " he said .
" but where we decide in a particular area - for example to halt the trafficking in people , for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the european borders that end up affecting our country - it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures . " " with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe , " blair said .
" unless we opt in we are not affected by it .
and what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds . " at the luxembourg meeting france and germany opposed any specific reference to legal immigration quotas , as pressed for by spain and italy . on the issue of asylum britain , germany and portugal expressed doubts about moving to a common policy by 2010 , preferring to wait and see how recently adopted common standards for accepting asylum seekers and examining their requests were working out . no agreement on asylum centers the idea of setting up centers for asylum seekers in north africa , as advocated by germany and italy , failed to win general backing . but there was agreement on the need to work with the countries of origin of the seekers and with those through which they transited , with the aim of stopping them from trying to cross the mediterranean . the eu wants to keep them in protected zones near countries in turmoil , help north african states take them in and write provisions about the return of illegal immigrants into association agreements . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to tackle asylum and security policy eu justice and interior ministers on monday will discuss the future policy course on a wide-ranging security and immigration program that includes controversial proposals for refugee detention camps in africa .

the departure of moma was soon forgotten amid the fanfare that accompanied the unveiling of the friedrich christian flick exhibition , and the 30,000 visitors to the annual art forum in late september proved that the german capital is firmly on the international art map . the eagerly-awaited re-opening of the berlinische galerie is another string to its artistic bow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figures by edward and nancy reddin kienholz are on exhibit in the gallery officially known as the state museum for modern art , photography and architecture , it was founded as a private initiative in 1975 and boasts a unique collection of berlin secessionism , expressionism , dadaism , neue sachlichkeit , avantgarde architecture and photography , as well as work by modern movements such as the " jungen wilden " and the fluxus group . the spill-over effect but it 's only now that the gallery is moving into its very own space .
housed in the martin gropius bau until 1997 , director jörn merkert 's museum has been homeless for the last seven years .
various potential premises were investigated , but obstacles varying from bankrupt landlords to rocketing rents resulted in years of delay . the new building near daniel libeskind 's landmark jewish museum in the district of kreuzberg was converted at a relatively low cost of € 18.7 million -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- , most of which came from private sponsorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid sokow 's " end of the world " sculpture the berlinische galerie 's first task will be to establish a profile in a city recently spoilt by blockbuster shows boasting advertising budgets undreamt of in cash-strapped berlin - but at least it might benefit from its neighbor 's fame . " when i tell people in new york and paris that my new museum is situated two minutes from the jewish musuem , then they know things ca n't be bad , " said jörn merkert in a recent interview with der tagesspiegel . a welcome return merkert also pointed out that although the berlin public needs to be reminded of this world-class museum on its doorstep , " the one million new residents in the city -lrb- since 1997 -rrb- do n't know us at all . " for some , the re-opening marks the welcome return of a valuable local landmark , while others can acquaint themselves for the first time with artists ranging from local hero georg grosz to east german enfant terrible georg baselitz . as the show 's 700,000 pieces were given a final polish before the opening , the museum director looked forward to contributing to berlin 's cultural profile .
in an interview with dw-world , he stressed that the museum had a healthy awareness of its social role . " we 've set up an art school for children , for example , because we want to make sure we maintain a bridge to the community , " he said .
" we want to be a museum that 's firmly anchored in local urban life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view inside the gallery spokesperson jutta berg also emphasized the museum 's strong ties to the city . " we 're the only museum that covers art that emerged from berlin itself .
we exhibit , collect and preserve it , " she told ap . many believe that berlin 's extraordinary legacy of 20th century art has been undersold for too long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.10.2004 opinion : absent , awkward , aimless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say prodi did n't deliver a stellar performance outgoing eu commission president romano prodi gave his last speech on monday .
while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .
to take an example , prodi refused to back down in the matter of bse-infected meat and won the fight against states that had argued for laxer rules . # b # the 65-year-old is now hoping to return to the circle of heads of state , many of whom often gave him the cold shoulder over the last few years .
italian voters will be the ones to decide whether he returns to national politics in 2006 .
in brussels , however , people view this outgoing commission as a good one , with a mediocre , weak president at the helm . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fate of incoming eu commission still uncertain eu commission president prodi indicated friday that his team was prepared for an extension of its term as the crisis over incoming president barroso 's choice of commissioners continued to rage in brussels .

closer cooperation in economic and cultural matters will top the agenda , in particular the eu 's target to surpass the united states as the leading world economic power by 2010 and reforming the 41-year-old franco-german youth office devoted to exchanges . german government spokesman bela anda stressed on monday that germany would be at the forefront of making europe the strongest economic region by 2010 . " the chancellor believes that europe will be able to master this route , " anda said .
but he added the continent would have to make greater efforts than it is currently . anda 's statements came at the heels of news reports that , with only six years remaining , the eu is even further from becoming the most competitive economy than when it set the objective - dubbed the lisbon agenda - in the portuguese capital in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing european commission president romano prodi in an interview published monday in the financial times -lrb- ft -rrb- newspaper , outgoing european commission chief romani prodi declared that " lisbon is a big failure .

schröder is turkey 's most important backer for entry to the bloc , despite some wavering from his fellow social democrats and skepticism from the country 's conservative opposition . chirac , too , supports the turks in their quest to join the eu , but few of his conservative party colleagues share his stance .
he has announced that french voters will vote on the matter . before that happens , however , eu leaders at a summit in december are supposed to lay out turkey 's prospects of joining the bloc , either setting a date for accession talks to begin or proposing an alternative relationship to the country . erdogan will also oversee the final signature on state-run turkish airlines ' contract to buy 36 airbus planes worth $ 2.8 billion -lrb- € 2.19 billion -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mending the franco-german industrial rift french finance minister nicolas sarkozy meets with counterpart wolfgang clement in berlin on monday in an attempt to heal the recent rifts in franco-german industrial relations with plans for a shipbuilding alliance .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .

the departure of moma was soon forgotten amid the fanfare that accompanied the unveiling of the friedrich christian flick exhibition , and the 30,000 visitors to the annual art forum in late september proved that the german capital is firmly on the international art map . the eagerly-awaited re-opening of the berlinische galerie is another string to its artistic bow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figures by edward and nancy reddin kienholz are on exhibit in the gallery officially known as the state museum for modern art , photography and architecture , it was founded as a private initiative in 1975 and boasts a unique collection of berlin secessionism , expressionism , dadaism , neue sachlichkeit , avantgarde architecture and photography , as well as work by modern movements such as the " jungen wilden " and the fluxus group . the spill-over effect but it 's only now that the gallery is moving into its very own space .
housed in the martin gropius bau until 1997 , director jörn merkert 's museum has been homeless for the last seven years .
various potential premises were investigated , but obstacles varying from bankrupt landlords to rocketing rents resulted in years of delay . the new building near daniel libeskind 's landmark jewish museum in the district of kreuzberg was converted at a relatively low cost of € 18.7 million -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- , most of which came from private sponsorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid sokow 's " end of the world " sculpture the berlinische galerie 's first task will be to establish a profile in a city recently spoilt by blockbuster shows boasting advertising budgets undreamt of in cash-strapped berlin - but at least it might benefit from its neighbor 's fame . " when i tell people in new york and paris that my new museum is situated two minutes from the jewish musuem , then they know things ca n't be bad , " said jörn merkert in a recent interview with der tagesspiegel . a welcome return merkert also pointed out that although the berlin public needs to be reminded of this world-class museum on its doorstep , " the one million new residents in the city -lrb- since 1997 -rrb- do n't know us at all . " for some , the re-opening marks the welcome return of a valuable local landmark , while others can acquaint themselves for the first time with artists ranging from local hero georg grosz to east german enfant terrible georg baselitz . as the show 's 700,000 pieces were given a final polish before the opening , the museum director looked forward to contributing to berlin 's cultural profile .
in an interview with dw-world , he stressed that the museum had a healthy awareness of its social role . " we 've set up an art school for children , for example , because we want to make sure we maintain a bridge to the community , " he said .
" we want to be a museum that 's firmly anchored in local urban life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view inside the gallery spokesperson jutta berg also emphasized the museum 's strong ties to the city . " we 're the only museum that covers art that emerged from berlin itself .
we exhibit , collect and preserve it , " she told ap . many believe that berlin 's extraordinary legacy of 20th century art has been undersold for too long .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .
to take an example , prodi refused to back down in the matter of bse-infected meat and won the fight against states that had argued for laxer rules . # b # the 65-year-old is now hoping to return to the circle of heads of state , many of whom often gave him the cold shoulder over the last few years .
italian voters will be the ones to decide whether he returns to national politics in 2006 .
in brussels , however , people view this outgoing commission as a good one , with a mediocre , weak president at the helm . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fate of incoming eu commission still uncertain eu commission president prodi indicated friday that his team was prepared for an extension of its term as the crisis over incoming president barroso 's choice of commissioners continued to rage in brussels .

" suite francaise " was written in 1942 as irene nemirovsky waited in rural france for what she knew was her imminent arrest and deportation .
it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .
in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .
she and her sister , who is now dead , then waited another quarter of a century before finally deciding to publish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers occupied paris in june 1940 .
" suite francaise " consists of a first section , entitled " june storm , " which recounts the tangled stories of several families forced to flee northern france as the invading germans approach .
the pettiness and cruelty of the population is mercilessly exposed , as suffering rips away the veneer of respectability . in part two - " dolce " - nemirovsky examines the compromises and moral confusion that ensue when a village is occupied by german soldiers . now aged 74 , denise epstein says the book is not just a novel .
" above all it is a log-book written by my mother through the dark years .
all the people she writes about and takes such pains to create - we knew them .
all the situations - we lived through them , " she said . " during the 1930s my mother wanted to believe that france would defend the jews .
afterwards she was for years seen just as a victim and her talent was forgotten .
i hope this book will do justice to what she was above all else - a writer .

the departure of moma was soon forgotten amid the fanfare that accompanied the unveiling of the friedrich christian flick exhibition , and the 30,000 visitors to the annual art forum in late september proved that the german capital is firmly on the international art map . the eagerly-awaited re-opening of the berlinische galerie is another string to its artistic bow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figures by edward and nancy reddin kienholz are on exhibit in the gallery officially known as the state museum for modern art , photography and architecture , it was founded as a private initiative in 1975 and boasts a unique collection of berlin secessionism , expressionism , dadaism , neue sachlichkeit , avantgarde architecture and photography , as well as work by modern movements such as the " jungen wilden " and the fluxus group . the spill-over effect but it 's only now that the gallery is moving into its very own space .
housed in the martin gropius bau until 1997 , director jörn merkert 's museum has been homeless for the last seven years .
various potential premises were investigated , but obstacles varying from bankrupt landlords to rocketing rents resulted in years of delay . the new building near daniel libeskind 's landmark jewish museum in the district of kreuzberg was converted at a relatively low cost of € 18.7 million -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- , most of which came from private sponsorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid sokow 's " end of the world " sculpture the berlinische galerie 's first task will be to establish a profile in a city recently spoilt by blockbuster shows boasting advertising budgets undreamt of in cash-strapped berlin - but at least it might benefit from its neighbor 's fame . " when i tell people in new york and paris that my new museum is situated two minutes from the jewish musuem , then they know things ca n't be bad , " said jörn merkert in a recent interview with der tagesspiegel . a welcome return merkert also pointed out that although the berlin public needs to be reminded of this world-class museum on its doorstep , " the one million new residents in the city -lrb- since 1997 -rrb- do n't know us at all . " for some , the re-opening marks the welcome return of a valuable local landmark , while others can acquaint themselves for the first time with artists ranging from local hero georg grosz to east german enfant terrible georg baselitz . as the show 's 700,000 pieces were given a final polish before the opening , the museum director looked forward to contributing to berlin 's cultural profile .
in an interview with dw-world , he stressed that the museum had a healthy awareness of its social role . " we 've set up an art school for children , for example , because we want to make sure we maintain a bridge to the community , " he said .
" we want to be a museum that 's firmly anchored in local urban life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view inside the gallery spokesperson jutta berg also emphasized the museum 's strong ties to the city . " we 're the only museum that covers art that emerged from berlin itself .
we exhibit , collect and preserve it , " she told ap . many believe that berlin 's extraordinary legacy of 20th century art has been undersold for too long .

heads of state will have to try to resolve the issue in brussels . britain retains opt-out earlier britain said it backed eu efforts to boost cooperation on immigration and asylum policy but must retain a right to opt out of decisions which threaten its interests . " we -lrb- are -rrb- clearly all in this together because people move through the new borders of eastern and central europe , " said british home secretary david blunkett .
" so it is in our interest to get agreement about sensible border controls run by the countries themselves but supported by the rest of europe . " immigration has become a hot political issue in britain as the government has sought to beat back popular fears of a flood of asylum-seekers and economic migrants from an enlarged eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair wants the best of both worlds for his country at his monthly news conference in london , british prime minister tony blair said there was no question of britain giving up its veto on border controls . " we are not obliged to have any of the european rules here , " he said .
" but where we decide in a particular area - for example to halt the trafficking in people , for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the european borders that end up affecting our country - it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures . " " with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe , " blair said .
" unless we opt in we are not affected by it .
and what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds . " at the luxembourg meeting france and germany opposed any specific reference to legal immigration quotas , as pressed for by spain and italy . on the issue of asylum britain , germany and portugal expressed doubts about moving to a common policy by 2010 , preferring to wait and see how recently adopted common standards for accepting asylum seekers and examining their requests were working out . no agreement on asylum centers the idea of setting up centers for asylum seekers in north africa , as advocated by germany and italy , failed to win general backing . but there was agreement on the need to work with the countries of origin of the seekers and with those through which they transited , with the aim of stopping them from trying to cross the mediterranean . the eu wants to keep them in protected zones near countries in turmoil , help north african states take them in and write provisions about the return of illegal immigrants into association agreements . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to tackle asylum and security policy eu justice and interior ministers on monday will discuss the future policy course on a wide-ranging security and immigration program that includes controversial proposals for refugee detention camps in africa .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

heads of state will have to try to resolve the issue in brussels . britain retains opt-out earlier britain said it backed eu efforts to boost cooperation on immigration and asylum policy but must retain a right to opt out of decisions which threaten its interests . " we -lrb- are -rrb- clearly all in this together because people move through the new borders of eastern and central europe , " said british home secretary david blunkett .
" so it is in our interest to get agreement about sensible border controls run by the countries themselves but supported by the rest of europe . " immigration has become a hot political issue in britain as the government has sought to beat back popular fears of a flood of asylum-seekers and economic migrants from an enlarged eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair wants the best of both worlds for his country at his monthly news conference in london , british prime minister tony blair said there was no question of britain giving up its veto on border controls .

" but where we decide in a particular area - for example to halt the trafficking in people , for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the european borders that end up affecting our country - it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures . " " with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe , " blair said .
" unless we opt in we are not affected by it .
and what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds . " at the luxembourg meeting france and germany opposed any specific reference to legal immigration quotas , as pressed for by spain and italy . on the issue of asylum britain , germany and portugal expressed doubts about moving to a common policy by 2010 , preferring to wait and see how recently adopted common standards for accepting asylum seekers and examining their requests were working out . no agreement on asylum centers the idea of setting up centers for asylum seekers in north africa , as advocated by germany and italy , failed to win general backing . but there was agreement on the need to work with the countries of origin of the seekers and with those through which they transited , with the aim of stopping them from trying to cross the mediterranean . the eu wants to keep them in protected zones near countries in turmoil , help north african states take them in and write provisions about the return of illegal immigrants into association agreements . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to tackle asylum and security policy eu justice and interior ministers on monday will discuss the future policy course on a wide-ranging security and immigration program that includes controversial proposals for refugee detention camps in africa .

" a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination . " you are aware of the expectations of european citizens ... of the apathy ... of the populist threat from those that want to undermine our union , " he said .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .

6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .

all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .
to take an example , prodi refused to back down in the matter of bse-infected meat and won the fight against states that had argued for laxer rules . # b # the 65-year-old is now hoping to return to the circle of heads of state , many of whom often gave him the cold shoulder over the last few years .
italian voters will be the ones to decide whether he returns to national politics in 2006 .

the reassembling of files from former east germany 's secret police , torn to shreds in the chaos leading up to the fall of communism in the soviet union and the 1990 reunification of germany , would cost the government a further € 50 million -lrb- $ 63.9 million -rrb- , on top of the sums already spent , to buy the advanced machines needed to complete the restoration .
the advanced computer reconstruction systems would be able to restore the 16,000 sacks of shredded stasi files in just five years , experts say , but the spiraling costs have brought the dreams of many to a premature end .
victims of the once-feared stasi are allowed access to their files and many had hoped the restored files would help them find out who had spied on them during the communist era .
government officials have vowed that all shredded files would be maintained and that if funds became available , the program to complete reconstructing the much-feared stasi 's files could be restarted . dw-world.de former dictatorships hoping to learn from german stasi archive berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal . " in order to consolidate the eu 's defense industry , schröder suggested " standardizing munitions to ease intra-eu arms sales .

" the membership of turkey would be in the interest of turkey and in the interest of the stability and democracy of the world and our region , " he said . erdogan warned before leaving for berlin tuesday that his poor , predominantly muslim country would settle for nothing short of full membership in the eu , regardless of efforts within the bloc to slow the process .

it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .

the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.10.2004 eu agrees immigration plans , but opt-outs remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers agreed to work more with immigrants ' countries of origin the european union on monday agreed a new multi-annual plan aimed at boosting cooperation on immigration and asylum policy , but britain insisted on retaining its opt-out on key issues . eu interior ministers thrashed out remaining differences on the so-called hague program , which is due to be approved by eu leaders at a summit in brussels next month . the 25-member bloc 's dutch presidency stressed that the eu should focus on implementing what has already been agreed , rather than launching new projects . efforts to make immigration and frontier control issues subject to qualified majority voting , instead of unanimity as at present , foundered on german opposition .
heads of state will have to try to resolve the issue in brussels . britain retains opt-out earlier britain said it backed eu efforts to boost cooperation on immigration and asylum policy but must retain a right to opt out of decisions which threaten its interests . " we -lrb- are -rrb- clearly all in this together because people move through the new borders of eastern and central europe , " said british home secretary david blunkett .
" so it is in our interest to get agreement about sensible border controls run by the countries themselves but supported by the rest of europe . " immigration has become a hot political issue in britain as the government has sought to beat back popular fears of a flood of asylum-seekers and economic migrants from an enlarged eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair wants the best of both worlds for his country at his monthly news conference in london , british prime minister tony blair said there was no question of britain giving up its veto on border controls . " we are not obliged to have any of the european rules here , " he said .
" but where we decide in a particular area - for example to halt the trafficking in people , for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the european borders that end up affecting our country - it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures . " " with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe , " blair said .
" unless we opt in we are not affected by it .
and what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds . " at the luxembourg meeting france and germany opposed any specific reference to legal immigration quotas , as pressed for by spain and italy . on the issue of asylum britain , germany and portugal expressed doubts about moving to a common policy by 2010 , preferring to wait and see how recently adopted common standards for accepting asylum seekers and examining their requests were working out . no agreement on asylum centers the idea of setting up centers for asylum seekers in north africa , as advocated by germany and italy , failed to win general backing . but there was agreement on the need to work with the countries of origin of the seekers and with those through which they transited , with the aim of stopping them from trying to cross the mediterranean . the eu wants to keep them in protected zones near countries in turmoil , help north african states take them in and write provisions about the return of illegal immigrants into association agreements . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to tackle asylum and security policy eu justice and interior ministers on monday will discuss the future policy course on a wide-ranging security and immigration program that includes controversial proposals for refugee detention camps in africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.10.2004 gay tv channel hits french airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pink tv officials hope the station will help boost gay rights in france france 's first gay and lesbian television station went on the air monday , ready to beam a steady diet of homosexual porn , daily repeats of " wonder woman " and english language comedies into subscribers ' homes . pink tv , as the channel jointly financed by france 's main existing commercial networks is known , hopes to ride on a wave of acceptance for the gay lifestyle in europe and elsewhere . the station , available via satellite or cable for € 9 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- a month , follows the launch of similar ventures in italy and canada over the past three years , and comes just five months ahead of yet another such channel in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand charpentier -lrb- r -rrb- and stephane chapin -lrb- l -rrb- married in june , but the union is illegal under french law .
long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

the departure of moma was soon forgotten amid the fanfare that accompanied the unveiling of the friedrich christian flick exhibition , and the 30,000 visitors to the annual art forum in late september proved that the german capital is firmly on the international art map . the eagerly-awaited re-opening of the berlinische galerie is another string to its artistic bow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figures by edward and nancy reddin kienholz are on exhibit in the gallery officially known as the state museum for modern art , photography and architecture , it was founded as a private initiative in 1975 and boasts a unique collection of berlin secessionism , expressionism , dadaism , neue sachlichkeit , avantgarde architecture and photography , as well as work by modern movements such as the " jungen wilden " and the fluxus group . the spill-over effect but it 's only now that the gallery is moving into its very own space .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment .

" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

the reassembling of files from former east germany 's secret police , torn to shreds in the chaos leading up to the fall of communism in the soviet union and the 1990 reunification of germany , would cost the government a further € 50 million -lrb- $ 63.9 million -rrb- , on top of the sums already spent , to buy the advanced machines needed to complete the restoration .
the advanced computer reconstruction systems would be able to restore the 16,000 sacks of shredded stasi files in just five years , experts say , but the spiraling costs have brought the dreams of many to a premature end .
victims of the once-feared stasi are allowed access to their files and many had hoped the restored files would help them find out who had spied on them during the communist era .
government officials have vowed that all shredded files would be maintained and that if funds became available , the program to complete reconstructing the much-feared stasi 's files could be restarted . dw-world.de former dictatorships hoping to learn from german stasi archive berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts .

it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .

in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .

in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .

all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .

" a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination .

" a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination . " you are aware of the expectations of european citizens ... of the apathy ... of the populist threat from those that want to undermine our union , " he said .
" we have no time to waste .
this is the moment to move on to action . " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : absent , awkward , aimless outgoing eu commission president romano prodi gave his last speech on monday .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

heads of state will have to try to resolve the issue in brussels . britain retains opt-out earlier britain said it backed eu efforts to boost cooperation on immigration and asylum policy but must retain a right to opt out of decisions which threaten its interests . " we -lrb- are -rrb- clearly all in this together because people move through the new borders of eastern and central europe , " said british home secretary david blunkett .
" so it is in our interest to get agreement about sensible border controls run by the countries themselves but supported by the rest of europe . " immigration has become a hot political issue in britain as the government has sought to beat back popular fears of a flood of asylum-seekers and economic migrants from an enlarged eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair wants the best of both worlds for his country at his monthly news conference in london , british prime minister tony blair said there was no question of britain giving up its veto on border controls . " we are not obliged to have any of the european rules here , " he said .
" but where we decide in a particular area - for example to halt the trafficking in people , for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the european borders that end up affecting our country - it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures . " " with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe , " blair said .
" unless we opt in we are not affected by it .
and what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds . " at the luxembourg meeting france and germany opposed any specific reference to legal immigration quotas , as pressed for by spain and italy . on the issue of asylum britain , germany and portugal expressed doubts about moving to a common policy by 2010 , preferring to wait and see how recently adopted common standards for accepting asylum seekers and examining their requests were working out . no agreement on asylum centers the idea of setting up centers for asylum seekers in north africa , as advocated by germany and italy , failed to win general backing . but there was agreement on the need to work with the countries of origin of the seekers and with those through which they transited , with the aim of stopping them from trying to cross the mediterranean . the eu wants to keep them in protected zones near countries in turmoil , help north african states take them in and write provisions about the return of illegal immigrants into association agreements . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to tackle asylum and security policy eu justice and interior ministers on monday will discuss the future policy course on a wide-ranging security and immigration program that includes controversial proposals for refugee detention camps in africa .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

the reassembling of files from former east germany 's secret police , torn to shreds in the chaos leading up to the fall of communism in the soviet union and the 1990 reunification of germany , would cost the government a further € 50 million -lrb- $ 63.9 million -rrb- , on top of the sums already spent , to buy the advanced machines needed to complete the restoration .
the advanced computer reconstruction systems would be able to restore the 16,000 sacks of shredded stasi files in just five years , experts say , but the spiraling costs have brought the dreams of many to a premature end .
victims of the once-feared stasi are allowed access to their files and many had hoped the restored files would help them find out who had spied on them during the communist era .
government officials have vowed that all shredded files would be maintained and that if funds became available , the program to complete reconstructing the much-feared stasi 's files could be restarted . dw-world.de former dictatorships hoping to learn from german stasi archive berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" suite francaise " was written in 1942 as irene nemirovsky waited in rural france for what she knew was her imminent arrest and deportation .
it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .
in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .
she and her sister , who is now dead , then waited another quarter of a century before finally deciding to publish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers occupied paris in june 1940 .
" suite francaise " consists of a first section , entitled " june storm , " which recounts the tangled stories of several families forced to flee northern france as the invading germans approach .
the pettiness and cruelty of the population is mercilessly exposed , as suffering rips away the veneer of respectability . in part two - " dolce " - nemirovsky examines the compromises and moral confusion that ensue when a village is occupied by german soldiers . now aged 74 , denise epstein says the book is not just a novel .
" above all it is a log-book written by my mother through the dark years .
all the people she writes about and takes such pains to create - we knew them .
all the situations - we lived through them , " she said . " during the 1930s my mother wanted to believe that france would defend the jews .
afterwards she was for years seen just as a victim and her talent was forgotten .
i hope this book will do justice to what she was above all else - a writer .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.10.2004 gay tv channel hits french airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pink tv officials hope the station will help boost gay rights in france france 's first gay and lesbian television station went on the air monday , ready to beam a steady diet of homosexual porn , daily repeats of " wonder woman " and english language comedies into subscribers ' homes . pink tv , as the channel jointly financed by france 's main existing commercial networks is known , hopes to ride on a wave of acceptance for the gay lifestyle in europe and elsewhere . the station , available via satellite or cable for € 9 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- a month , follows the launch of similar ventures in italy and canada over the past three years , and comes just five months ahead of yet another such channel in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand charpentier -lrb- r -rrb- and stephane chapin -lrb- l -rrb- married in june , but the union is illegal under french law .
long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

" one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.10.2004 germany , france want turkey in eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac are ready to invite erdogan -lrb- left -rrb- into the fold germany and france offered a ringing endorsement for turkey 's future membership in the eu at a bilateral summit tuesday .
they also criticized as inadequate proposed changes to the pact designed to underpin the euro . ahead of a meeting later tuesday with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder told a news conference that they would vote for ankara to be invited to eu membership talks at a summit in december in brussels . " we are both of the opinion that on december 17 it is about a decision that should give turkey the opportunity to negotiate with the -lrb- european -rrb- commission with the explicit aim of turkey joining the european union and with no other aim , " schröder told reporters . chirac added that it was his " dearest wish " that turkey 's membership talks with the eu end in its joining the bloc . " this decision -lrb- in december -rrb- is based on the recommendations of the european commission , whose favorable conclusion we know and i agree with too , " he said .
" however , there will then be a long-term process of negotiations , which could last 15 years . " schröder has been perhaps the strongest supporter of turkey 's bid within the bloc , while chirac has bowed to domestic pressure for a referendum on ankara 's accession and warned that paris could veto membership talks at any time . talks could begin in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey wants to start official talks to join the eu next year the 25 eu leaders are expected at the december summit to give turkey their green light on starting accession talks , but it is not yet clear when the negotiations could start .
turkey has said it wants the talks to start in early 2005 . chirac told reporters he believed the negotiations could begin " in 2005 or around 2005 . "
" the membership of turkey would be in the interest of turkey and in the interest of the stability and democracy of the world and our region , " he said . erdogan warned before leaving for berlin tuesday that his poor , predominantly muslim country would settle for nothing short of full membership in the eu , regardless of efforts within the bloc to slow the process . " this summit ... is very important with respect to our foreign policy objectives because turkey 's european union accession process has ceased to be an ambiguous process for the eu and has taken an irreversible direction , " erdogan said in a speech before the parliamentary group of his justice and development party . stability pact changes " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , home of the european central bank schröder and chirac also discussed proposed changes to the european union 's stability and growth pact - which underpins the euro .
the german leader told reporters that both men believe the proposals are inadequate . " we share the view that -lrb- commission chief romano -rrb- prodi made some interesting propositions , that the propositions point in the right direction , but that they 're not enough , " schröder said at the joint news conference with chirac . paris and berlin wanted to convince their partners in the 12-country euro zone to " allow member states more room for manoeuvre , for example , with regard to investment in research and development , " schröder said . the stability pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , has become a source of controversy as a growing number of countries fail to respect a rule which limits public deficits to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on pain of stiff financial penalties . at the beginning of september , the eu commission suggested the rules of the pact could be applied more flexibly and that greater account could be taken of a country 's specific situation if it runs up an excessive deficit . the stability pact was effectively suspended last year when germany and france , the two largest euro-zone economies , persuaded the eu to hold off from imposing disciplinary measures despite their repeated violation of the rules . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

" we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.10.2004 germany , france want turkey in eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac are ready to invite erdogan -lrb- left -rrb- into the fold germany and france offered a ringing endorsement for turkey 's future membership in the eu at a bilateral summit tuesday .
they also criticized as inadequate proposed changes to the pact designed to underpin the euro . ahead of a meeting later tuesday with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder told a news conference that they would vote for ankara to be invited to eu membership talks at a summit in december in brussels . " we are both of the opinion that on december 17 it is about a decision that should give turkey the opportunity to negotiate with the -lrb- european -rrb- commission with the explicit aim of turkey joining the european union and with no other aim , " schröder told reporters . chirac added that it was his " dearest wish " that turkey 's membership talks with the eu end in its joining the bloc . " this decision -lrb- in december -rrb- is based on the recommendations of the european commission , whose favorable conclusion we know and i agree with too , " he said .
" however , there will then be a long-term process of negotiations , which could last 15 years . " schröder has been perhaps the strongest supporter of turkey 's bid within the bloc , while chirac has bowed to domestic pressure for a referendum on ankara 's accession and warned that paris could veto membership talks at any time . talks could begin in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey wants to start official talks to join the eu next year the 25 eu leaders are expected at the december summit to give turkey their green light on starting accession talks , but it is not yet clear when the negotiations could start .
turkey has said it wants the talks to start in early 2005 . chirac told reporters he believed the negotiations could begin " in 2005 or around 2005 . "
" the membership of turkey would be in the interest of turkey and in the interest of the stability and democracy of the world and our region , " he said . erdogan warned before leaving for berlin tuesday that his poor , predominantly muslim country would settle for nothing short of full membership in the eu , regardless of efforts within the bloc to slow the process . " this summit ... is very important with respect to our foreign policy objectives because turkey 's european union accession process has ceased to be an ambiguous process for the eu and has taken an irreversible direction , " erdogan said in a speech before the parliamentary group of his justice and development party . stability pact changes " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , home of the european central bank schröder and chirac also discussed proposed changes to the european union 's stability and growth pact - which underpins the euro .
the german leader told reporters that both men believe the proposals are inadequate . " we share the view that -lrb- commission chief romano -rrb- prodi made some interesting propositions , that the propositions point in the right direction , but that they 're not enough , " schröder said at the joint news conference with chirac . paris and berlin wanted to convince their partners in the 12-country euro zone to " allow member states more room for manoeuvre , for example , with regard to investment in research and development , " schröder said . the stability pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , has become a source of controversy as a growing number of countries fail to respect a rule which limits public deficits to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on pain of stiff financial penalties . at the beginning of september , the eu commission suggested the rules of the pact could be applied more flexibly and that greater account could be taken of a country 's specific situation if it runs up an excessive deficit . the stability pact was effectively suspended last year when germany and france , the two largest euro-zone economies , persuaded the eu to hold off from imposing disciplinary measures despite their repeated violation of the rules . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . while the franco-german relationship often throws up little spats , as a close partnership is wont to do from time to time , the cooperation between two of europe 's main players remains one of the strongest on the continent . nearly two years after chancellor gerhard schröder and president jacques chirac celebrated the 40th anniversary of the reconciliation between the two countries , the relationship has blossomed further with the introduction of many innovative initiatives designed to bring france and germany even closer together at the heart of europe . one of these , the german-french council of ministers , the combined parliamentary group established to achieve more political transparency and cooperation , meets for the fourth time in berlin on tuesday . but the development in relations does not end with closer political ties between the bundestag and the elysee palace .
schröder and chirac had closer ties at grass roots in mind when they met amid the euphoric atmosphere of last january 's anniversary celebrations . they set in motion a project to create a european district involving the towns of strasbourg and kehl on the franco-german border which would be a real test case for european integration .
one and half years on , the little-known project is a microcosm of the larger relationship , with all its successes and failures . cross-cultural education the saint etienne elementary school in the heart of strasbourg has been promoting franco-german relations for ten years now and was chosen as the focus point of the initiative .
pupils have language lessons in french and german and other subjects investigate cultural differences and shared history .
it is a model that is unique in europe , something head mistress isabelle schuler is very proud of . " there is not only a linguistic background at this school , but also a cultural one , " she told deutsche welle .
" we celebrate , for example , saint martin 's day festival which is very important in germany .
we try and introduce the children into the culture : we make lanterns and practice the saint martin 's songs .
the families are invited , of course , and then we have parents and grandparents - and all singing together .
everyone is involved in experiencing the importance of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children of the euro-district travel and learn together .
the children of saint etienne come from strasbourg and kehl , a community of young french and germans growing up in a european sphere .
the spirit of community is helped by the fact that the french town of strasbourg and the german town of kehl are only separated by a bridge . the school is seen as a model for further cultural exchange projects along the french-german border .
the leaders of both countries are very keen to develop further initiatives which can promote the international collaboration .
but while the project is unique and offers hope to those wanting closer ties , there will always be problems . not all smooth sailing " there have been misunderstandings , " explained günther petry , the mayor of kehl .
" but this is completely natural when members of two different cultures so closely cooperate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a collaboration in law enforcement between french and german police in the district highlighted problems .
things do not always run smoothly .
after a change in the power structure in kehl 's town hall , which saw a conservative majority take charge , cooperative events between the french and the germans have sometimes been a cause of friction at political , judicial and social levels . the landmark german french garden show , one of the biggest international projects undertaken between the towns , almost did n't happen .
despite wrangling over costs , the show still opened in spring 2004 .
the debate over who should foot the bill still continues . a secret agenda ? there is also a suspicion in kehl 's corridors of power that the proud metropolis of strasbourg may be using the euro-district project to add impetus for an ambitious town development plan which includes the planned construction of a high-speed train route between paris and strasbourg .
there is also not as much cooperation as was hoped . " there is here no information on the job market over there and vice versa , " said petry .
" or questions related to health care .
or why a letter from kehl must go to strasbourg before going to frankfurt , which takes three days .
why ca n't things be made simpler ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
kai littmann , president of the civil forum for the euro-district , is optimistic that the idea and the initiatives can work .
" the euro-district is actually the first project where something can change without big risks .
systems that are not working can simply be abolished and replaced .
this is what chirac and schröder wanted : an experimental lab to try out new social structures . " civil projects can ease differences littmann believes that political hurdles in the euro-district can only start to be resolved through the success of civil projects .
from these , a sense of community and euro-district consciousness can be developed .
one such project is the creation of a new completely bilingual school which could open in 2005 . " if we , as one , can think ahead and offer a totally bilingual education , from nursery school to the final leaving exam , in a few years we will have a situation where the majority of the population can express itself in both languages , " said littmann . such a basis , which could be the foundation for a bilingual working environment in the district , could lead to a truly integrated community on the french-german border and an example for other areas which hope to develop closer ties . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

" a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination . " you are aware of the expectations of european citizens ... of the apathy ... of the populist threat from those that want to undermine our union , " he said .
" we have no time to waste .
this is the moment to move on to action . " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : absent , awkward , aimless outgoing eu commission president romano prodi gave his last speech on monday .
while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .

" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal . " in order to consolidate the eu 's defense industry , schröder suggested " standardizing munitions to ease intra-eu arms sales . " european harmony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , schröder upon his arrival at the elysee palace on dec .
9 , 2003 in paris .
his sixth point backed the european commission 's plan to draw up a european contract law as companies who operate across the continent " have to deal with 25 different legal systems . "
finally , schröder suggested harmonizing the way each country assesses corporate taxes . schröder was expected to discuss his proposals with french president jacques chirac during a franco-german mini-summit in berlin on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

they also criticized as inadequate proposed changes to the pact designed to underpin the euro . ahead of a meeting later tuesday with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder told a news conference that they would vote for ankara to be invited to eu membership talks at a summit in december in brussels . " we are both of the opinion that on december 17 it is about a decision that should give turkey the opportunity to negotiate with the -lrb- european -rrb- commission with the explicit aim of turkey joining the european union and with no other aim , " schröder told reporters . chirac added that it was his " dearest wish " that turkey 's membership talks with the eu end in its joining the bloc . " this decision -lrb- in december -rrb- is based on the recommendations of the european commission , whose favorable conclusion we know and i agree with too , " he said .
" however , there will then be a long-term process of negotiations , which could last 15 years .

turkey has said it wants the talks to start in early 2005 . chirac told reporters he believed the negotiations could begin " in 2005 or around 2005 . "
" the membership of turkey would be in the interest of turkey and in the interest of the stability and democracy of the world and our region , " he said . erdogan warned before leaving for berlin tuesday that his poor , predominantly muslim country would settle for nothing short of full membership in the eu , regardless of efforts within the bloc to slow the process . " this summit ... is very important with respect to our foreign policy objectives because turkey 's european union accession process has ceased to be an ambiguous process for the eu and has taken an irreversible direction , " erdogan said in a speech before the parliamentary group of his justice and development party . stability pact changes " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , home of the european central bank schröder and chirac also discussed proposed changes to the european union 's stability and growth pact - which underpins the euro .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . while the franco-german relationship often throws up little spats , as a close partnership is wont to do from time to time , the cooperation between two of europe 's main players remains one of the strongest on the continent . nearly two years after chancellor gerhard schröder and president jacques chirac celebrated the 40th anniversary of the reconciliation between the two countries , the relationship has blossomed further with the introduction of many innovative initiatives designed to bring france and germany even closer together at the heart of europe . one of these , the german-french council of ministers , the combined parliamentary group established to achieve more political transparency and cooperation , meets for the fourth time in berlin on tuesday . but the development in relations does not end with closer political ties between the bundestag and the elysee palace .
schröder and chirac had closer ties at grass roots in mind when they met amid the euphoric atmosphere of last january 's anniversary celebrations . they set in motion a project to create a european district involving the towns of strasbourg and kehl on the franco-german border which would be a real test case for european integration .
one and half years on , the little-known project is a microcosm of the larger relationship , with all its successes and failures . cross-cultural education the saint etienne elementary school in the heart of strasbourg has been promoting franco-german relations for ten years now and was chosen as the focus point of the initiative .
pupils have language lessons in french and german and other subjects investigate cultural differences and shared history .
it is a model that is unique in europe , something head mistress isabelle schuler is very proud of . " there is not only a linguistic background at this school , but also a cultural one , " she told deutsche welle .
" we celebrate , for example , saint martin 's day festival which is very important in germany .
we try and introduce the children into the culture : we make lanterns and practice the saint martin 's songs .

the children of saint etienne come from strasbourg and kehl , a community of young french and germans growing up in a european sphere .
the spirit of community is helped by the fact that the french town of strasbourg and the german town of kehl are only separated by a bridge . the school is seen as a model for further cultural exchange projects along the french-german border .
the leaders of both countries are very keen to develop further initiatives which can promote the international collaboration .
but while the project is unique and offers hope to those wanting closer ties , there will always be problems . not all smooth sailing " there have been misunderstandings , " explained günther petry , the mayor of kehl .

despite wrangling over costs , the show still opened in spring 2004 .
the debate over who should foot the bill still continues . a secret agenda ? there is also a suspicion in kehl 's corridors of power that the proud metropolis of strasbourg may be using the euro-district project to add impetus for an ambitious town development plan which includes the planned construction of a high-speed train route between paris and strasbourg .
there is also not as much cooperation as was hoped . " there is here no information on the job market over there and vice versa , " said petry .
" or questions related to health care .
or why a letter from kehl must go to strasbourg before going to frankfurt , which takes three days .
why ca n't things be made simpler ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
kai littmann , president of the civil forum for the euro-district , is optimistic that the idea and the initiatives can work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.10.2004 gay tv channel hits french airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pink tv officials hope the station will help boost gay rights in france france 's first gay and lesbian television station went on the air monday , ready to beam a steady diet of homosexual porn , daily repeats of " wonder woman " and english language comedies into subscribers ' homes . pink tv , as the channel jointly financed by france 's main existing commercial networks is known , hopes to ride on a wave of acceptance for the gay lifestyle in europe and elsewhere . the station , available via satellite or cable for € 9 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- a month , follows the launch of similar ventures in italy and canada over the past three years , and comes just five months ahead of yet another such channel in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand charpentier -lrb- r -rrb- and stephane chapin -lrb- l -rrb- married in june , but the union is illegal under french law .
long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .

" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal . " in order to consolidate the eu 's defense industry , schröder suggested " standardizing munitions to ease intra-eu arms sales . " european harmony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , schröder upon his arrival at the elysee palace on dec .

his sixth point backed the european commission 's plan to draw up a european contract law as companies who operate across the continent " have to deal with 25 different legal systems . "
finally , schröder suggested harmonizing the way each country assesses corporate taxes . schröder was expected to discuss his proposals with french president jacques chirac during a franco-german mini-summit in berlin on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc restoration stops on shredded stasi files the mammoth jigsaw puzzle that is the shredded stasi files will not be completed , the german government said on monday , due to increasing costs .
the reassembling of files from former east germany 's secret police , torn to shreds in the chaos leading up to the fall of communism in the soviet union and the 1990 reunification of germany , would cost the government a further € 50 million -lrb- $ 63.9 million -rrb- , on top of the sums already spent , to buy the advanced machines needed to complete the restoration .
the advanced computer reconstruction systems would be able to restore the 16,000 sacks of shredded stasi files in just five years , experts say , but the spiraling costs have brought the dreams of many to a premature end .
victims of the once-feared stasi are allowed access to their files and many had hoped the restored files would help them find out who had spied on them during the communist era .
government officials have vowed that all shredded files would be maintained and that if funds became available , the program to complete reconstructing the much-feared stasi 's files could be restarted . dw-world.de former dictatorships hoping to learn from german stasi archive berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts .

i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence .

" a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination . " you are aware of the expectations of european citizens ... of the apathy ... of the populist threat from those that want to undermine our union , " he said .
" we have no time to waste .
this is the moment to move on to action . " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : absent , awkward , aimless outgoing eu commission president romano prodi gave his last speech on monday .

cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . while the franco-german relationship often throws up little spats , as a close partnership is wont to do from time to time , the cooperation between two of europe 's main players remains one of the strongest on the continent . nearly two years after chancellor gerhard schröder and president jacques chirac celebrated the 40th anniversary of the reconciliation between the two countries , the relationship has blossomed further with the introduction of many innovative initiatives designed to bring france and germany even closer together at the heart of europe . one of these , the german-french council of ministers , the combined parliamentary group established to achieve more political transparency and cooperation , meets for the fourth time in berlin on tuesday . but the development in relations does not end with closer political ties between the bundestag and the elysee palace .
schröder and chirac had closer ties at grass roots in mind when they met amid the euphoric atmosphere of last january 's anniversary celebrations . they set in motion a project to create a european district involving the towns of strasbourg and kehl on the franco-german border which would be a real test case for european integration .

despite wrangling over costs , the show still opened in spring 2004 .
the debate over who should foot the bill still continues . a secret agenda ? there is also a suspicion in kehl 's corridors of power that the proud metropolis of strasbourg may be using the euro-district project to add impetus for an ambitious town development plan which includes the planned construction of a high-speed train route between paris and strasbourg .

in an interview with dw-world , he stressed that the museum had a healthy awareness of its social role . " we 've set up an art school for children , for example , because we want to make sure we maintain a bridge to the community , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.10.2004 the cross-border collaboration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pierre pflimlin bridge brings strasbourg and kehl closer together in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . while the franco-german relationship often throws up little spats , as a close partnership is wont to do from time to time , the cooperation between two of europe 's main players remains one of the strongest on the continent . nearly two years after chancellor gerhard schröder and president jacques chirac celebrated the 40th anniversary of the reconciliation between the two countries , the relationship has blossomed further with the introduction of many innovative initiatives designed to bring france and germany even closer together at the heart of europe . one of these , the german-french council of ministers , the combined parliamentary group established to achieve more political transparency and cooperation , meets for the fourth time in berlin on tuesday . but the development in relations does not end with closer political ties between the bundestag and the elysee palace .
schröder and chirac had closer ties at grass roots in mind when they met amid the euphoric atmosphere of last january 's anniversary celebrations . they set in motion a project to create a european district involving the towns of strasbourg and kehl on the franco-german border which would be a real test case for european integration .
one and half years on , the little-known project is a microcosm of the larger relationship , with all its successes and failures . cross-cultural education the saint etienne elementary school in the heart of strasbourg has been promoting franco-german relations for ten years now and was chosen as the focus point of the initiative .
pupils have language lessons in french and german and other subjects investigate cultural differences and shared history .
it is a model that is unique in europe , something head mistress isabelle schuler is very proud of . " there is not only a linguistic background at this school , but also a cultural one , " she told deutsche welle .
" we celebrate , for example , saint martin 's day festival which is very important in germany .
we try and introduce the children into the culture : we make lanterns and practice the saint martin 's songs .
the families are invited , of course , and then we have parents and grandparents - and all singing together .
everyone is involved in experiencing the importance of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children of the euro-district travel and learn together .
the children of saint etienne come from strasbourg and kehl , a community of young french and germans growing up in a european sphere .
the spirit of community is helped by the fact that the french town of strasbourg and the german town of kehl are only separated by a bridge . the school is seen as a model for further cultural exchange projects along the french-german border .
the leaders of both countries are very keen to develop further initiatives which can promote the international collaboration .
but while the project is unique and offers hope to those wanting closer ties , there will always be problems . not all smooth sailing " there have been misunderstandings , " explained günther petry , the mayor of kehl .
" but this is completely natural when members of two different cultures so closely cooperate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a collaboration in law enforcement between french and german police in the district highlighted problems .
things do not always run smoothly .
after a change in the power structure in kehl 's town hall , which saw a conservative majority take charge , cooperative events between the french and the germans have sometimes been a cause of friction at political , judicial and social levels . the landmark german french garden show , one of the biggest international projects undertaken between the towns , almost did n't happen .
despite wrangling over costs , the show still opened in spring 2004 .
the debate over who should foot the bill still continues . a secret agenda ? there is also a suspicion in kehl 's corridors of power that the proud metropolis of strasbourg may be using the euro-district project to add impetus for an ambitious town development plan which includes the planned construction of a high-speed train route between paris and strasbourg .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous . "
thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others . " one of the biggest names in women 's tennis , amelie mauresmo , openly gay paris mayor delanoe and actresses line renaud - the party host - , claudia cardinale and nathalie baye were among the many guests , some of them wearing fancy dresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elton john in a recorded message shown on a large screen british singer elton john wished the network well and sang a few lines from gay anthem " la vie en rose .

he has announced that french voters will vote on the matter . before that happens , however , eu leaders at a summit in december are supposed to lay out turkey 's prospects of joining the bloc , either setting a date for accession talks to begin or proposing an alternative relationship to the country . erdogan will also oversee the final signature on state-run turkish airlines ' contract to buy 36 airbus planes worth $ 2.8 billion -lrb- € 2.19 billion -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mending the franco-german industrial rift french finance minister nicolas sarkozy meets with counterpart wolfgang clement in berlin on monday in an attempt to heal the recent rifts in franco-german industrial relations with plans for a shipbuilding alliance .

he has announced that french voters will vote on the matter . before that happens , however , eu leaders at a summit in december are supposed to lay out turkey 's prospects of joining the bloc , either setting a date for accession talks to begin or proposing an alternative relationship to the country . erdogan will also oversee the final signature on state-run turkish airlines ' contract to buy 36 airbus planes worth $ 2.8 billion -lrb- € 2.19 billion -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mending the franco-german industrial rift french finance minister nicolas sarkozy meets with counterpart wolfgang clement in berlin on monday in an attempt to heal the recent rifts in franco-german industrial relations with plans for a shipbuilding alliance .

it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .

but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .

" a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination . " you are aware of the expectations of european citizens ... of the apathy ... of the populist threat from those that want to undermine our union , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.10.2004 opinion : absent , awkward , aimless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say prodi did n't deliver a stellar performance outgoing eu commission president romano prodi gave his last speech on monday .
while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .
to take an example , prodi refused to back down in the matter of bse-infected meat and won the fight against states that had argued for laxer rules . # b # the 65-year-old is now hoping to return to the circle of heads of state , many of whom often gave him the cold shoulder over the last few years .
italian voters will be the ones to decide whether he returns to national politics in 2006 .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .
to take an example , prodi refused to back down in the matter of bse-infected meat and won the fight against states that had argued for laxer rules . # b # the 65-year-old is now hoping to return to the circle of heads of state , many of whom often gave him the cold shoulder over the last few years .
italian voters will be the ones to decide whether he returns to national politics in 2006 .
in brussels , however , people view this outgoing commission as a good one , with a mediocre , weak president at the helm . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fate of incoming eu commission still uncertain eu commission president prodi indicated friday that his team was prepared for an extension of its term as the crisis over incoming president barroso 's choice of commissioners continued to rage in brussels .

" suite francaise " was written in 1942 as irene nemirovsky waited in rural france for what she knew was her imminent arrest and deportation .
it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .
in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .
she and her sister , who is now dead , then waited another quarter of a century before finally deciding to publish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers occupied paris in june 1940 .
" suite francaise " consists of a first section , entitled " june storm , " which recounts the tangled stories of several families forced to flee northern france as the invading germans approach .
the pettiness and cruelty of the population is mercilessly exposed , as suffering rips away the veneer of respectability . in part two - " dolce " - nemirovsky examines the compromises and moral confusion that ensue when a village is occupied by german soldiers . now aged 74 , denise epstein says the book is not just a novel .
" above all it is a log-book written by my mother through the dark years .
all the people she writes about and takes such pains to create - we knew them .
all the situations - we lived through them , " she said . " during the 1930s my mother wanted to believe that france would defend the jews .
afterwards she was for years seen just as a victim and her talent was forgotten .

they also criticized as inadequate proposed changes to the pact designed to underpin the euro . ahead of a meeting later tuesday with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder told a news conference that they would vote for ankara to be invited to eu membership talks at a summit in december in brussels . " we are both of the opinion that on december 17 it is about a decision that should give turkey the opportunity to negotiate with the -lrb- european -rrb- commission with the explicit aim of turkey joining the european union and with no other aim , " schröder told reporters . chirac added that it was his " dearest wish " that turkey 's membership talks with the eu end in its joining the bloc . " this decision -lrb- in december -rrb- is based on the recommendations of the european commission , whose favorable conclusion we know and i agree with too , " he said .
" however , there will then be a long-term process of negotiations , which could last 15 years . " schröder has been perhaps the strongest supporter of turkey 's bid within the bloc , while chirac has bowed to domestic pressure for a referendum on ankara 's accession and warned that paris could veto membership talks at any time . talks could begin in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey wants to start official talks to join the eu next year the 25 eu leaders are expected at the december summit to give turkey their green light on starting accession talks , but it is not yet clear when the negotiations could start .
turkey has said it wants the talks to start in early 2005 . chirac told reporters he believed the negotiations could begin " in 2005 or around 2005 . "
" the membership of turkey would be in the interest of turkey and in the interest of the stability and democracy of the world and our region , " he said . erdogan warned before leaving for berlin tuesday that his poor , predominantly muslim country would settle for nothing short of full membership in the eu , regardless of efforts within the bloc to slow the process . " this summit ... is very important with respect to our foreign policy objectives because turkey 's european union accession process has ceased to be an ambiguous process for the eu and has taken an irreversible direction , " erdogan said in a speech before the parliamentary group of his justice and development party . stability pact changes " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , home of the european central bank schröder and chirac also discussed proposed changes to the european union 's stability and growth pact - which underpins the euro .
the german leader told reporters that both men believe the proposals are inadequate . " we share the view that -lrb- commission chief romano -rrb- prodi made some interesting propositions , that the propositions point in the right direction , but that they 're not enough , " schröder said at the joint news conference with chirac . paris and berlin wanted to convince their partners in the 12-country euro zone to " allow member states more room for manoeuvre , for example , with regard to investment in research and development , " schröder said . the stability pact , drawn up in 1997 largely at germany 's behest , has become a source of controversy as a growing number of countries fail to respect a rule which limits public deficits to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- on pain of stiff financial penalties . at the beginning of september , the eu commission suggested the rules of the pact could be applied more flexibly and that greater account could be taken of a country 's specific situation if it runs up an excessive deficit . the stability pact was effectively suspended last year when germany and france , the two largest euro-zone economies , persuaded the eu to hold off from imposing disciplinary measures despite their repeated violation of the rules . afp / dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .
" it can highlight that gays are just another part of society with their own interests . " but piriou added that he did n't expect pink tv to play a major role in the promotion of gay rights . " promoting -lrb- gay marriage -rrb- on the gay channel - to ourselves basically - does n't really serve this interest , " he said , adding that the wider french population had to be won over . sex plays big part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late french president francois mitterand and former german chancellor helmut kohl hold hands during a historic meeting in 1984 at a soldier 's cemetary in verdun , a major battleground during world war i. underlining its readiness to make waves , the station published an ad using a picture of former leaders francois mitterrand of france and helmut kohl of germany walking hand-in-hand with the tag " there 's not only sex in the life of a couple . " but sex plays a big part in pink tv 's programing schedule .
four times a week after midnight - on tuesdays and weekends - the station will screen gay porn movies , starting with " out of athens " and later including lesbian features such as " madame and eve . " the station 's head , pascal houzelot , justified the decision to show porn by saying that this was a common practice among pay-tv channels . " i do n't have a problem with that at all , " houzelot told reporters .
" sexuality is part of life and tv aims to mirror life .
why should n't we show sex ? " the first broadcast monday evening was a 45-minute magazine program about gay lifestyle and culture . " pink tv is a meeting place for gay and gay-friendly people who have been waiting for a new perspective on the world around us , " said the channel 's head , pascal houzelot .
" i chose the palais de chaillot -lrb- as a venue for the launch party -rrb- because it is dedicated to human rights . " houzelot said he had dedicated the evening to those " homosexuals who were deported to -lrb- nazi -rrb- concentration camps , " to alexander the great and julius cesar , to french writer marcel proust , and to hollywood icons marlene dietrich and greta garbo . no ghetto outlet the chief executive - who spent time working for chirac before the latter became president , and who was an advisor to leading commercial network tf1 - has said the station does not want to be a " ghetto " outlet for homosexuals only . in a bid to attract a wider audience - but one keyed in to the urban and ironic humour favored in much of the homosexual community - pink tv is to present a number of shows with wide appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay icons : jennifer saunders and joanna lumley as edina monsoon and patsy stone in the tv series " absolutely fabulous .

thus " wonder woman " , the 1970s us series starring lynda carter , has been pressed into service on a nightly basis , and british comedies such as " french and saunders " and us productions like " queer as folk " and " metrosexuality " will also feature . there will also be documentaries starting with the late pop singer freddy mercury and aids as subjects but also venturing farther afield . sports coverage , fittingly enough , will be handled by a tall transsexual in heels and a skirt , known as brigitte boreale . the channel aims to sign up 180,000 subscribers within two years , but houzelot said it would initially be " very happy " with 5,000 to 10,000 to start with . one newspaper , le parisien , said the channel showed there was a " homo wave " sweeping france and quoted houzelot as saying he estimated around 3.5 million people out of the country 's population of 60 million were gay . la vie en rose more than 2,500 guests , including personalities from the world of films , television , sports and politics , attended the launch party opposite the eiffel tower at paris ' palais de chaillot museum , illuminated in pink inside and out for the occasion . the launch " marks an evolution in france , proving that people are ready to accept this type of channel , " former prime minister and presidential hopeful laurent fabius , a socialist , said at the party . culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres , a member of president jacques chirac 's conservative ump party , said pink tv should offer " a big space of freedom and culture to allow all people to live freely and respect others .

long-standing tolerance in paris - reinforced under socialist mayor bertrand delanoe - and the recent court approval for france 's first homosexual family headed by two lesbians , along with a debate over gay marriages triggered by the june wedding of two men , have all convinced pink tv 's backers the time is right for their niche offering . gay rights activists said the channel could play a role in making homosexuality more acceptable in a country where the current conservative government has come out in opposition to legalizing gay marriage or allowing gay people to adopt children . " the gay channel helps to show homosexuality is something normal , which is a good thing , " alain piriou from the inter-lgbt gay rights group told reuters news service .

cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . while the franco-german relationship often throws up little spats , as a close partnership is wont to do from time to time , the cooperation between two of europe 's main players remains one of the strongest on the continent . nearly two years after chancellor gerhard schröder and president jacques chirac celebrated the 40th anniversary of the reconciliation between the two countries , the relationship has blossomed further with the introduction of many innovative initiatives designed to bring france and germany even closer together at the heart of europe . one of these , the german-french council of ministers , the combined parliamentary group established to achieve more political transparency and cooperation , meets for the fourth time in berlin on tuesday . but the development in relations does not end with closer political ties between the bundestag and the elysee palace .
schröder and chirac had closer ties at grass roots in mind when they met amid the euphoric atmosphere of last january 's anniversary celebrations . they set in motion a project to create a european district involving the towns of strasbourg and kehl on the franco-german border which would be a real test case for european integration .
one and half years on , the little-known project is a microcosm of the larger relationship , with all its successes and failures . cross-cultural education the saint etienne elementary school in the heart of strasbourg has been promoting franco-german relations for ten years now and was chosen as the focus point of the initiative .
pupils have language lessons in french and german and other subjects investigate cultural differences and shared history .
it is a model that is unique in europe , something head mistress isabelle schuler is very proud of . " there is not only a linguistic background at this school , but also a cultural one , " she told deutsche welle .
" we celebrate , for example , saint martin 's day festival which is very important in germany .
we try and introduce the children into the culture : we make lanterns and practice the saint martin 's songs .
the families are invited , of course , and then we have parents and grandparents - and all singing together .
everyone is involved in experiencing the importance of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children of the euro-district travel and learn together .
the children of saint etienne come from strasbourg and kehl , a community of young french and germans growing up in a european sphere .
the spirit of community is helped by the fact that the french town of strasbourg and the german town of kehl are only separated by a bridge . the school is seen as a model for further cultural exchange projects along the french-german border .
the leaders of both countries are very keen to develop further initiatives which can promote the international collaboration .
but while the project is unique and offers hope to those wanting closer ties , there will always be problems . not all smooth sailing " there have been misunderstandings , " explained günther petry , the mayor of kehl .
" but this is completely natural when members of two different cultures so closely cooperate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a collaboration in law enforcement between french and german police in the district highlighted problems .
things do not always run smoothly .
after a change in the power structure in kehl 's town hall , which saw a conservative majority take charge , cooperative events between the french and the germans have sometimes been a cause of friction at political , judicial and social levels . the landmark german french garden show , one of the biggest international projects undertaken between the towns , almost did n't happen .
despite wrangling over costs , the show still opened in spring 2004 .
the debate over who should foot the bill still continues . a secret agenda ? there is also a suspicion in kehl 's corridors of power that the proud metropolis of strasbourg may be using the euro-district project to add impetus for an ambitious town development plan which includes the planned construction of a high-speed train route between paris and strasbourg .
there is also not as much cooperation as was hoped . " there is here no information on the job market over there and vice versa , " said petry .
" or questions related to health care .
or why a letter from kehl must go to strasbourg before going to frankfurt , which takes three days .
why ca n't things be made simpler ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
kai littmann , president of the civil forum for the euro-district , is optimistic that the idea and the initiatives can work .
" the euro-district is actually the first project where something can change without big risks .
systems that are not working can simply be abolished and replaced .
this is what chirac and schröder wanted : an experimental lab to try out new social structures . " civil projects can ease differences littmann believes that political hurdles in the euro-district can only start to be resolved through the success of civil projects .
from these , a sense of community and euro-district consciousness can be developed .
one such project is the creation of a new completely bilingual school which could open in 2005 . " if we , as one , can think ahead and offer a totally bilingual education , from nursery school to the final leaving exam , in a few years we will have a situation where the majority of the population can express itself in both languages , " said littmann . such a basis , which could be the foundation for a bilingual working environment in the district , could lead to a truly integrated community on the french-german border and an example for other areas which hope to develop closer ties . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .

but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .

while the italian can look back on some major successes , he has been a mediocre and weak leader , says dw 's bernd riegert . during the last months of his term in office , prodi sometimes seemed strangely absent , awkward and aimless : the moderate , leftist politician , who came to brussels in 1999 after resigning as italian premier , has for a long time been bidding his internal farewell .
prodi is looking forward to a new challenge in 2006 : taking his old job from his arch-rival , italian premier silvio berlusconi . prodi is frustrated as he leaves his position at the eu 's steering wheel , especially since the bloc 's heads of state and government torpedoed his ambitious lisbon agenda . an economics professor by trade , prodi had hoped for the eu to catch up with us economic and innovative strength by the end of the decade .
but national governments often blocked plans to shift decisions about economic policy to brussels .
prodi especially saw german chancellor gerhard schröder as a brakesman . technocrat vs. president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder during a visit to verona in august 2003 schröder himself wanted to see a technocrat in the eu 's top position - someone who could competently lead the union 's 17,000 civil servants .
but prodi did n't just see himself as an administrative director but also as a political president who stimulates discussions and helps shape the eu 's future direction .
he did n't live up to this role . holding the rotating eu presidency in 1999 , schröder had actually helped to bring prodi into office .
it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .
he tried several times to regain power , but never really managed to do so . shared success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi and verheugen on oct .
6 , the day the commission recommended membership talks with turkey the italian 's time in brussels did include several highlights - first and foremost the successful eu enlargement in may as well as the recommendation to commence membership negotiations with turkey .
in both cases , however , prodi owes a great debt to one of his strongest commissioners , germany 's günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- . the eu 's far-reaching agricultural reform was also spearheaded by an able commissioner - austria 's franz fischler - and not prodi himself .
the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .
in 2002 , prodi stabbed his own monetary commissioner in the back by saying that the pact was inflexible and therefore " stupid . " following jacques santer , who had been forced to resign after financial and corruption scandals , prodi tried to return the commission to order .
he pushed through a number of institutional reforms and created olaf , the eu body now in charge of fighting corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi hopes to unseat his arch-rival , italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , in national elections in 2006 .
all of this still has n't made the bloc 's books completely transparent ; that will hopefully change with the new commission , where the finance and financial control dossiers will be handled separately by two commissioners . comeback in 2006 ? the european commission , which has increasingly received more power , has suggested a record number of laws over the last five years .
the group dared much when it came to questions of monopoly and internal competition .
while some complain about over-regulation , consumers profited .
to take an example , prodi refused to back down in the matter of bse-infected meat and won the fight against states that had argued for laxer rules . # b # the 65-year-old is now hoping to return to the circle of heads of state , many of whom often gave him the cold shoulder over the last few years .
italian voters will be the ones to decide whether he returns to national politics in 2006 .

it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .

the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .

it was a fundamental miscalculation : while prodi had spent three years preparing italy for the euro with harsh spending cuts , he failed to show similar leadership qualities after his move to brussels . in a 2000 keynote speech , prodi already lamented the slow pace at which the then 15 governments were moving , as well as the fact that member states often made decisions without considering the views of the european commission .

the introduction of the euro equally became a success story , but its foundations had been laid long before prodi 's tenure . prodi 's commission has bravely defended the euro zone 's growth and stability pact and even won cases before the european court of justice .
but in the end , brussels had to give in to the political will of the union 's finance ministers .

" suite francaise " was written in 1942 as irene nemirovsky waited in rural france for what she knew was her imminent arrest and deportation .
it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .
in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .
she and her sister , who is now dead , then waited another quarter of a century before finally deciding to publish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers occupied paris in june 1940 .
" suite francaise " consists of a first section , entitled " june storm , " which recounts the tangled stories of several families forced to flee northern france as the invading germans approach .
the pettiness and cruelty of the population is mercilessly exposed , as suffering rips away the veneer of respectability . in part two - " dolce " - nemirovsky examines the compromises and moral confusion that ensue when a village is occupied by german soldiers . now aged 74 , denise epstein says the book is not just a novel .
" above all it is a log-book written by my mother through the dark years .
all the people she writes about and takes such pains to create - we knew them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.10.2004 the cross-border collaboration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pierre pflimlin bridge brings strasbourg and kehl closer together in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . while the franco-german relationship often throws up little spats , as a close partnership is wont to do from time to time , the cooperation between two of europe 's main players remains one of the strongest on the continent . nearly two years after chancellor gerhard schröder and president jacques chirac celebrated the 40th anniversary of the reconciliation between the two countries , the relationship has blossomed further with the introduction of many innovative initiatives designed to bring france and germany even closer together at the heart of europe . one of these , the german-french council of ministers , the combined parliamentary group established to achieve more political transparency and cooperation , meets for the fourth time in berlin on tuesday . but the development in relations does not end with closer political ties between the bundestag and the elysee palace .
schröder and chirac had closer ties at grass roots in mind when they met amid the euphoric atmosphere of last january 's anniversary celebrations . they set in motion a project to create a european district involving the towns of strasbourg and kehl on the franco-german border which would be a real test case for european integration .
one and half years on , the little-known project is a microcosm of the larger relationship , with all its successes and failures . cross-cultural education the saint etienne elementary school in the heart of strasbourg has been promoting franco-german relations for ten years now and was chosen as the focus point of the initiative .
pupils have language lessons in french and german and other subjects investigate cultural differences and shared history .
it is a model that is unique in europe , something head mistress isabelle schuler is very proud of . " there is not only a linguistic background at this school , but also a cultural one , " she told deutsche welle .
" we celebrate , for example , saint martin 's day festival which is very important in germany .
we try and introduce the children into the culture : we make lanterns and practice the saint martin 's songs .
the families are invited , of course , and then we have parents and grandparents - and all singing together .
everyone is involved in experiencing the importance of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children of the euro-district travel and learn together .
the children of saint etienne come from strasbourg and kehl , a community of young french and germans growing up in a european sphere .
the spirit of community is helped by the fact that the french town of strasbourg and the german town of kehl are only separated by a bridge . the school is seen as a model for further cultural exchange projects along the french-german border .
the leaders of both countries are very keen to develop further initiatives which can promote the international collaboration .
but while the project is unique and offers hope to those wanting closer ties , there will always be problems . not all smooth sailing " there have been misunderstandings , " explained günther petry , the mayor of kehl .
" but this is completely natural when members of two different cultures so closely cooperate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a collaboration in law enforcement between french and german police in the district highlighted problems .
things do not always run smoothly .
after a change in the power structure in kehl 's town hall , which saw a conservative majority take charge , cooperative events between the french and the germans have sometimes been a cause of friction at political , judicial and social levels . the landmark german french garden show , one of the biggest international projects undertaken between the towns , almost did n't happen .
despite wrangling over costs , the show still opened in spring 2004 .
the debate over who should foot the bill still continues . a secret agenda ? there is also a suspicion in kehl 's corridors of power that the proud metropolis of strasbourg may be using the euro-district project to add impetus for an ambitious town development plan which includes the planned construction of a high-speed train route between paris and strasbourg .
there is also not as much cooperation as was hoped . " there is here no information on the job market over there and vice versa , " said petry .
" or questions related to health care .
or why a letter from kehl must go to strasbourg before going to frankfurt , which takes three days .
why ca n't things be made simpler ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac .
kai littmann , president of the civil forum for the euro-district , is optimistic that the idea and the initiatives can work .
" the euro-district is actually the first project where something can change without big risks .
systems that are not working can simply be abolished and replaced .
this is what chirac and schröder wanted : an experimental lab to try out new social structures . " civil projects can ease differences littmann believes that political hurdles in the euro-district can only start to be resolved through the success of civil projects .
from these , a sense of community and euro-district consciousness can be developed .
one such project is the creation of a new completely bilingual school which could open in 2005 . " if we , as one , can think ahead and offer a totally bilingual education , from nursery school to the final leaving exam , in a few years we will have a situation where the majority of the population can express itself in both languages , " said littmann . such a basis , which could be the foundation for a bilingual working environment in the district , could lead to a truly integrated community on the french-german border and an example for other areas which hope to develop closer ties . andreas noll -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

heads of state will have to try to resolve the issue in brussels . britain retains opt-out earlier britain said it backed eu efforts to boost cooperation on immigration and asylum policy but must retain a right to opt out of decisions which threaten its interests . " we -lrb- are -rrb- clearly all in this together because people move through the new borders of eastern and central europe , " said british home secretary david blunkett .
" so it is in our interest to get agreement about sensible border controls run by the countries themselves but supported by the rest of europe . " immigration has become a hot political issue in britain as the government has sought to beat back popular fears of a flood of asylum-seekers and economic migrants from an enlarged eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair wants the best of both worlds for his country at his monthly news conference in london , british prime minister tony blair said there was no question of britain giving up its veto on border controls . " we are not obliged to have any of the european rules here , " he said .
" but where we decide in a particular area - for example to halt the trafficking in people , for example to make sure that there are proper restrictions on some of the european borders that end up affecting our country - it allows us to opt in and take part in these measures . " " with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago , we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe , " blair said .
" unless we opt in we are not affected by it .
and what this actually gives us is the best of both worlds . " at the luxembourg meeting france and germany opposed any specific reference to legal immigration quotas , as pressed for by spain and italy . on the issue of asylum britain , germany and portugal expressed doubts about moving to a common policy by 2010 , preferring to wait and see how recently adopted common standards for accepting asylum seekers and examining their requests were working out . no agreement on asylum centers the idea of setting up centers for asylum seekers in north africa , as advocated by germany and italy , failed to win general backing . but there was agreement on the need to work with the countries of origin of the seekers and with those through which they transited , with the aim of stopping them from trying to cross the mediterranean . the eu wants to keep them in protected zones near countries in turmoil , help north african states take them in and write provisions about the return of illegal immigrants into association agreements . afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to tackle asylum and security policy eu justice and interior ministers on monday will discuss the future policy course on a wide-ranging security and immigration program that includes controversial proposals for refugee detention camps in africa .

according to sources , barroso may offer to bring forward new general legislation on anti-discrimination and offer other concessions to meps who want the parliament to be taken more seriously .
barroso is also considering , say insiders , whether to say that any more statements of this nature by buttiglione will result in the latter 's resignation .
but what is remains unclear is whether such concession would be enough to swing a majority in favor of barroso on wednesday .
if meps vote down the commission on wednesday , it will plunge the eu into a political crisis as it will be left without an executive - just before the symbolically important signing of the constitutional treaty on friday .
it will also shift the nature of the balance of power between the institutions in the eu as it will be the first time that the member states ’ right to send whoever they want to brussels has been so directly and publicly challenged .
if the commission does get voted in on wednesday , it is expected that it will only be with a very narrow majority - getting the new barroso commission off to a very tough start from which it will be difficult to recover .
moreover , for some meps , a positive vote would mean a missed chance for the parliament to really exercise its democratic power .
for his part , barroso said he hoped that the eu " can avoid any kind of power vacuum . "

according to sources , barroso may offer to bring forward new general legislation on anti-discrimination and offer other concessions to meps who want the parliament to be taken more seriously .
barroso is also considering , say insiders , whether to say that any more statements of this nature by buttiglione will result in the latter 's resignation .
but what is remains unclear is whether such concession would be enough to swing a majority in favor of barroso on wednesday .
if meps vote down the commission on wednesday , it will plunge the eu into a political crisis as it will be left without an executive - just before the symbolically important signing of the constitutional treaty on friday .
it will also shift the nature of the balance of power between the institutions in the eu as it will be the first time that the member states ’ right to send whoever they want to brussels has been so directly and publicly challenged .
if the commission does get voted in on wednesday , it is expected that it will only be with a very narrow majority - getting the new barroso commission off to a very tough start from which it will be difficult to recover .
moreover , for some meps , a positive vote would mean a missed chance for the parliament to really exercise its democratic power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.10.2004 barroso battles to avoid veto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still hoping to get approval : buttiglione -lrb- left -rrb- and barroso incoming european commission chief jose barroso rejected tuesday calls to reshuffle his new team , as demanded by eu lawmakers threatening to veto the eu executive in a crunch vote . battling to avoid an eu crisis days before the commission is due to take office , barroso called on the european parliament to show " responsibility " and back him in what looks set to be a knife-edge ballot on wednesday . " a reshuffle would create more institutional and political problems than it would resolve , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg , in a debate which is due to be followed by the vote on wednesday . " this commission team is worthy of your trust , " he added .
" i appeal to your sense of responsibility .
i appeal above all to your european identity ... and ask you to give the commission your confidence . " socialists and others in the 732-member eu assembly have threatened to reject the incoming commission led by jose barroso in particular over controversial italian eu justice commissioner-designate rocco buttiglione . the conservative catholic - who was in the eu assembly for tuesday 's debate along with all the other members of barroso 's new team - sparked a storm last month by saying that homosexuality is a sin and that women 's place is to have children and be protected by their husbands . to placate buttiglioni 's opponents , barroso has vowed to create a new fundamental rights agency to right racial and sexual prejudice and to draft eu legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation . but the parliamentary arithmetic is too close to call .
only the conservative european people 's party , which holds 268 seats , backs the barroso commission . liberal vote decisive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament building in strasbourg analysts say that the outcome could depend crucially on the centrist liberals , whose leader graham watson has called for buttiglione to be reshuffled but whose 88 members are believed to be divided . watson reiterated his hardline at tuesday 's parliamentary session . " we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go . " it will be a close vote , " he added . prodi willing to stay on current commission chief romano prodi has confirmed that , if barroso fails to win the parliament 's backing before nov .
1 - when he is due to take office - he could continue as a caretaker until the row is resolved . it is unclear what exactly would happen in case of a " no " vote . eu officials have repeatedly rebuffed questions by reiterating their hopes that the barroso team will win approval . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso addressing eu parliamentarians in july in his strasbourg address barroso reaffirmed a compromise proposal made last week to transfer some of buttiglione 's more sensitive powers to a committee of fellow commissioners . he also announced that he will create an eu agency on fundamental rights , as well as launch an " action plan " against all forms of discrimination .

" we will not change our principles against our consciences for political convenience , " he said , citing buttiglione 's own justification for standing by his views on homosexuality . the head of the socialists meanwhile also restated his group 's intention to reject the incoming commission unless it is reshuffled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german socialist european parliament member martin schulz " if there is not a reshuffle of the commission like we have asked , then we can not approve the commission , " martin schulz told afp , saying it is " very difficult " to forecast how the vote will go .

franz müntefering , the leader of the social democratic spd party , said after a meeting with green leaders on monday that the liberal fdp and the christian democrat cdu / csu opposition parties would be invited for talks over the possible change .
a two-third majority is needed in the parliament and the bundesrat -lrb- second chamber -rrb- to pass the new law , which was not reached when the german government tabled a similar proposal in 2002 .
while the liberal fdp and the bavaria based christian social union are broadly supportive , the larger christian democrat party has expressed strong reservations .
if the new german law is approved , it will break with germany 's 55-year-old rules banning referenda - which were abused in the run up to nazism .
the new bill would enable both citizens ' initiative referenda and referenda called by the government .
according to müntefering 400,000 citizens should also be able to initiate new laws to be presented in the parliament .

the performance of scotland in the world cup qualifying campaign is currently under review .
there will be a further statement in due course . "
the sfa hierarchy held an initial meeting last friday following scotland 's deflating 1-1 draw in moldova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc restoration stops on shredded stasi files the mammoth jigsaw puzzle that is the shredded stasi files will not be completed , the german government said on monday , due to increasing costs .
the reassembling of files from former east germany 's secret police , torn to shreds in the chaos leading up to the fall of communism in the soviet union and the 1990 reunification of germany , would cost the government a further € 50 million -lrb- $ 63.9 million -rrb- , on top of the sums already spent , to buy the advanced machines needed to complete the restoration .

the reassembling of files from former east germany 's secret police , torn to shreds in the chaos leading up to the fall of communism in the soviet union and the 1990 reunification of germany , would cost the government a further € 50 million -lrb- $ 63.9 million -rrb- , on top of the sums already spent , to buy the advanced machines needed to complete the restoration .
the advanced computer reconstruction systems would be able to restore the 16,000 sacks of shredded stasi files in just five years , experts say , but the spiraling costs have brought the dreams of many to a premature end .
victims of the once-feared stasi are allowed access to their files and many had hoped the restored files would help them find out who had spied on them during the communist era .
government officials have vowed that all shredded files would be maintained and that if funds became available , the program to complete reconstructing the much-feared stasi 's files could be restarted . dw-world.de former dictatorships hoping to learn from german stasi archive berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment .

" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment .

" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal .

" at stake is the preservation of the european social model : the broad participation of society in the economy , the wide range of social protections , a fair distribution of goods , and a high degree of environmental safeguards , " schröder wrote .
" from the german perspective , there can only be one answer to the challenge : europe must set clear priorities for more sustainable growth and employment . " schröder 's strong support for the lisbon strategy was in sharp contrast to the outgoing head of the european commission , romano prodi , who was quoted in britain 's financial times on monday as saying that europe 's efforts to catch up to and then outpace the us economy have been " a big failure . " energy and electricity freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens should be able to choose their energy and electricity providers , schröder said .
the key thrust of schröder 's " seven chances for the internal market " is that by mid-2007 all consumers in the enlarged eu - which now represents a market of 450 million people - must be able to freely choose their electricity and energy providers , as has been the case in germany since 1998 .
" this will intensify cross-border competition , benefit consumers and industries by providing cheaper energy and stimulate economic activity across the board , " schröder explained . the german leader talked about the need to ensure the stability and growth of european financial markets and called for consumer banking in europe to be made more efficient , for instance by making money transfers across eu borders faster and cheaper . service industry must be utilized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service sector needs to be fully utilized , according to schröder .
schröder pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in the eu are in the service sector but said the sector " has enormous , and untapped , potential for growth . "
he backed the european commission 's suggestion for a directive on the service industries as the " logical , right and obvious step towards achieving this goal . " in order to consolidate the eu 's defense industry , schröder suggested " standardizing munitions to ease intra-eu arms sales . " european harmony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , schröder upon his arrival at the elysee palace on dec .
9 , 2003 in paris .
his sixth point backed the european commission 's plan to draw up a european contract law as companies who operate across the continent " have to deal with 25 different legal systems . "
finally , schröder suggested harmonizing the way each country assesses corporate taxes . schröder was expected to discuss his proposals with french president jacques chirac during a franco-german mini-summit in berlin on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lynchpin in french , turkish talks chancellor schröder will host the french and turkish leaders in berlin for talks on tuesday that are set to delve into the issues of european economic power and ankara joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.10.2004 auschwitz victim 's novel creates sensation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nemirovsky 's book was published 62 years after she died a lost novel by a once-famous jewish author who was murdered in auschwitz is being hailed as the literary event of the year in france , not least because of the extraordinary story that has finally led to its publication . " suite francaise " was written in 1942 as irene nemirovsky waited in rural france for what she knew was her imminent arrest and deportation .
it is a powerful account of the effect on ordinary people of the military collapse of june 1940 , the panicked flight from paris and the arrival of the german army . described by the publishing magazine livres-hebdo as the " most important novel of the year , " it caused a sensation at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month , where , after fierce bidding , english language rights were snapped up for an undisclosed sum by random house . the novel has even been hailed as a french equivalent of anne frank 's diary because of the rare authenticity with which it treats one of the most painful episodes in the country 's modern history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover of " suite francaise " with a picture of nemirovsky " it could become one of the key books of france under the occupation , " said olivier le naire , literary editor of l 'express magazine .
" you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of works of this force that were written not after the war - but right in the thick of it .
from the literary as well as historic point of view , it is big news - and a masterpiece . " shot to fame in 1929 nemirovsky was born in 1903 into a family of rich russian jews who were forced to emigrate during the revolution .
in paris she studied at the sorbonne and in 1929 shot to fame with her novel " david golder , " which was followed over the next decade by more than 15 others . multilingual and well-connected - she counted jean cocteau among her acquaintances - she led a charmed life , marrying jewish businessman michel epstein and having two daughters , denise and elisabeth .
but with the war all changed . abandoned by her friends and boycotted by the publishing industry for being jewish , she and epstein fled paris in 1941 for the village of issy-l 'eveque in southern burgundy , where in a leather notebook she began to write out what she hoped would be a five-part epic on the aftermath of defeat . on july 13 , 1942 french police called at her home and arrested her .
deported to auschwitz she died there the following month .
her husband wrote to the vichy leader philippe petain asking for his help , but in october he too was arrested and later killed at auschwitz .
novel discovered decades later one of nemirovsky 's last acts before her arrest was to entrust a suitcase containing photographs and family papers to her two daughters , who for two years traveled from safe house to safe house to avoid the attention of the french police . three decades later denise finally summoned up the courage to read the hidden notebook and was astonished to discover that it was not - as she had supposed - a diary , but the first two parts of the novel .
she and her sister , who is now dead , then waited another quarter of a century before finally deciding to publish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers occupied paris in june 1940 .
" suite francaise " consists of a first section , entitled " june storm , " which recounts the tangled stories of several families forced to flee northern france as the invading germans approach .
the pettiness and cruelty of the population is mercilessly exposed , as suffering rips away the veneer of respectability . in part two - " dolce " - nemirovsky examines the compromises and moral confusion that ensue when a village is occupied by german soldiers . now aged 74 , denise epstein says the book is not just a novel .
" above all it is a log-book written by my mother through the dark years .
all the people she writes about and takes such pains to create - we knew them .
all the situations - we lived through them , " she said . " during the 1930s my mother wanted to believe that france would defend the jews .
afterwards she was for years seen just as a victim and her talent was forgotten .
i hope this book will do justice to what she was above all else - a writer .

dollars were made legal tender in 1993 following an economic crisis sparked by the collapse of the soviet union .
but dollars will no longer be accepted in shops and other businesses , and tourists and cubans exchanging dollars will have to pay a 10 % commission .
cuban leader fidel castro appeared on tv to endorse the measure , despite suffering a bad fall last wednesday .
" the empire is determined to create more difficulties for us , " he said , referring to the us .
in may , the us announced it was tightening its embargo on cuba , with measures including capping the remittances sent to the island by cubans in the us .
in response , said the cuban central bank in a statement , dollars would no longer be accepted in shops and businesses .
i recommend you all take care descending the stairs fidel castro , joking about his accident last week they will have to be exchanged for " convertible pesos " - a local currency that can be used in special shops on the island but has no value internationally - for a 10 % charge .
following the economic crash of the 1990s , and the legalisation of the dollar , many cubans have become dependant on dollars for many goods , including some basic necessities .
the cuban government closed down so-called dollar stores in immediate response to the us measures in may , but most reopened two weeks later .
remittances hit mr castro said the measure did not signal the outlawing of the dollar .
cubans will still be allowed to hold an unlimited amount of dollars , and they will be able to exchange them without charge until the new law comes into effect in two weeks .
but it will mean an additional burden on cubans abroad who send remittances in dollars - pumping up to $ 1bn into the cuban economy each year .
in his message , mr castro urged cubans to tell relatives to send money in other currencies , such as euros , british pounds or swiss francs .
our correspondent in havana , stephen gibbs , says this measure will enable it to receive and control far more of the hundreds of millions of dollars that tourists and cubans living abroad bring or send here every year .
it was mr castro 's first public appearance since last wednesday 's fall , when he fractured his knee and right arm .
mr castro , sporting a royal blue sling , joked about the fall in his tv appearance to back the new measure .
" i recommend you all take care descending the stairs , " he said at the end of the broadcast .

cornwall sea fisheries and the cornish fish producers organisation -lrb- cfpo -rrb- have come up with a voluntary code of practice to avoid the problems .
the initiative comes amid concern by fishermen that they have been wrongly blamed for some of the deaths .
more than 300 dolphin and porpoise carcasses were found on beaches in the south west in the year 2002-2003 .
this has to be the way forward paul trebilcock under the code , if cetaceans are seen in areas where fishing is taking place , fishermen will pull their nets and warn other boats in the area .
and if a dolphin or porpoise does appear among the catch , fishermen will in those circumstances stop fishing and alert other boats .

rescue workers are still searching for a further 26 people at the daping mine in henan province , but officials fear they are no longer alive .
the revised toll makes the accident the most deadly of its kind since 2000 .
china 's coal mines are among the world 's most dangerous .
more than 4,000 miners ' lives have been lost so far this year .
coal demands china 's economic boom needs more and more power coal production rising by more than 15 % a year government crackdown on illegal and worst-run mines even so , more than 4,000 people killed in mining accidents so far this year rescue operations have been hindered by a high concentration of gas in the air and debris from the collapsed shaft , the official xinhua news agency has reported .
president hu jintao has called for answers after this latest tragedy , and ordered local officials to " spare no effort " to find the missing miners .
scant hope more than 400 people were working underground at the daping mine near xinmi when the blast happened , spewing out toxic gas and causing part of the mine 's roof to collapse .
official figures released last week showed that 4,153 people had died in mining accidents in china in the first three quarters of this year - a figure 13 % lower than last year 's .
however , the bbc 's correspondent in shanghai , francis markus , says the total may be higher since some deaths go unreported .
these often occur in illegal , unregulated mines , which have mushroomed as china 's industrial revolution drives the country 's huge demand for coal .
mines which are shut down because of poor safety records quickly reopen , our correspondent says .
the accident is now the most costly in terms of human life since 162 people died in a mine blast in guizhou in 2000 .

rescue workers are still searching for a further 26 people at the daping mine in henan province , but officials fear they are no longer alive .
the revised toll makes the accident the most deadly of its kind since 2000 .
china 's coal mines are among the world 's most dangerous .
more than 4,000 miners ' lives have been lost so far this year .
coal demands china 's economic boom needs more and more power coal production rising by more than 15 % a year government crackdown on illegal and worst-run mines even so , more than 4,000 people killed in mining accidents so far this year rescue operations have been hindered by a high concentration of gas in the air and debris from the collapsed shaft , the official xinhua news agency has reported .
president hu jintao has called for answers after this latest tragedy , and ordered local officials to " spare no effort " to find the missing miners .
scant hope more than 400 people were working underground at the daping mine near xinmi when the blast happened , spewing out toxic gas and causing part of the mine 's roof to collapse .
official figures released last week showed that 4,153 people had died in mining accidents in china in the first three quarters of this year - a figure 13 % lower than last year 's .
however , the bbc 's correspondent in shanghai , francis markus , says the total may be higher since some deaths go unreported .
these often occur in illegal , unregulated mines , which have mushroomed as china 's industrial revolution drives the country 's huge demand for coal .
mines which are shut down because of poor safety records quickly reopen , our correspondent says .
the accident is now the most costly in terms of human life since 162 people died in a mine blast in guizhou in 2000 .

bbc wales ' week in week out programme has learned that figures to be published next year will show no improvement in child dental health .
every year , 10,000 welsh youngsters have rotten teeth pulled out under general anaesthetic .
the programme says many dentists and health advisers believe the answer is adding fluoride to water supplies .
caitlin goodwin , aged five , from newbridge , had to have five bad teeth taken out in hospital .
somehow we have got to get fluoride in contact with people 's teeth professor elizabeth treasure , cardiff dental school .
her elder sisters have both had similar dental problems , and underwent multiple extractions in their early years .
but mother nicola said parents face a real dilemma .
" you ca n't say no to all their sweets and things because they 're only children at the end of the day , " she said .
" you have to strike a balance . "
the state of children 's teeth is an even bigger problem in deprived areas , the programme claims .
in the area where caitlin goodwin lives , 60 % of children under five have had fillings or extractions .
in merthyr vale , 29 % of children under five has had teeth out under general anaesthetic .
the latest figures - which will be published early next year - are expected to show no change , in spite of welsh assembly government targets to improve children 's dental health .
education about dental hygiene is vital " somehow we have got to get fluoride in contact with people 's teeth , " said professor elizabeth treasure of the cardiff dental school .
" someone has to make that decision . "
some dentists blame bad parenting for the poor state of children 's teeth , including brecon dentist tony lees - an outspoken opponent of fluoridation .
" why should we all have to drink this stuff because of the sake of a few families who , because of ignorance , do n't get the right diet ? " he argued .
dr steve boyle , director of community dentistry in gwent , said : " in some of the poorer areas you will see some of the same dental disease that i 've seen for the past 20 years .
" there 's been no improvement , as far as i can see , in comparison to the uk as a whole , who have benefited enormously from big improvements in child dental health . "
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said health minister jane hutt could not give an interview to discuss the questions raised because her diary was full .
