elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .
" he was an ambassador of a movement that spoke to people who wanted change . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's first rock and pop museum opens … where ?

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .
" he was an ambassador of a movement that spoke to people who wanted change . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's first rock and pop museum opens … where ?

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign .

" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .

" we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .
" he was an ambassador of a movement that spoke to people who wanted change . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's first rock and pop museum opens … where ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : viktor vs. viktor yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 opinion : what next for ukraine 's foreign policy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich won what was called " an east-west showdown " in ukraine , pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich has emerged as the winner of a presidential election many have denounced as undemocratic .
dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

in a cable dated march 15 , 2004 , outgoing us secretary of state colin powell requested eu state department posts to act against the new eu chemical regulation scheme .
the european commission proposal would create " an expensive new regulatory system for chemicals , " powell warned .
the proposal was presented after an eight-week long public internet hearing ending in july 2003 which resulted in a total of 6,400 comments from the industry , ngos , and governments .
enterprises that manufacture or import more than one ton of a chemical substance per year would be required to register it in a central database under the new scheme .
the new regulation would reverse the burden of proof from public authorities to industry for ensuring the safety of chemicals on the market , something environmental organizations have protested against .
it would also replace over 40 existing directives and regulations .

" earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed .

" ukraine today is on the verge of civil conflict , " the pro-western former premier warned , as the lviv region , an opposition bastion , joined the capital kiev and five other cities in rejecting the official results giving victory in sunday 's presidential vote to pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich .

" earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

the 1,000-1,500 strong forces are expected to be able to be rapidly deployable - 10 days after a unanimous decision from eu member states has been taken and a battle plan created .
in a statement , the dutch eu presidency said that the creation of the groups would help the eu to " deal better with threats and global challenges . " diplomats say that the force is expected to be used under un-mandated operations , preparing the ground for large un operations that take longer to deploy . they will also be able to take on smaller missions independently .
the first groups , it is hoped , will be ready in 2005-2006 .
france , italy , spain and the uk will form their own groups , in addition to nine other " battle groups , " each consisting of troops from three or four member states .
ireland has said that it will look into the possibility of participating , but did not pledge troops on monday , while estonia has said it will take part and will continue consultations .
austria and the czech republic both pledged troops .
each group will be associated with a force headquarters and will be headed by a ‘ lead nation , ’ which will take up operational command . -lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- www-links eu observer the latest eu-related news more briefs 22.11.2004 -pipe- eu parliament demands answers on barrot 22.11.2004 -pipe- eu means changes to france ’ s constitution 22.11.2004 -pipe- new animal welfare rules 19.11.2004 -pipe- chirac calls for multi-polar world 19.11.2004 -pipe- dispute over norwegians in eu battle groups 19.11.2004 -pipe- eu to offer belarus olive branch 18.11.2004 -pipe- britain , france play down differences 18.11.2004 -pipe- spain to advise poland on spending eu money radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in a cable dated march 15 , 2004 , outgoing us secretary of state colin powell requested eu state department posts to act against the new eu chemical regulation scheme .
the european commission proposal would create " an expensive new regulatory system for chemicals , " powell warned .
the proposal was presented after an eight-week long public internet hearing ending in july 2003 which resulted in a total of 6,400 comments from the industry , ngos , and governments .
enterprises that manufacture or import more than one ton of a chemical substance per year would be required to register it in a central database under the new scheme .
the new regulation would reverse the burden of proof from public authorities to industry for ensuring the safety of chemicals on the market , something environmental organizations have protested against .
it would also replace over 40 existing directives and regulations .

the 1,000-1,500 strong forces are expected to be able to be rapidly deployable - 10 days after a unanimous decision from eu member states has been taken and a battle plan created .
in a statement , the dutch eu presidency said that the creation of the groups would help the eu to " deal better with threats and global challenges . " diplomats say that the force is expected to be used under un-mandated operations , preparing the ground for large un operations that take longer to deploy . they will also be able to take on smaller missions independently .
the first groups , it is hoped , will be ready in 2005-2006 .
france , italy , spain and the uk will form their own groups , in addition to nine other " battle groups , " each consisting of troops from three or four member states .
ireland has said that it will look into the possibility of participating , but did not pledge troops on monday , while estonia has said it will take part and will continue consultations .
austria and the czech republic both pledged troops .
each group will be associated with a force headquarters and will be headed by a ‘ lead nation , ’ which will take up operational command . -lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- www-links eu observer the latest eu-related news more briefs 22.11.2004 -pipe- eu parliament demands answers on barrot 22.11.2004 -pipe- eu means changes to france ’ s constitution 22.11.2004 -pipe- new animal welfare rules 19.11.2004 -pipe- chirac calls for multi-polar world 19.11.2004 -pipe- dispute over norwegians in eu battle groups 19.11.2004 -pipe- eu to offer belarus olive branch 18.11.2004 -pipe- britain , france play down differences 18.11.2004 -pipe- spain to advise poland on spending eu money radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .

yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .

and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : viktor vs. viktor yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 opinion : what next for ukraine 's foreign policy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich won what was called " an east-west showdown " in ukraine , pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich has emerged as the winner of a presidential election many have denounced as undemocratic .
dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .
" he was an ambassador of a movement that spoke to people who wanted change . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's first rock and pop museum opens … where ?

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "

members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

" earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities .

" earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

britain 's financial times expected the ukrainian election dispute to spread .
el pais saw an explosive situation in the former soviet republic .
while international observers reported that the apparent victory of the prime minister , and heir to corrupt leonid kutchma , did not come about in a regular manner , the paper noted .
while the eu and the usa speak of electoral fraud , russian president vladimir putin congratulated prime minister viktor yanukovich on a convincing victory .
this is the worst of almost all possible outcomes , wrote britain 's the independent .
but it was already in the cards long before the campaign began .
if yanukovich is declared president , his international credibility will be near zero and ukraine will be left out in the cold , its course inward and eastward , not outward to europe , the paper said .
the neue zürcher zeitung pondered whether ukraine will experience what happened in georgia , where angry crowds swept a president from power a year ago .
it recalled that the kuchma regime still in power has once before been shaken by huge demonstrations over the killing of a journalist .
in moscow , the business paper vedomosti pointed out that ukraine is not georgia .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .
" he was an ambassador of a movement that spoke to people who wanted change . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's first rock and pop museum opens … where ?

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .
he withdrew his candidature following objections from the assembly to his arch-conservative views on gays and women . . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : time to get to work the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .

during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .

" marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave orange ribbons and flags to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections at the ukrainian parliament in kiev in kiev 's independence square , meanwhile , opposition supporters massed in the bright orange colour of yushchenko 's campaign promised to carry on their protests until victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : viktor vs. viktor yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 opinion : what next for ukraine 's foreign policy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich won what was called " an east-west showdown " in ukraine , pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich has emerged as the winner of a presidential election many have denounced as undemocratic .
dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign .

it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .

the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period .

" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result .

gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .

" we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

this is the worst of almost all possible outcomes , wrote britain 's the independent .

if yanukovich is declared president , his international credibility will be near zero and ukraine will be left out in the cold , its course inward and eastward , not outward to europe , the paper said .
the neue zürcher zeitung pondered whether ukraine will experience what happened in georgia , where angry crowds swept a president from power a year ago .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .

yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

" earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

" deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian orthodox church priests chant anti government slogans to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on the main square of ukrainian capital kiev on tuesday in a further sign of the deep divisions wracking the country , the regional government of donetsk , a pro-moscow fiefdom , denounced the protests gripping kiev and the ukrainian-speaking western districts . the council of donetsk , from where the premier hails , called on yushchenko and his supporters " to accept defeat with dignity and to accept the complete and irrevocable victory of yanukovich . " earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave orange ribbons and flags to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections at the ukrainian parliament in kiev in kiev 's independence square , meanwhile , opposition supporters massed in the bright orange colour of yushchenko 's campaign promised to carry on their protests until victory .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .

" " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .

but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 ukraine locked in election standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors suppoort the opposition a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . as tens of thousands of opposition supporters massed in kiev , the capital 's city council refused to recognize the official results and urged parliament to follow suit .
two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : viktor vs. viktor yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 opinion : what next for ukraine 's foreign policy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich won what was called " an east-west showdown " in ukraine , pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich has emerged as the winner of a presidential election many have denounced as undemocratic .
dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .

" i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : viktor vs. viktor yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 opinion : what next for ukraine 's foreign policy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich won what was called " an east-west showdown " in ukraine , pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich has emerged as the winner of a presidential election many have denounced as undemocratic .
dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .
he withdrew his candidature following objections from the assembly to his arch-conservative views on gays and women . . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : time to get to work the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .
he withdrew his candidature following objections from the assembly to his arch-conservative views on gays and women . . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : time to get to work the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .
" he was an ambassador of a movement that spoke to people who wanted change . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's first rock and pop museum opens … where ?

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .

the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.11.2004 eu commission stumbles at first hurdle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transport commissioner jacques barrot after a difficult start , jose barroso 's new eu commission was finally given the green light to start work last week .
now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .
he withdrew his candidature following objections from the assembly to his arch-conservative views on gays and women . . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : time to get to work the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 ukraine locked in election standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors suppoort the opposition a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . as tens of thousands of opposition supporters massed in kiev , the capital 's city council refused to recognize the official results and urged parliament to follow suit .
two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .
" he inspired and motivated society , " he explained .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

" ukraine today is on the verge of civil conflict , " the pro-western former premier warned , as the lviv region , an opposition bastion , joined the capital kiev and five other cities in rejecting the official results giving victory in sunday 's presidential vote to pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich .
ukrainian parliament speaker vladimir litvin refused to recognize the oath of office , and the parliamentary session was attended by too few deputies to make any binding resolution . " there has been no inauguration , " he said .
" one must not provoke people . " deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian orthodox church priests chant anti government slogans to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on the main square of ukrainian capital kiev on tuesday in a further sign of the deep divisions wracking the country , the regional government of donetsk , a pro-moscow fiefdom , denounced the protests gripping kiev and the ukrainian-speaking western districts . the council of donetsk , from where the premier hails , called on yushchenko and his supporters " to accept defeat with dignity and to accept the complete and irrevocable victory of yanukovich . " earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave orange ribbons and flags to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections at the ukrainian parliament in kiev in kiev 's independence square , meanwhile , opposition supporters massed in the bright orange colour of yushchenko 's campaign promised to carry on their protests until victory .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .
23 , 2004 -rrb- ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . -lrb- nov .
21 , 2004 -rrb- stand-off in ukrainian election early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president . -lrb- nov .

" ukraine today is on the verge of civil conflict , " the pro-western former premier warned , as the lviv region , an opposition bastion , joined the capital kiev and five other cities in rejecting the official results giving victory in sunday 's presidential vote to pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich .
ukrainian parliament speaker vladimir litvin refused to recognize the oath of office , and the parliamentary session was attended by too few deputies to make any binding resolution . " there has been no inauguration , " he said .
" one must not provoke people . " deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian orthodox church priests chant anti government slogans to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on the main square of ukrainian capital kiev on tuesday in a further sign of the deep divisions wracking the country , the regional government of donetsk , a pro-moscow fiefdom , denounced the protests gripping kiev and the ukrainian-speaking western districts . the council of donetsk , from where the premier hails , called on yushchenko and his supporters " to accept defeat with dignity and to accept the complete and irrevocable victory of yanukovich . " earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .
he withdrew his candidature following objections from the assembly to his arch-conservative views on gays and women . . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : time to get to work the revamped european commission is neither the winner nor the loser of the battle in brussels .

" ukraine today is on the verge of civil conflict , " the pro-western former premier warned , as the lviv region , an opposition bastion , joined the capital kiev and five other cities in rejecting the official results giving victory in sunday 's presidential vote to pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich .
ukrainian parliament speaker vladimir litvin refused to recognize the oath of office , and the parliamentary session was attended by too few deputies to make any binding resolution . " there has been no inauguration , " he said .
" one must not provoke people . " deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian orthodox church priests chant anti government slogans to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on the main square of ukrainian capital kiev on tuesday in a further sign of the deep divisions wracking the country , the regional government of donetsk , a pro-moscow fiefdom , denounced the protests gripping kiev and the ukrainian-speaking western districts . the council of donetsk , from where the premier hails , called on yushchenko and his supporters " to accept defeat with dignity and to accept the complete and irrevocable victory of yanukovich . " earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities .

now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal . the sigh of relief which swept through the new commission at the end of last week when the european parliament endorsed the choice of the three final commissioners , has been turned into one of frustration . plans to get the commission 's five-year term underway have been blighted by revelations concerning the french transport commissioner , jacques barrot .
members of the european parliament revealed on monday that barrot was convicted , and later pardoned , in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . barroso , who had been hoping to kick off with issues such as eu economic reform , was left no option but to deal with the sudden controversy surrounding barrot .
he said that like everyone else , he had been kept in the dark over the frenchman 's conviction , but expressed his support for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president , jose manuel barroso " i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso said in an interview with the belgian newspaper la libre belgique .
he added that he was sure barrot would make an excellent commissioner . no cover-up on monday , barrot released a letter to the president of the european parliament , josep borrell , explaining that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , which meant there was no need to disclose it . " i had nothing to cover up and i absolutely did not look to cover up anything from the european parliament , which i profoundly respect , " barrot wrote .
the transport commissioner offered to appear before the parliament again in order to provide " any extra clarification " , but said he would pursue his eu duties " in all honesty and perfect transparency " . under the french amnesty law , the media were forbidden from reporting the conviction after chirac pardoned barrot .
it only emerged when britain 's anti-eu uk independence party aired the case in the european parliament last week . rough beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaking in brussels , german foreign minister joschka fischer warned against any further debate on commission personnel , stating that the time had come for the eu body to start concentrating on the tasks in hand . the late start came after meps rejected barroso 's italian choice for justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione .

elvis fans can be a determined bunch , and that 's why much of the memorabilia is behind glass .
" we do n't want anything ending up on ebay , " explained jürgen reiche , the director of the house of history in bonn . how pop culture changed germany when elvis aaron presley was drafted into the united states army , he might have left his fans back home so lonesome they could cry - but germany could n't wait to meet him . " for many , elvis opened a window on to the world , " explained reiche .
" his music and way of being gave them a touchstone - after all , many young germans had grown up without fathers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king was welcomed by crowds of screaming fans when he arrived in the northern port of bremerhaven to begin military service in october 1958 . the fresh-faced 23-year-old private assigned to the us third armored division was to spend the next 18 months at ray barracks in the sleepy town of friedberg . a corrupting influence under chancellor konrad adenauer , 1950s germany was a staid and conservative place . not everybody was thrilled to be playing host to elvis the pelvis .
local politicians alleged he was corrupting young people , while east germany dismissed his music and raunchy performances as anti-communist propaganda . in march 1960 , germany bid " auf wiedersehen " to the king of rock and roll , but not before he 'd ensured himself a permanent place in germany 's affections by recording a version of the famous folksong " muß i denn zum städtele hinaus . "
it may have been incomprehensible to his us fans , but his winsome rendition featured in the 1959 movie " gi blues " meant he was claimed as an honorary german . from pink cadillacs to priscilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as featuring clips from movies like " gi blues " and " jailhouse rock " , the house of history show includes 300 items from presley 's stay in friedberg , including the military-issue bag he was carrying when he arrived , the pink cadillac he drove on days off and even the partially reconstructed barracks hut where barbers gave him his regulation army haircut .
while presley clearly had an electrifying effect on post-war germany , ushering in the country 's lasting love-affair with american pop culture , the exhibition also explores the role germany played in presley 's life .
after all , it was here at that he met 14-year-old priscilla beaulieu , his future wife and mother of his only child , lisa marie .
at one point during his stay , he even moved his father vernon and his grandmother minnie mae into a house in bad nauheim , a small town near to the military camp where he was stationed .
" it was rock ' n ' roll and the px shops with american products and a whole new image for friedberg - very exciting , " said deputy mayor of friedberg , michael keller .
the extent to which elvis shook up mainstream culture can not be over-estimated , say the organizers .
" he still preoccupies us , he 's well-known across the generations , and he brought about a sexual , musical and social revolution , " pointed out jürgen reiche .
in his opinion , post-elvis germany was never the same again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : viktor vs. viktor yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 23.11.2004 opinion : what next for ukraine 's foreign policy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich won what was called " an east-west showdown " in ukraine , pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich has emerged as the winner of a presidential election many have denounced as undemocratic .
dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

two cities in the opposition-dominated west , lviv and ivano-frankivks , also refused to recognize the results , sparking fears that sunday 's election could further polarize the deeply divided country . with 99.38 percent of polling stations reporting , prime minister viktor yanukovich had secured 49.42 percent of the vote compared to 46.7 for his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko , the central electoral commission said .
yushchenko , however , has refused to concede . " we are launching an organized movement of civil resistance .
the campaign is only just beginning .
do n't leave independence square until victory , " he told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters massed in a central square in kiev .
yushchenko , who exit polls showed had comfortably led the vote , denounced a " total falsification " of the runoff results . yanukovich responded with an appearance on state television , calling on the demonstrators to go home while offering an olive branch to the opposition , saying that he would take the opposition 's views into account during his reign . " i understand and respect your choice and your right to your own political position , " yanukovich said .
" your view of ukraine 's future will definitely be taken into account by the new leadership of ukraine . " russia backs yanukovich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's prime minister viktor yanukovich russian president vladimir putin , on a state visit to brazil , meanwhile called yanukovich to congratulate him on his " decisive " victory , the kremlin said .
but western observers slammed the vote , the organization for security and cooperation in europe saying the election did not " meet a considerable number of osce commitments and council of europe and other european standards for democratic elections . " " it is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities , " said senator richard lugar , the senior us observer . us president george w. bush had warned outgoing president leonid kuchma kuchma that washington would review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote was not fair .
the election sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . united states mulls sanctions the united states said monday that ukraine 's weekend presidential run-off was marred by " very disturbing patterns of abuse " and threatened kiev with sanctions unless the deficiencies are resolved in the post-election period . " the united states is deeply concerned over the elections in ukraine , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli said .
" there are reports of widespread abuse and fraud in the second round of ukraine 's presidential elections . " we call on the ukrainian authorities to curb additional abuse and fraud , to uphold its international commitments to democracy and human rights and to act to ensure an outcome that reflects the will of the ukrainian people , " he told reporters . ereli said the charges of irregularities needed to be thoroughly investigated and cleared up before the international community so there could be confidence that the results of the elections reflect the will of the ukrainian people . he also said washington shared assessments from international observers that sunday 's poll failed to meet democratic standards and made clear that the united states was prepared to make good on longstanding threats to review relations with ukraine if the flaws were not corrected . eu also worried europe also expressed its concern , with dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , calling on ukrainian authorities to " review " the second round poll result . " we are very concerned about the news we have had about the outcome , " said bot in brussels .
" all eu member states are going to invite the ukrainian ambassadors to convey our feelings that in our view the second round -lrb- of elections -rrb- does not comply with international standards , " bot said of the eu 's new eastern neighbor . the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said " we used to have constructive ties with ukraine , not just the eu , but also nato .
but if the situation continues to develop negatively , we will have to reconsider our relationship . "
gernot erler , the parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman for germany 's social democrats , told dw-radio that it appeared there was voter participation of over 100 percent in some areas .
however , he also admitted the eu 's ability to influence events in ukraine was limited . " europe can still make extremely clear its position on the election and the counting of votes , " erler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko waves a banner at a massive gathering in downtown kiev .
the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

" ukraine today is on the verge of civil conflict , " the pro-western former premier warned , as the lviv region , an opposition bastion , joined the capital kiev and five other cities in rejecting the official results giving victory in sunday 's presidential vote to pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich .
ukrainian parliament speaker vladimir litvin refused to recognize the oath of office , and the parliamentary session was attended by too few deputies to make any binding resolution . " there has been no inauguration , " he said .
" one must not provoke people . " deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian orthodox church priests chant anti government slogans to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections on the main square of ukrainian capital kiev on tuesday in a further sign of the deep divisions wracking the country , the regional government of donetsk , a pro-moscow fiefdom , denounced the protests gripping kiev and the ukrainian-speaking western districts . the council of donetsk , from where the premier hails , called on yushchenko and his supporters " to accept defeat with dignity and to accept the complete and irrevocable victory of yanukovich . " earlier , yushchenko called on the international community to recognize him as the real winner of an election seen by some observers as the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . a victory for him would pull the strategically important eastern european nation of 48 million people out of russia 's age-old embrace and eventually put it into the fold of the european union and maybe even nato , shifting liberal europe 's center of gravity closer to russia 's borders . he called on " parliaments and people of the world " to recognize him as the real winner of the vote , which western governments and observers decried as massively flawed . " in the 20th century , we are facing a threat to the will of a people of one of europe 's largest countries , " he said in a statement . the dispute has split this former soviet republic down the middle , with the ukrainian-speaking west mainly behind yushchenko and the russian-speaking east backing yanukovich . dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency , told ukraine 's outgoing president leonid kuchma that the eu had " doubts " about the result of the vote . kuchma 's office retorted that " the authorities of ukraine can not intervene in the electoral process , and can not influence the election results . " british foreign secretary jack straw said it was " very difficult to argue that this was a free and fair election . " marek siwiec , leader of a group of european parliament observers , said the official result owed more to stalinist sharp practices - " a little bit of the north korean example " - than international standards of democracy . ukraine now threatens to add to the strains already evident between russia and the eu heading into a bilateral summit thursday in the hague between putin and balkenende , the eu 's current chairman . putin slams eu doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin speaking from lisbon tuesday , putin slammed as " inadmissible " the doubts expressed by the eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe over the election outcome . the central electoral commission has until december 6 to announce the final vote count and declare an official winner . official ballot counts so far show 54-year-old yanukovich won 49.39 percent of the vote compared with 50-year-old yushchenko 's 46.71 percent , with 99.48 percent of polling stations reporting . however , the opposition claim voting was rigged and has demanded a recount in several yanukovich stronghold regions where it claimed widespread fraud . international observer teams have supported allegations of malpractice and fraud , the organisation for security and cooperation in europe saying the vote did not meet democratic standards . the senior us observer , influential senator richard lugar , commented that : " it is now apparent a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities .

the opposition , buoyed by exit polls released late sunday night , quickly went on the offensive against any voting fraud by mobilizing a wave of popular protest .
it urged thousands of its supporters to keep up a vigil in kiev 's main square , where tens of thousands of people - nearly all sporting the opposition 's orange color - had converged by monday night . the central square was jam-packed with people in the chilly temperatures as the crowds danced around to rock-performing bands .
the disputed results heightened fears of a violent standoff between the opposition and the government of this strategic ex-soviet state . the vote was seen as one of the most important in eastern europe since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union and will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

dw 's ute schaeffer looks at repercussions for the nation 's foreign policy . the western media billed sunday 's election as a vote for either russia or europe - a choice between a return to the soviet past or integration with europe .
pro-western liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko was set to tilt the nation further to the west , while prime minister viktor yanukovich hails from the traditional , russian-speaking east of the country .
his foreign policy is therefore expected to build on strengthening ties with moscow , with relations to europe a secondary concern . blurred lines but the issue is n't quite so black and white .
during his term as prime minister between 1999 and 2001 , yushchenko also cultivated close economic ties with russia .
he was brought down in a no-confidence vote in 2001 , organized by the oligarch-led parties and the communist party , primarily because of his anti-corruption agenda - and not because his policies were at odds with russian interests , as many speculated at the time . meanwhile , yanukovich has also been criticized - not least by moscow - for a restrictive economic policy in his home region of donezk , eastern ukraine , because russian businesses have been unable to buy their way in . nonetheless , its was apparent during the election campaign that yanukovich had the kremlin 's backing .
russian president vladimir putin paid two visits to kiev , praising yanukovich 's economic policy and making a great public show of his support . ukraine and russia in return , however , moscow will now expect the new ukrainian president to protect russian business interests in the country , which include first and foremost energy concerns . some 90 percent of the russian gazprom corporation 's exports are transported to western europe via ukrainian pipelines - revenue crucial to the survival of the russian economy .
tax revenue from gazprom makes up one third of russia 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the country 's economic growth hangs by the fragile thread of its increasing energy exports .
an independent-minded ukrainian president could cut that thread all-too-easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome of the recent election is therefore of key importance to moscow .
the appointment of yanukovich would guarantee further development of the single economic space -lrb- eep -rrb- signed a year ago .
the agreement was reached by outgoing president leonid kutschma -lrb- pictured , with putin -rrb- and his counterparts in russia , belarus and kazakhstan , with the aim of creating a customs union and integrated economic zone . ukraine and europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko addresses his supporters in front of an election poster showing him and his youngest son taras , in kiev , early monday , nov .
1 , 2004 .
yanukovych led the high-tension presidential race in this post-soviet republic with about 48 percent of the vote , not enough for a first-round victory , the central elections commission said early on monday . -lrb- ap photo / ivan sekretarev -rrb- but the presidential race is , above all , a test of the political climate in ukraine . prime minister yanokovich and president kutschma have kept a tight rein on the national media , while rival presidential candidate yushchenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- pledged to uphold freedom of the press .
and while political pressure within state structures and among civil servants became increasingly oppressive in the run-up to the election , yushchenko successfully managed to unite the heterogenous opposition . as prime minister , he went some way to establishing a socially-oriented market economy , while yanokovich 's social agenda included little more than last-minute promises of increases to pensions and public sector wages . ukraine is a classic transit nation , sharing borders with seven countries .
for this reason , any ukrainian government will have to develop policies geared to both west and east .
the vote showed how divided the country is .
part of the electorate - the majority , according to official figures - voted for strong-arm tactics based on soviet models .
but at the same time , interest in fundamentally restructuring ukrainian politics and economics is clearly gaining ground - as yushchenko 's popularity showed . the presidential election was a battle over whether to face east or west .
soon , europe will have to decide what sort of a ukraine it wants to cooperate with and support . with yanukovich in office , this cooperation wo n't be easy . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged . -lrb- nov .

birmingham airport said negotiations with the union were continuing .
the ballot of amicus members will begin on tuesday .

he had been diagnosed with the disease shortly after taking over from jim cantalupo , who died suddenly of a heart attack in april .
jim skinner , a veteran of 33 years at the company , will assume the top job .
mcdonald 's has ridden out a rough patch in recent years , switching to healthier options and seeing profits surge .
among the firm 's innovations are a greater range of salads and fruit , and in some cases smaller portions .
the three months to september had seen a 42 % rise in earnings .
smooth takeover mr bell 's need for therapy for colorectal cancer has disrupted his work , including a gathering of managers from around the world which took place in australia earlier this month .
he will remain chairman of the board , the company said .
the shake-up at the top was unlikely to change the company 's path , analysts said , since all those concerned were long-term insiders .
mr bell , now 44 , started work in a mcdonald 's outlet in his native sydney when he was 15 .
by 19 , he was the youngest store manager in the country , and has been with the group ever since .
the new chief executive , jim skinner , started at the group in 1971 as a trainee manager , and has since served in positions with oversight of almost every market in which the firm operates .
most recently he took responsibility for mcdonald 's japan , the group 's second-biggest market after the us with nearly 4,000 outlets .

the council for national parks -lrb- cnp -rrb- is challenging a decision to grant planning permission for bluestone .
part of the development falls within pembrokeshire coast national park authority land but members backed it against the advice of their officers .
the hearing in swansea is scheduled for three days but the judge may not issue a decision for several weeks . "
we will be urging the judge to uphold our concerns and quash this planning permission " ruth chambers , cnp the court is expected to hear legal submissions from the cnp , the park authority , and developers .
the cnp , which acts as a watchdog for the uk 's national parks , claims authority members went against their own national and local policies in granting permission for the scheme near narberth that includes 340 timber lodges .
head of policy ruth chambers said : " we have taken the unprecedented step of going to court because of the scale of the bluestone development .
" it is completely inappropriate in a national park .
we will be urging the judge to uphold our concerns and quash this planning permission for what would in effect be a new town in beautiful , unspoilt countryside . "
the developers of bluestone say the project will create 600 full and part-time jobs with a further 200 jobs for contractors and suppliers .
they and the pembrokeshire coast national park authority will tell the hearing that the plans were given unanimous backing by members after several hearings and prolonged talks .
they will also claim bluestone is not a planning or environmental precedent as two other major uk holiday villages are built in areas of outstanding natural beauty .
the court will also hear that a landscape and planting programme will ensure the holiday site will not be visible from any existing settlement or private house , and will help improve habitats for wildlife and increase biodiversity .
