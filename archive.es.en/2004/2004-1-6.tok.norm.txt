the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .

" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .

meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .

in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .

two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .

-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .

german carmakers registered highs and lows amidst the sleek chrome and lights at the detroit auto show : while porsche made tidy profits in the u.s. last year , volkswagen had a rough ride . many german luxury carmakers were in a buoyant mood at the north america international auto show in detroit , which opened its doors on sunday .
the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .
volkswagen records losses in the u.s. in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood among most german carmakers , volkswagen however had bad news to deliver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen concept r is shown at the north american international auto show .
hans dieter pötsch , finance chief of europe ’ s largest carmaker , said volkwagen will lose money in its u.s. business after profit dipped in 2003 .
" in the auto business -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- alone , that is excluding financial services , we will be slightly negative in 2003 , " hans-dieter pötsch told reporters , adding he predicted a similar result for this year .
volkswagen has suffered from an overall decline in demand , the resurgent strength of the euro against the dollar and the cutting of jobs in brazil last year .
vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder however said he expected the depressed german car market to look up in 2004 .
" i am optimistic that after so many years of decline in europe , a positive development in germany at least will set in 2004 , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars disappoint car owners mercedes and bmw for all their glamour , are n't the preferred choice of german car-owners , according to two surprising new surveys released this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.01.2004 opinion : will beards be banned soon too ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it sounds absurd that german officials want to liberate muslim women with a law on headscarves .
the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .

german carmakers registered highs and lows amidst the sleek chrome and lights at the detroit auto show : while porsche made tidy profits in the u.s. last year , volkswagen had a rough ride . many german luxury carmakers were in a buoyant mood at the north america international auto show in detroit , which opened its doors on sunday .
the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .
volkswagen records losses in the u.s. in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood among most german carmakers , volkswagen however had bad news to deliver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen concept r is shown at the north american international auto show .
hans dieter pötsch , finance chief of europe ’ s largest carmaker , said volkwagen will lose money in its u.s. business after profit dipped in 2003 .
" in the auto business -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- alone , that is excluding financial services , we will be slightly negative in 2003 , " hans-dieter pötsch told reporters , adding he predicted a similar result for this year .
volkswagen has suffered from an overall decline in demand , the resurgent strength of the euro against the dollar and the cutting of jobs in brazil last year .
vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder however said he expected the depressed german car market to look up in 2004 .
" i am optimistic that after so many years of decline in europe , a positive development in germany at least will set in 2004 , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars disappoint car owners mercedes and bmw for all their glamour , are n't the preferred choice of german car-owners , according to two surprising new surveys released this week .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .

but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .

according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.01.2004 when turkish men love men großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most turkish men celebrate soccer , not gay pride .
homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .

there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .

the point is really to make contacts .

aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .

aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .
“ i believe that ’ s the reason they hide .
we can ’ t reach lesbians .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .
and not , it seems , the real truth about what happened that night - at least if you believe the conspiracy theorists . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the royal family : past , present - future ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2004 german automakers largely on a roll in the u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a splash in detroit - the new audi a8 luxury saloon .
german carmakers registered highs and lows amidst the sleek chrome and lights at the detroit auto show : while porsche made tidy profits in the u.s. last year , volkswagen had a rough ride . many german luxury carmakers were in a buoyant mood at the north america international auto show in detroit , which opened its doors on sunday .
the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .
volkswagen records losses in the u.s. in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood among most german carmakers , volkswagen however had bad news to deliver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen concept r is shown at the north american international auto show .
hans dieter pötsch , finance chief of europe ’ s largest carmaker , said volkwagen will lose money in its u.s. business after profit dipped in 2003 .
" in the auto business -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- alone , that is excluding financial services , we will be slightly negative in 2003 , " hans-dieter pötsch told reporters , adding he predicted a similar result for this year .
volkswagen has suffered from an overall decline in demand , the resurgent strength of the euro against the dollar and the cutting of jobs in brazil last year .
vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder however said he expected the depressed german car market to look up in 2004 .
" i am optimistic that after so many years of decline in europe , a positive development in germany at least will set in 2004 , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars disappoint car owners mercedes and bmw for all their glamour , are n't the preferred choice of german car-owners , according to two surprising new surveys released this week .

the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .

bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .

peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .
volkswagen records losses in the u.s. in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood among most german carmakers , volkswagen however had bad news to deliver .

hans dieter pötsch , finance chief of europe ’ s largest carmaker , said volkwagen will lose money in its u.s. business after profit dipped in 2003 .
" in the auto business -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- alone , that is excluding financial services , we will be slightly negative in 2003 , " hans-dieter pötsch told reporters , adding he predicted a similar result for this year .
volkswagen has suffered from an overall decline in demand , the resurgent strength of the euro against the dollar and the cutting of jobs in brazil last year .
vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder however said he expected the depressed german car market to look up in 2004 .
" i am optimistic that after so many years of decline in europe , a positive development in germany at least will set in 2004 , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars disappoint car owners mercedes and bmw for all their glamour , are n't the preferred choice of german car-owners , according to two surprising new surveys released this week .

two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .

-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .

shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .
“ i believe that ’ s the reason they hide .
we can ’ t reach lesbians .
i think this is because we live in a man ’ s world . ” cem rifat sey -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers gay victims of nazis in a decision that ’ s been called “ long overdue , ” the german parliament has approved plans to build a memorial for thousands of homosexual men persecuted or killed by the nazis .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth . chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats is also pushing for a femake president .
should the cdu pick a suitable woman , his party might not even nominate their own candidate , he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . neo-liberals as president-makers but the christian democrats have no reason to take schröder up on his offer .
together with the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , they control the majority of votes in the federal assembly - the body that elects the president and is comprised of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 states . fdp leaders have said they might still nominate their own candidate .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 06.01.2004 choosing germany 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will a man or a woman move into berlin 's bellevue palace ?
germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 06.01.2004 choosing germany 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will a man or a woman move into berlin 's bellevue palace ?
germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth . chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats is also pushing for a femake president .
should the cdu pick a suitable woman , his party might not even nominate their own candidate , he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . neo-liberals as president-makers but the christian democrats have no reason to take schröder up on his offer .
together with the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , they control the majority of votes in the federal assembly - the body that elects the president and is comprised of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 states . fdp leaders have said they might still nominate their own candidate .
but as likely coalition partners in any future cdu-led government , they are expected to support the christian democrat 's choice . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elections galore in 2004 germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .

two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .
and not , it seems , the real truth about what happened that night - at least if you believe the conspiracy theorists . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the royal family : past , present - future ?

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2004 german automakers largely on a roll in the u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a splash in detroit - the new audi a8 luxury saloon .
german carmakers registered highs and lows amidst the sleek chrome and lights at the detroit auto show : while porsche made tidy profits in the u.s. last year , volkswagen had a rough ride . many german luxury carmakers were in a buoyant mood at the north america international auto show in detroit , which opened its doors on sunday .
the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth . chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats is also pushing for a femake president .
should the cdu pick a suitable woman , his party might not even nominate their own candidate , he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . neo-liberals as president-makers but the christian democrats have no reason to take schröder up on his offer .
together with the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , they control the majority of votes in the federal assembly - the body that elects the president and is comprised of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 states . fdp leaders have said they might still nominate their own candidate .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .

an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .
“ i believe that ’ s the reason they hide .
we can ’ t reach lesbians .
i think this is because we live in a man ’ s world . ” cem rifat sey -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers gay victims of nazis in a decision that ’ s been called “ long overdue , ” the german parliament has approved plans to build a memorial for thousands of homosexual men persecuted or killed by the nazis .

after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 06.01.2004 choosing germany 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will a man or a woman move into berlin 's bellevue palace ?
germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth . chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats is also pushing for a femake president .
should the cdu pick a suitable woman , his party might not even nominate their own candidate , he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . neo-liberals as president-makers but the christian democrats have no reason to take schröder up on his offer .
together with the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , they control the majority of votes in the federal assembly - the body that elects the president and is comprised of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 states . fdp leaders have said they might still nominate their own candidate .
but as likely coalition partners in any future cdu-led government , they are expected to support the christian democrat 's choice . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elections galore in 2004 germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .

she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .

they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .
“ i believe that ’ s the reason they hide .
we can ’ t reach lesbians .

german carmakers registered highs and lows amidst the sleek chrome and lights at the detroit auto show : while porsche made tidy profits in the u.s. last year , volkswagen had a rough ride . many german luxury carmakers were in a buoyant mood at the north america international auto show in detroit , which opened its doors on sunday .
the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .
volkswagen records losses in the u.s. in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood among most german carmakers , volkswagen however had bad news to deliver .

" in the auto business -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- alone , that is excluding financial services , we will be slightly negative in 2003 , " hans-dieter pötsch told reporters , adding he predicted a similar result for this year .
volkswagen has suffered from an overall decline in demand , the resurgent strength of the euro against the dollar and the cutting of jobs in brazil last year .
vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder however said he expected the depressed german car market to look up in 2004 .

the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .

ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .

meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc bayer wins battle with european commission the eu ’ s highest court handed the german drug manufacturer bayer a legal victory on tuesday .
the luxembourg-based european court of justice ruled that the drug company would not have to pay the $ 3.8 million -lrb- € 3 million -rrb- in fines imposed on it by the european commission in 1996 .
the commission accused bayer of breaking anti-cartel laws when it sought to restrict distribution of its adalat heart drug .
bayer and other pharmaceutical companies have been battling so-called “ parallel trade ” , when distributors buy name-brand drugs in southern europe , where government-set prices are low , and resell them in the north at a higher price .
the commission felt efforts by bayer to restrict the supply of the drug to southern countries in an effort to stop the practice violated laws governing the free movement of goods .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .

two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .

-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.01.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc prodi suspends anti-semitism seminar commission president romano prodi has suspended the preparations for a seminar on anti-semitism scheduled for next month after two of the most important jewish organizations accused the european commission of bias against jews .
in a letter sent on monday to the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , and the president of the european jewish congress , cobi benatoff , prodi said he was " surprised and shocked " by their comments which appeared in a financial times editorial .
the writers took the brussels executive to task for releasing a poll in november in which israel was named the greatest threat to world peace .
they also condemned the censorship of a study which concluded that muslims and pro-palestinian groups were behind many reported incidents of anti-semitism .
prodi , however , said that the center behind the report was independent , and that the commission was not responsible for the decision not to publish the report .

in a letter sent on monday to the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , and the president of the european jewish congress , cobi benatoff , prodi said he was " surprised and shocked " by their comments which appeared in a financial times editorial .
the writers took the brussels executive to task for releasing a poll in november in which israel was named the greatest threat to world peace .
they also condemned the censorship of a study which concluded that muslims and pro-palestinian groups were behind many reported incidents of anti-semitism .
prodi , however , said that the center behind the report was independent , and that the commission was not responsible for the decision not to publish the report .
the meeting on anti-semitism in europe was agreed to by prodi and the world jewish congress after the furore caused by the publication of the poll last november .
" the attitude you have shown goes against our best and mutual interest , " prodi said in his letter , adding that it forced him to suspend the preparations for the seminar .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .

an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth . chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats is also pushing for a femake president .
should the cdu pick a suitable woman , his party might not even nominate their own candidate , he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . neo-liberals as president-makers but the christian democrats have no reason to take schröder up on his offer .
together with the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , they control the majority of votes in the federal assembly - the body that elects the president and is comprised of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 states . fdp leaders have said they might still nominate their own candidate .

after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .

the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .

aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .

two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .

-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .

about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .

the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .

but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .

horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president top female academic aims for presidency germany -pipe- 06.01.2004 choosing germany 's next president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will a man or a woman move into berlin 's bellevue palace ?
germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .
he added that rita süssmuth -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , an education studies professor and former president of parliament , was another candidate worth considering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth . chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats is also pushing for a femake president .
should the cdu pick a suitable woman , his party might not even nominate their own candidate , he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . neo-liberals as president-makers but the christian democrats have no reason to take schröder up on his offer .
together with the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , they control the majority of votes in the federal assembly - the body that elects the president and is comprised of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 states . fdp leaders have said they might still nominate their own candidate .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .
and not , it seems , the real truth about what happened that night - at least if you believe the conspiracy theorists . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the royal family : past , present - future ?

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .

was it the paparazzi ?
prince philip ?
osama bin laden ?
two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .
people are still placing flowers at the gates of kensington palace in memory of diana , princess of wales , who was buried saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?
that 's remained a secret . was she pregnant ? who could have ordered diana 's death ? some say it was osama bin laden .
or maybe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's husband . because as some sources have claimed recently , including the independent on sunday newspaper , diana was pregnant at the time of her death , and was planning to marry dodi . the palace was apparently up in arms at the thought that the heir to the british throne , prince william , might have a muslim half-brother and father-in-law . and bin laden ? he was apparently outraged at diana 's role as a confident , modern woman pursuing her own happiness .
she was giving women in islamic countries reason to rebel . but osama has disappeared , as has the white fiat uno or citroen ax that is thought to have rammed into the mercedes carrying dodi and the princess . traces of paint have been found , but not the car .
and not , it seems , the real truth about what happened that night - at least if you believe the conspiracy theorists . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the royal family : past , present - future ?

two british inquests are supposed to find out who caused the death of diana , princess of wales , and dodi al fayed .
conspiracy theorists have their own ideas . more than six years after the couple died in a paris car crash , separate inquests into the deaths of princess diana and dodi al fayed begin on tuesday .
they are likely to be the only official british investigations into the 1997 crash in the pont de l 'alma underpass in paris . the inquests are both being overseen by michael burgess , who in addition to being royal coroner , is also the coroner of surrey , where dodi al fayed is buried . he immediately adjourned the hearings pending his examination of the 6,000-page file that french authorities compiled on the crash .
it could be over a year before hearings get underway . but the idea that diana , the most photographed woman in the world , and self-proclaimed " queen of hearts , " died at age 36 in a car accident just seems too ordinary to be believed for many of her devoted fans . accident or plot ? conspiracy theorists point out how little is known about the incidents surrounding her death . on the night of aug .
31 , 1997 , diana and boyfriend dodi , son of harrods owner mohammed al fayed , ducked out a rear entrance to paris ' hotel ritz and climbed into an armoured mercedes in a bid to flee paparazzi camped outside the hotel 's entrance . hotel security guard henri paul was in the driver 's seat .
he drove fast - too fast , as it turned out - and was pursued by photographers in cars and on motorcycles . in the tunnel of the pont de l 'alma , the mercedes rammed into the 13th pillar supporting the tunnel roof with a speed of over 100 km . only diana 's bodyguard , trevor rees-jones survived , but ca n't remember the events of that night . diana died in paris ' pitie salpetriere hospital ; the others in the car died instantly . the french inquiry concluded that the crash happened because the couple 's chauffeur was speeding and had been drinking heavily in addition to taking anti-depressants .
dodi 's father refused to accept the findings and soon became the most vocal of the conspiracy theorists . he filed court appeals against the french findings , helping to delay the start of the british inquests , which could only start once proceedings in france were closed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a poster of diana , princess of wales outside kensington palace in london monday september 8 , 1997 .

-lrb- ap photo / adrian dennis -rrb- -lrb- photo für kalenderblatt -rrb- rumors wo n't go away rumors that diana was the victim of a murderous plot began circulating soon after her death . they gained new life in october last year , when her former butler , paul burrell , released a letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she named a person who was " planning an accident " with her car to clear the way for prince charles to marry his longtime lover , camilla parker-bowles . there have also been speculations about the role of the chauffeur , henri paul .
his parents maintain that someone switched his blood sample , which revealed a high alcohol level and traces of drugs , to incriminate him . videos from the ritz hotel show that paul was capable of tying his shoes properly before getting into the car .
and why was he even driving in the first place ?
he was a security guard after all , not a chauffeur trained to deal with the exceptionally heavy mercedes . the questions seemed to pile up .
according to u.s. broadcaster cnn , a chauffeur named olivier lafaye , who regularly drove the doomed mercedes , said the car was having problems with its brakes . and then there 's the point about the seat belts . officially , the word was the diana and dodi were n't wearing theirs , but journalist nicholas davies says he found different information . they were wearing them , but someone had tampered with the bolts . rumors spread that the french and british secret services were somehow involved , maybe even the cia . but why ?

homosexuality is taboo in turkey .
but in germany , turkish gays have more freedom .
language , however , sometimes creates problems . metin was married in turkey .
after nearly eight years , he got divorced because his wife didn ’ t understand him .
being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .
“ i believe that ’ s the reason they hide .
we can ’ t reach lesbians .
i think this is because we live in a man ’ s world . ” cem rifat sey -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers gay victims of nazis in a decision that ’ s been called “ long overdue , ” the german parliament has approved plans to build a memorial for thousands of homosexual men persecuted or killed by the nazis .

they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .

aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .

being gay played no role in the decision , he said .
he didn ’ t realize that he loved men until he came to germany .
now metin is one of approximately 15,000 homosexuals with turkish roots living in the country .
for this group of people , coming out is the biggest problem , metin said : “ i am active , but i don ’ t identify myself publicly as a gay man .
for familial reasons , because in the turkish community , gays are not held in high regard .
for me it ’ s no problem , but my family would be sad . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainbow flag , a symbol of gay pride , flies in front of berlin city hall for the annual gay pride parade .
metin believes that german gays have it better because their families understand homosexuality as normal .
he likes living in germany .
there are many more chances for gays , he believes .
in turkey , he would only be allowed to do a small portion of the things he can do in germany . a game of hide-and-seek in part , though , it remains a game of hide-and-seek .
turkish gays often prefer to stay in the immigrant scene and the majority of immigrants in germany don ’ t come from the big turkish cities , where there is more tolerance for people who live alternative lives .
they mostly come from rural areas of anatolia , where homosexuality is at best seen as a sickness . even though tolerance toward homosexuals has increased in the past years , people behave cautiously .
it ’ s not difficult , however , for gay men with turkish roots to meet people , said metin .
there are web sites , parties and classified ads , for instance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet helps turkish gay living in germany to connect .
lola is the founder of one of these web sites : “ delidivane ” has become an important virtual meeting spot for turkish gays to meet not only germans , but also other immigrants .
delidivane is “ very international , ” said lola .
she is heterosexual , but said she has a good understanding of gays . a way to reach out to others in contrast to most gay web sites , hers doesn ’ t promote sexual encounters , lola said .
the point is really to make contacts .
“ we have no pornographic pictures , ” she said .
“ i don ’ t want to have them at all .
and our members don ’ t want them either .
they always say , delidivane has to stay clean . ” even if meeting people isn ’ t a problem , there are other things that are of concern to turkish-german gays .
aids is a special issue because many gay turkish immigrants are not well informed and therefore the infection rate is higher , said gökay , who works at an aids project called “ maasallah ” in essen . a big part of the challenge is that much of the information material is only printed in german .
“ even married men may prefer sex with other men , ” gökay said .
“ because they do this without knowing about the aids risk , the risk of infection is relatively high . ” maasallah is also concerned about lesbians , gökay added .
but turkish women who love women seldom identify themselves publicly , and thus are hard to locate .
“ many lesbian women are married , ” he said .
“ i believe that ’ s the reason they hide .
we can ’ t reach lesbians .
i think this is because we live in a man ’ s world . ” cem rifat sey -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers gay victims of nazis in a decision that ’ s been called “ long overdue , ” the german parliament has approved plans to build a memorial for thousands of homosexual men persecuted or killed by the nazis .

germany elects a new head of state in may .
political leaders are beginning to express preferences , knowing that their choice could have an effect on who becomes chancellor in 2006 . for some , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel might be the perfect person to succeed federal president johannes rau , who at age 72 declined to run for reelection last september .
merkel ’ s party is also likely to choose germany ’ s next figurehead as it has the most votes in the federal assembly that elects the president . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a full time job of accepting flower bouquets does n't seem to fit angela merkel 's future career plans .
but the former eastern german doesn ’ t seem interested in becoming the next tenant at berlin ’ s presidential palace , since doing so would require that she give up her membership in the country 's leading opposition party . instead , she ’ s eyeing the possibility of becoming a candidate for chancellor during the general elections planned for 2006 .
that ’ s also the reason merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- has apparently been hesitant in suggesting another woman for the highest office in the land . two women at the top too much for germans ? remembering the dangers of a powerful president , which played a crucial role in adolf hitler ’ s rise to power , the founding fathers of post-war germany limited the position of federal president to largely ceremonial duties such as state visits and signing laws .
germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
but stoiber , who beat merkel as candidate for chancellor in the 2002 elections and might want to do the same again in 2006 , has made it clear that he ’ d rather stay on as premier of his state for the time being . the csu seems ready to nominate another candidate for the job : wolfgang schäuble , a former government minister and cdu leader , who now serves as his party ’ s spokesman for foreign , security and european policy in parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un under-secretary-general klaus töpfer is a possible candidate for federal president .
according to a report in the mass circulation german daily bild , merkel could also nominate a fellow former minister of environmental issues : klaus töpfer -lrb- cdu , photo -rrb- , who now serves as head of the united nations environment program .
an announcement could come as early as next week , according to the paper . chancellor wants a mrs. president töpfer is a candidate some greens might support as president as well , party leader reinhard bütikofer recently said .

germans seem ready to accept a first female president , but there ’ s some doubt as to whether they would also elect a woman to head the government two years later . like most politicians , merkel has held back on naming a personal favorite , saying that a hasty decision would not dignify the importance of the office .
but she seems to want a man for the job .
her dream candidate is likely to be edmund stoiber , the leader of the cdu ’ s bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .

german carmakers registered highs and lows amidst the sleek chrome and lights at the detroit auto show : while porsche made tidy profits in the u.s. last year , volkswagen had a rough ride . many german luxury carmakers were in a buoyant mood at the north america international auto show in detroit , which opened its doors on sunday .
the premier event of its kind , the detroit car show may be all about unveiling and flaunting the latest in chrome and gleaming metal on four wheels , but there ’ s no denying that it ’ s also the definitive event for the auto industry ’ s top brass to take stock of business in one of their most crucial markets .
porsche comes out tops business hasn ’ t been bad at all for german car companies in 2003 , who export over 20 percent of their cars to the united states .
the clear winner has been sport car maker porsche .
peter schwarzenbauer , head of the company 's north american business operations , told reporters that its cayenne sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- had helped increase sales in the region by a third last calendar year , boosting its turnover in 2003 by 33 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche carrera gt , foreground , and the cayenne sports-utility vehicle .
" i believe that with the cayenne we have the possibility to significantly widen our market , " schwarzenbauer said , adding that the suv could help shore up market share in states other than southern california , florida and the east coast , the traditional markets for luxury cars .
" we will sell around 35,000 cars -lrb- in north america -rrb- by the end of the business year , " schwarzenbauer said .
porsche , which posted its ninth straight record year of profit last year , aims to sell 70,000 vehicles globally this business year .
porsche executive hans riedel told reuters news agency that on average , the u.s. accounts for around 50 percent of porsche ’ s sales .
audi and bmw on course while it may not have been such a heady year for audi , the german carmaker nevertheless registered a stable upward trend .
the volkswagen subsidiary , which used the detroit show to roll out its new signature 12-cylinder a8 luxury saloon on sunday , said it sold 87,000 core audi brand cars in the u.s. last year .
ralf weiler , audi 's vice president for sales , said the u.s. remained the second-most important market for the company , after china .
" we had a better sales result in 2003 than in the year before by 1 percent and so we can be satisfied with the result . "
meanwhile audi ’ s worldwide sales reached 767,000 vehicles in 2003 , an increase of 3.4 percent from a year earlier .
bmw north america chief tom perves admitted that the past year had been a tough one for the munich-based luxury carmaker , but said the company had sold over 1.1 million cars last year , a 4.3 percent rise from 2002 .
in the u.s. , the carmaker also sold 8 percent more vehicles in 2003 despite a five percent fall in december .
bmw saw its profits fall sharply in the first half of 2003 as development costs for a raft of new models shot up , but earnings rose again in the third quarter , boosted by strong demand for its new 5-series model .
perves pointed to the huge success of its family-friendly minivan series in the u.s. and said the company had profited hugely with the introduction of new models .
volkswagen records losses in the u.s. in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood among most german carmakers , volkswagen however had bad news to deliver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen concept r is shown at the north american international auto show .
hans dieter pötsch , finance chief of europe ’ s largest carmaker , said volkwagen will lose money in its u.s. business after profit dipped in 2003 .
" in the auto business -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- alone , that is excluding financial services , we will be slightly negative in 2003 , " hans-dieter pötsch told reporters , adding he predicted a similar result for this year .
volkswagen has suffered from an overall decline in demand , the resurgent strength of the euro against the dollar and the cutting of jobs in brazil last year .
vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder however said he expected the depressed german car market to look up in 2004 .
" i am optimistic that after so many years of decline in europe , a positive development in germany at least will set in 2004 , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars disappoint car owners mercedes and bmw for all their glamour , are n't the preferred choice of german car-owners , according to two surprising new surveys released this week .

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .

but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger . president johannes rau is certainly not someone who keeps his distance from the church .
the son of a preacher , who has also appeared as a lay preacher himself , has shown repeatedly during his 40-year political career how important equality , tolerance and dialogue between different religions and cultures are to him .
shortly before the end of his five-year presidential term that tolerance has placed him in the crossfire of criticism because during an interview about the headscarf debate , which for a fairly long time has been provoking some people , rau reflected : if one bans the headscarf from schools for being a religious symbol , then one could hardly defend the monk ’ s habit .
constitution requires equality the german constitution requires equal treatment of religions in the public sphere , which includes schools .
the country ’ s christian heritage won ’ t be called into question because of this , nor does germany ’ s future as a christian country depend on how many people wear which clothing to school .
“ that depends only on how many convinced and believing christians there are in our country , ” the president said .
nonetheless , politicians in seven of the 16 federal states have decided to create a legal basis for banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves .
they believe that the headscarf expresses an aggressive political or missionary stance that has no place in a neutral state facility .
this campaign was pushed by a september judgement by the federal constitutional court , in which the ban on teachers wearing headscarves was determined to be illegal as long as there weren ’ t any laws on the subject .
legal challenge set off debate the question only became an “ affair ” because a feisty young teacher with afghan roots wasn ’ t accepted as a civil servant in the state of baden-württemberg due to her headscarf – and she fought back through the legal system .
although in other states more than a dozen women who wear headscarves teach without problems or objections , this case brought the question to the political stage .
and thus the question landed in a place where it perhaps least belongs : neither bureaucrats nor politicians should decide which meaning , one or the other , a religious symbol has .
and the balance shouldn ’ t tip based on what is on rather than in the head .
and by no means should symbols of one religion be banned , while those of others are further protected , cared for or determined to be harmless .
so those who support the ban on headscarves argue , by enlisting the koran among other things , that this piece of fabric is not a religious symbol at all , but rather it stands for the suppression of women .
the monk ’ s habit or the crucifix , however , are seen as an expression of the “ nearly 2,000-year christian culture of the occident . ”
individual freedom at risk only with real effort has the discussion avoided the use of the vexing expression , the christian “ dominant culture , ” which recently created waves but then was banned as an instrument of discrimination and suppression .
but it is this stance that consciously or unconsciously informs some critics .
and that which actually should be protected ends up falling victim : the freedom of the individual .
whether the person is christian , muslim or neither .
about 3 million muslims live in germany .
but teachers wearing headscarves will not make this country into a taliban state .
and it sounds absurd that german officials or politicians want to fight for the liberation of muslim women with the help of a law on headscarves .
at least germany is not going as far as france , where the state regulations are not restricted to the representatives of the state – teachers – but apply to the population at large : paris wants to ban students from school if they are wearing a headscarf , a kippa or a cross .
in germany , that remains a private issue .
here , the wearing of headscarves would only be banned for civil servants , in this case , teachers .
but the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .
according to the same logic , male muslim teachers with a beard would have to shave before going to work , while bushy protestant beards would still be tolerated .
that can not be .
the state should remove itself from this discussion and as in other cases , only step in when freedom is abused .
and the state should not let excessive zeal allow it to forget its constitutional rules on equality .
that ’ s just what the president meant .
but many people obviously didn ’ t understand him . peter philipp -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france to ban religious symbols from schools french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools .

demand among investors for chinese companies has surged as economic growth exploded to more than 8 % a year .
the country 's banking industry , however , has been blighted by years of bad lending , saddling the companies with masses of unpaid loans .
china 's top four banks estimate that about one in five loans is bad .

state-owned bank of china and china construction bank received the 45bn , taken from the country 's foreign currency reserves , at the end of last year .
that should bring their bad loans down to about 10 % of total lending .
ideally , that figure would drop to single digits before any stock market listing .
the chinese government has said it plans to bring its four biggest banks to the market in 2006 , though there have been signals that it may happen more quickly .
investors are keen to get exposure to one of the world 's fastest growing and largest markets .
shake off at the same time , the government wants its leading industries to shake off an image for bad management and cronyism .
when shares in china life , the country 's biggest life insurance company , began trading in new york last year , they surged by almost 30 % .
the $ 3bn flotation was the biggest in the world last year .

the man was one of thousands of moroccan soldiers captured during the war for control of western sahara .
he told moroccan tv that he knew his beloved would wait .
after his release in november he rushed back to his hometown to find her .
" i had blind confidence in her since the first day we met , " he said .
the man was identified only as abderrahim .
his new bride - bahia - told the station she always believed he would return .
" i never thought i had lost my husband , " she said .
" i knew he 'd come back one day .
i never showed pain but hid it deep in my heart . "
prisoners ' plight the plight of the moroccan prisoners-of-war , held in the desert town of tindouf in algeria , has recently attracted renewed international attention .
a report by a french-based human rights group said the prisoners had been subjected to near-starvation and torture .
the report sparked numerous calls for their captors , the polisario front - the independence movement for western sahara - to release the last few hundred soldiers they hold .
the bbc 's sebastian usher in rabat says that for many prisoners , coming back home has not been as easy as it has for abderrahim - one of about 300 released last november .
returning as elderly or sick men to a world with little place for them , many complain of being ignored by the moroccan authorities .
however , our correspondent adds , that has begun to change - with stories like abderrahim 's being shown on national television .

cancer , mental health and children 's care are some of the areas being focused on by the welsh assembly government .
health minister jane hutt , claims targets help policy makers and health professionals concentrate help on the areas that need it most .
ms hutt will set the targets following meetings with local health boards and nhs trusts in cardiff bay on tuesday .
targets to reduce the number of deaths from one of wales ' biggest killers , coronary heart disease , are already in place .
a substantial drop in the number of deaths is being aimed for by 2012 .
one scheme aimed at helping to achieve the target is a project to cut coronary heart disease among travellers - a group which has a life expectancy 10 years shorter than the wider population .
travelling people have a higher incidence of heart disease and they die about 10 to 12 years before the settled population janine de-gale health workers are advising travellers in wrexham on how to improve their diet in an effort to cut the rate of heart disease in the travelling community .
traveller florence berry changed her family 's diet after her husband mick suffered a heart attack .
she told bbc wales that health visitors from wrexham travellers health project visited the travellers ' site in a van to offer healthy eating advice .
" we now eat porridge , fruit and salads , before that it was junk food .
" chips , burgers , crisps , sweets , but now we 've cut all that down due to the health visitors helping us with the van and advising us .
" it 's very important because travelling people do n't go to the doctors .
" with the van , we know it 's there . "
financed by the welsh assembly 's health inequalities fund , the three-year project aims to educate the travelling community about a healthy diet and exercise and provides health screening .
health checks are offered to travellers under the scheme health worker janine de-gale , who offers advice to the 200 travellers in the wrexham area says she has already seen some improvements .
" travelling people have a higher incidence of heart disease and they die about 10 to 12 years before the settled population .
" the project is about screening for heart disease and giving information to try to encourage people to have healthy lives .
" if there 's someone who can be an advocate for travellers , they are very receptive .
although the main aim of this programme is to cut the number of cases of coronary heart disease among travellers , the mobile unit has become a place where women from the community can discuss health issues .
mrs berry said : " the travelling girls do n't talk to their parents about their health problems .
" now , they can go into the van and talk to the health visitors . "
the project , the first of its kind in wales , is being monitored closely .
just a year after the scheme was set up , 95 % of wrexham 's travellers are now registered with a gp .

the survey 's top five is being counted down every day this week with the winner and full top 10 published on friday .
" our songs and the music we make are going to be an unstoppable force from now on , you know what i mean ? "
this is a typical statement from razorlight singer and songwriter johnny borrell , whose supreme confidence in his band 's rip-roaring three-minute rock songs makes universal fame and acclaim sound like an easy next step .
borrell and his band come from a punkish , infectious , slightly raucous and very english school of rock that was once mastered by the clash and the jam , and has now been revived by the libertines .
borrell , 22 , does not come across as cocky , but feels that the talent in his group will make the world fall in love with them very soon .
there is little doubt , he says - it is all down to " science " .
listen to razorlight in session on bbc 6 music razorlight interview on bbci collective " you get talent and you get raw ability and you put them together and you work at it , " he says .
what comes out of the other end is an album that will " wipe the floor with a lot of records " , he says .
it has " got better songs on it than anyone 's heard on a debut album in a long , long time " .
this certainty comes after several years of graft on the north london rock circuit for borrell , who went to school with libertines bassist john hassall and sometimes played with the band as they worked their way up the scene 's ranks .
the libertines are " old mates of mine " , borrell says .
" we were always really close and i never wanted to join their band when they asked me because i 've got my own thing . "
razorlight have risen through the ranks behind the libertines but he took some time to settle on what " his own thing " was going to be .
starting as a solo artist , he was described by time out magazine as an " up and coming blues boy " in november 2001 .
six months later , the same publication said he was a " poet cum rootsy songster " and von bondies singer jason stollsteimer once described borrell as an iggy pop-style singer with two tina tuner-type backing singers .
but things started to fall into place in 2002 when borrell met swedish guitarist bjorn agren after placing an advert in nme .
" bjorn 's quite an exceptional guitar player - he has this phenomenal instinct and intelligence , " borrell says .
" it was just exactly right . "
agren enlisted friend and fellow swede , bassist carl dalemo , and borrell called up the half-peruvian , half-english christian smith-pancorvo , who previously drummed for rock contenders stony sleep .
if john keats was around today , he 'd be playing the guitar johnny borrell from that point , things began to move quickly and two singles , rock ' n ' roll lies and rip it up , attracted much attention .
he sees music as the most accessible art form in the modern world and wants to use it to inspire people , he says .
" if john keats was around today , he 'd be playing the guitar , " borrell says .
" -lsb- music -rsb- is this fantastic thing where you can talk , you can tell a story , you can sing nonsense that turns people on , or you can sing something meaningful that turns people on - you can do whatever you want .
it works on every level . "
borrell describes making music as the only thing he knows how to do - his " job " - and is not just in it to live out his rock fantasies .
" i just want to dig deeper than that , and i 've always tried to dig deeper than that , " he says .
" it 's a thing that i ca n't switch off - i 'm always , always writing . "
the sound of 2004 survey was compiled from the tips of almost 60 impartial music critics and broadcasters , who were asked to give three names of artists they thought would be successful in 2004 .
the artists who got the most tips were then ranked in order to compile the sound of 2004 list .

while you were away the new communications super-regulator ofcom chose that dead time between christmas and new year to come into being .
it has consigned its five predecessors -lrb- including the independent television commission and the radio authority -rrb- to history .
ofcom started work on 29 december it marked its " vesting day " , 29 december , with an announcement that it had allocated a band of radio frequencies also used by the mod and tv outside broadcasts to establish " wireless broadband " services , so that people in rural areas can enjoy high-speed internet access .
but this modest initiative belies the new body 's enormous sweep , covering the whole of telecommunications and broadcasting , from the issuing of licences through the oversight of the workings of the market to the policing of programme standards .
and it obscures the fact that the bbc , nominally still independently-regulated by its own board of governors , is much more beholden to the new body than it was to its predecessors .
like the broadcasting standards commission , ofcom will handle complaints about programme standards and complaints about unfair treatment and invasions of privacy .
ofcom can fine the bbc up to £ 250,000 for breaches of its codes unlike the bsc , ofcom has the power to levy fines on the corporation of up to £ 250,000 for breaches of its codes .
those include a code on programme standards -lrb- currently being drawn up -rrb- which is meant to protect children , ensure impartial and accurate news , ban incitement to crime or antisocial behaviour , protect us all against " offensive and harmful material " .
it will also regulate religious programmes , essentially to make sure they neither exploit their audiences nor abuse rival religions .
the threat of fines has prompted the beeb for the first time to introduce a " compliance form " for pre-recorded programmes , to be completed by editors or executive producers .
it highlights any content that may be contentious or offensive and details approvals sought from channel controllers , lawyers and so on during the programme 's making .
to some this represents a long-overdue tightening of procedures to ensure that the bbc does in reality what it has always claimed to do in theory - namely produce accurate , well-made programmes with the greatest care and to the highest standard .
it acts as a one-stop shop for media regulation to others it is a bureaucratic imposition on hard-pressed middle managers , and another example of the box-ticking in pursuit of " quality " which has infected much of the public sector .
but there are other areas besides programme standards in which ofcom 's remit extends to the bbc .
they include guidelines on dealings with independent producers and the policing of the " independent quota " under which broadcasters must commission at least a quarter of their programmes from independents .
for the last three years the bbc has fallen short of its obligatory 25 % : if that happens in future ofcom will be able to roll-over the unused portion to the following year and insist that even more programmes are made by indies .
number-crunchers and besides day-to-day regulation , the bbc will also be affected by ofcom 's review of public service broadcasting which will take up much of this year .
it is intended to dovetail with the government 's own review of the bbc charter under lord burns .
ed richards , the former bbc and downing street policy wonk who is now ofcom 's senior partner for strategy and market developments , says the review will be a serious attempt to define what public service broadcasting is and how it might develop in the future .
his starting point is its cost , which ofcom puts at £ 4bn a year .
mr richards says the public deserves a clearer idea of what it is getting for its money , but says the new regulator has not been taken over by the number-crunchers and is fully alive to the less readily quantifiable qualities of public service broadcasting .
and he promises the review will " engage fully " with issues of the bbc 's scale , funding , role and remit .
that really is something new .
the big questions have been asked often enough about the bbc by government committees of inquiry and royal commissions , but never by a mere regulator .

like the broadcasting standards commission , ofcom will handle complaints about programme standards and complaints about unfair treatment and invasions of privacy .
ofcom can fine the bbc up to £ 250,000 for breaches of its codes unlike the bsc , ofcom has the power to levy fines on the corporation of up to £ 250,000 for breaches of its codes .
those include a code on programme standards -lrb- currently being drawn up -rrb- which is meant to protect children , ensure impartial and accurate news , ban incitement to crime or antisocial behaviour , protect us all against " offensive and harmful material " .
it will also regulate religious programmes , essentially to make sure they neither exploit their audiences nor abuse rival religions .
the threat of fines has prompted the beeb for the first time to introduce a " compliance form " for pre-recorded programmes , to be completed by editors or executive producers .
it highlights any content that may be contentious or offensive and details approvals sought from channel controllers , lawyers and so on during the programme 's making .

they include guidelines on dealings with independent producers and the policing of the " independent quota " under which broadcasters must commission at least a quarter of their programmes from independents .
for the last three years the bbc has fallen short of its obligatory 25 % : if that happens in future ofcom will be able to roll-over the unused portion to the following year and insist that even more programmes are made by indies .
number-crunchers and besides day-to-day regulation , the bbc will also be affected by ofcom 's review of public service broadcasting which will take up much of this year .
it is intended to dovetail with the government 's own review of the bbc charter under lord burns .
ed richards , the former bbc and downing street policy wonk who is now ofcom 's senior partner for strategy and market developments , says the review will be a serious attempt to define what public service broadcasting is and how it might develop in the future .
his starting point is its cost , which ofcom puts at £ 4bn a year .
mr richards says the public deserves a clearer idea of what it is getting for its money , but says the new regulator has not been taken over by the number-crunchers and is fully alive to the less readily quantifiable qualities of public service broadcasting .
and he promises the review will " engage fully " with issues of the bbc 's scale , funding , role and remit .
that really is something new .
the big questions have been asked often enough about the bbc by government committees of inquiry and royal commissions , but never by a mere regulator .

people between the ages of 35 and 40 are the only group unlikely to be deemed too old or too young for a job .
the chartered institute of personnel & development -lrb- cipd -rrb- said one in 12 people under 35 had been told they were too young for a job , while age bias was worse for over 40-year-olds .
age discrimination is banned in the uk from 2006 , with firms urged to act now .
golden age within three years , british employers will be acting illegally if they let age prejudice their recruitment or treatment of workers .
key figures one in five put off from applying for a job because of age rules in an advert 8 % of under-35s have been told they are too young for a job 15 % of workers have experience discrimination of some kind during a job interview over a third of workers over 50 have experienced age bias at work 40 % of all workers have been discriminated at work .
age is cited as the main reason for discrimination in a third of all cases this is because the government must implement european legislation banning age discrimination by december 2006 .
the cipd , which carried out the research , is urging employers to change their attitudes and procedures before the legislation comes into force .
" waiting for legislation - which in itself could trigger knee-jerk , damage-limitation responses - will be too late , and may leave companies exposed to legal risks , " it warned .
by 2050 , there will be only two working people to support every pensioner .
it is estimated that if older people were not discriminated against , the uk economy would benefit by more than £ 30bn a year .
experts are now eagerly awaiting the publication of draft regulations in spring 2004 .
have you suffered from age discrimination in the workplace ?
is your employer changing its ways in advance of new legislation in 2006 ?
or are they still in the dark ages when it comes to attitudes towards a worker 's age ?
send in your comments : constantly suffering from age discrimination particularly when applying for positions ever since i returned to this country from working overseas at the grand old age of 48 ! !
for 4 years it has continued .
when will employers realise that a qualified , experienced and mature person in their early 50 's can bring so much to their company and is likely to have more staying power than a 30-something who is going to be looking for pastures / promotion new after a couple of years .
i am open to any offers of permanent employment where my background , knowledge , experience , adaptability and staying power will be seen as a positive benefit ! !
paul verdeyen , kidderminster u.k. my cv does n't have my date of birth on it -lrb- i 'm 36 -rrb- .
at an interview last year i was told at the beginning that they were expecting someone older from the experience and job history on my cv .
needless to say the interview was short and i did n't get the job .
hard to see how this type of discrimination will be overcome .
jacky cumberland , orpington , kent 35 to 40 ?
in it where i work i 'm already considered over the hill at 36 !
so much for that piece of ' research ' then - and the sooner the age discrimination bill comes in the better as far as i am concerned .
caroline , london , uk having taken early retirement at 53 i was told by one recruitment consultant that he had several well paid jobs i could fit into perfectly with my many years of experience .
unfortunately i would n't get any of them as i was considered to old by employers .
colin shepherd , farnham uk i 'm 57 and looking for a new position .
recent enquiries to various agencies have all been okay until we get to the age issue and then its " you would not fit in to the dynamic team they are building " or " we are not getting a response from our client on over 45 year olds " .
i belive all the rules and regulations in the world will not change this at all .
if they do not want older people they will find an axcuse not to employ them john , luton bedfordshire i would love to be in full-time employment , but in my 50s am considered too old - i do not include my date of birth on my cv and could pass for late 40s - to no avail .
legislation will do little to change attitudes - one only has to look at the us - where legislation is in place - but ageism is as rife as this side of the pond ann francis , kingston-upon-hull , east yorkshire , uk over the past 10 years , i am now 61 , i have not been given many opportunities for interviews , let alone the urgently needed work , for which i am both qualified and experienced .
i am part of the age concern worthy of work campaign , having appeared on local tv last year .
still i do not receive calls to work !
gwen girdwood , winchester , uk like other legislation that is supposed to protect employees from other froms of prejudice such as sex , race and pregnancy this is doomed to fail .
all the legislation does is stops an employer stating that is the reason they have not employed / promoted you .
partly this is because employers know that , in general terms , there are differences between age groups .
younger people -lrb- 18 to 25 -rrb- are seen as energetic , enthusiastic but lack experience ; people in their mid careers -lrb- 26 to 45 -rrb- are viewed as career minded , committed , and stable .
however , especially if female and they have kids they will need more time off .
older -lrb- 46 to 65 -rrb- are viewed as experienced , mature , dependable but expect higher wages and often resistant to change .
richard , london i have to openly admit to discriminating against age in a previous career when i was in a position of employing people .
it was in favour of people over 50 as i saw them as the most reliable employees who seemed to appreciate thier jobs far more than those under 40 .
i was under 35 myself at the time .
simon colliss , oxford uk in the eyes of employers i am an old 48 yet in the eyes of the fovernment i am still young and should not be considering retirement for possibly another 20 years .
the now so called " over the hill " generation born in the fifties has produced some of the best risk-takers , problem solvers and inventors ever , generating an explosion of bold innovation and new ideas .
we had freedom , failure , success and responsibility , and we learned to deal with it all .
we may not all have a degree or a documented " achievement book " but what we do have is vision , perception , passion and an understanding of how profits pay wages .
we are also not scared to question all and everything in our efforts to ensure the product or service offered is what the customer wants !
all new legislation will achieve is being invited to more interviews to simply fulfill the companies legal statistical requirements of considering all ages .
what we need is a change in attitude not legislation .
chris mccaffrey , preston lancs with the average age and the number of pensionable people increasing , employers will have no other option than to employ older people .
recruiting of younger staff may come with a premium attached due to supply and demand of labour .
ageism may not exist by 2050 due to the supply , demand and the number of jobs available .
john davies , medway , kent , england .
over 50 and i can not even get an interview .
when i left out my age and date of birth from my cv , i was contacted by the prospective employers and asked for it .

people between the ages of 35 and 40 are the only group unlikely to be deemed too old or too young for a job .
the chartered institute of personnel & development -lrb- cipd -rrb- said one in 12 people under 35 had been told they were too young for a job , while age bias was worse for over 40-year-olds .
age discrimination is banned in the uk from 2006 , with firms urged to act now .
golden age within three years , british employers will be acting illegally if they let age prejudice their recruitment or treatment of workers .
key figures one in five put off from applying for a job because of age rules in an advert 8 % of under-35s have been told they are too young for a job 15 % of workers have experience discrimination of some kind during a job interview over a third of workers over 50 have experienced age bias at work 40 % of all workers have been discriminated at work .
age is cited as the main reason for discrimination in a third of all cases this is because the government must implement european legislation banning age discrimination by december 2006 .
the cipd , which carried out the research , is urging employers to change their attitudes and procedures before the legislation comes into force .
" waiting for legislation - which in itself could trigger knee-jerk , damage-limitation responses - will be too late , and may leave companies exposed to legal risks , " it warned .
by 2050 , there will be only two working people to support every pensioner .

for 4 years it has continued .
when will employers realise that a qualified , experienced and mature person in their early 50 's can bring so much to their company and is likely to have more staying power than a 30-something who is going to be looking for pastures / promotion new after a couple of years .

recent enquiries to various agencies have all been okay until we get to the age issue and then its " you would not fit in to the dynamic team they are building " or " we are not getting a response from our client on over 45 year olds " .
i belive all the rules and regulations in the world will not change this at all .

all the legislation does is stops an employer stating that is the reason they have not employed / promoted you .

younger people -lrb- 18 to 25 -rrb- are seen as energetic , enthusiastic but lack experience ; people in their mid careers -lrb- 26 to 45 -rrb- are viewed as career minded , committed , and stable .

people between the ages of 35 and 40 are the only group unlikely to be deemed too old or too young for a job .
the chartered institute of personnel & development -lrb- cipd -rrb- said one in 12 people under 35 had been told they were too young for a job , while age bias was worse for over 40-year-olds .
age discrimination is banned in the uk from 2006 , with firms urged to act now .
golden age within three years , british employers will be acting illegally if they let age prejudice their recruitment or treatment of workers .
key figures one in five put off from applying for a job because of age rules in an advert 8 % of under-35s have been told they are too young for a job 15 % of workers have experience discrimination of some kind during a job interview over a third of workers over 50 have experienced age bias at work 40 % of all workers have been discriminated at work .
age is cited as the main reason for discrimination in a third of all cases this is because the government must implement european legislation banning age discrimination by december 2006 .
the cipd , which carried out the research , is urging employers to change their attitudes and procedures before the legislation comes into force .
" waiting for legislation - which in itself could trigger knee-jerk , damage-limitation responses - will be too late , and may leave companies exposed to legal risks , " it warned .
by 2050 , there will be only two working people to support every pensioner .
it is estimated that if older people were not discriminated against , the uk economy would benefit by more than £ 30bn a year .
experts are now eagerly awaiting the publication of draft regulations in spring 2004 .
have you suffered from age discrimination in the workplace ?
is your employer changing its ways in advance of new legislation in 2006 ?
or are they still in the dark ages when it comes to attitudes towards a worker 's age ?

when will employers realise that a qualified , experienced and mature person in their early 50 's can bring so much to their company and is likely to have more staying power than a 30-something who is going to be looking for pastures / promotion new after a couple of years .

the singer-songwriter , 59 , was wounded on sunday after trying to run after two men who allegedly stole his female companion 's purse at gunpoint .
he was admitted to the medical center of louisiana but his injuries were not considered serious .
a new orleans police spokesman said one person had been arrested , and police were still searching for the second .
davies was walking in new orleans ' french quarter at 2030 local time on sunday -lrb- 0230 monday gmt -rrb- when two men approached , police said .
he is in good spirits deke arlon , davies 's manager " he was walking east of the french quarter with a female friend , " said new orleans police spokesman captain marlon defillo .
" two men walked up .
they apparently took the female friend 's purse .
he chased them .
" one of those persons turned and shot him in the leg and we have arrested one person , " mr defillo said .
davies ' manager deke arlon said : " he 's in hospital but it is not really serious .
he should be up and about in a day or so .
" the message that came back to me was that he is in good spirits . "
police said muggings were uncommon in the french quarter , and that officers had been patrolling the streets at the time .
premier league davies 's wounding comes just days after he was awarded a cbe in the new year 's honours list .
the kinks have long been regarded as one of the uk 's best-loved bands .
they emerged early in the decade to stake their claim among the premier league of british beat bands , second only among some music fans to the beatles and rolling stones .
davies ' music personified swinging london davies ' wistful tales of love and longing , set to raucous rock riffs and melodic pop tunes , won the band a legion of young fans and established him as one of the most important songwriters of his generation .
the poetic vision of later songs such as waterloo sunset , days and autumn almanac offered a snapshot of contemporary life - and a specifically english worldview .
