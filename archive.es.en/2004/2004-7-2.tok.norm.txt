the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "

rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "

the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .

that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .

almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .

opposition members in parliament attacked the bill on another front .

almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .
24 . environmental minister jürgen trittin , who fought hard for the bill , said since floods could n't be prevented , the damage they cause had to be kept in check . " residential and retail developments in flood plains are the flood victims of tomorrow , " he said in a statement .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2004 german team still without a coach großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld is keeping the national team at arm 's length germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .
the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .

opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .

just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .

director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .

that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .

ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real holland ?
that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .
" the cabinet is n't denying traditional symbols such as clogs and tulips , " a spokesman for dutch european affairs minister atzo nicolai said in an interview .
" but nevertheless we want to portray a more modern image . "
tulips and quaint windmills might be seen as something nice , he added , but " totally nutty .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !

rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .

a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .
every year , the inhabitants donate a massive gingerbread heart to their statue of liberty . the city 's town hall , which turns 600 next year , houses both the mayor 's office as well as germany 's oldest barrel of wine in its cellar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fürst pückler-muskau park bad muskau 's fürst pückler park was put forth as a bid for " world heritage " status in a joint german-polish effort .

the microsoft contribution makes it possible for germany alone to reduce its contribution to the eu coffers by € 125 million , the german paper die welt reported .
germany in general provides a quarter of the total eu budget .
on march 24 , brussels ruled that microsoft was guilty of a so-called " abuse of dominant market position " and imposed hard-hitting sanctions on the firm .
microsoft was ordered to offer a version of its windows operating system , used on 90 percent of the world 's computers , without its media player , which allows users to play music and videos on their pcs .
microsoft is currently appealing the ruling to the european court of justice .
on thursday , the eu temporarily lifted its order until the court has a chance to hear the appeal .
a final ruling is expected within the next two months .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .

almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .
24 . environmental minister jürgen trittin , who fought hard for the bill , said since floods could n't be prevented , the damage they cause had to be kept in check . " residential and retail developments in flood plains are the flood victims of tomorrow , " he said in a statement .
even settlements along plains where dykes are in place could face a development stop .
" no one should think that dykes are a guarantee to stop flooding , " said trittin . a blow for farmers , communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border crossing point in hrensko between czech republic and germany was completely submerged in swollen elbe river farmers will have to stop planting fields near the river , unless they remain planted year round .
flood plains that are especially erosion-prone will be off limits completely beginning in 2013 .
opposition politicians estimated around 900,000 hectares of farming land will be affected . the farmer 's lobby immediately rejected the bill , saying that erosion posed no problem to flood plains . " a ban on -lrb- field planting -rrb- has nothing to do with flood protection , " the farmer 's association said in a statement .
opposition members in parliament attacked the bill on another front .
christian democratic union parliamentarian maria flachsbarth said the building ban would leave communities in a bind .
she affixed her name to a statement by the cdu 's environmental experts that called the ban " a major blow for the development possibilities of communities and agricultural businesses .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .

the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .

brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .

money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.07.2004 dutch outline goals for eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch take the reins on july 1 the netherlands ' turn hosting the eu presidency comes during a period of transition in brussels .
the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .

the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .

director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .

the microsoft contribution makes it possible for germany alone to reduce its contribution to the eu coffers by € 125 million , the german paper die welt reported .
germany in general provides a quarter of the total eu budget .
on march 24 , brussels ruled that microsoft was guilty of a so-called " abuse of dominant market position " and imposed hard-hitting sanctions on the firm .
microsoft was ordered to offer a version of its windows operating system , used on 90 percent of the world 's computers , without its media player , which allows users to play music and videos on their pcs .
microsoft is currently appealing the ruling to the european court of justice .
on thursday , the eu temporarily lifted its order until the court has a chance to hear the appeal .
a final ruling is expected within the next two months .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .

ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "

the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

the microsoft contribution makes it possible for germany alone to reduce its contribution to the eu coffers by € 125 million , the german paper die welt reported .
germany in general provides a quarter of the total eu budget .
on march 24 , brussels ruled that microsoft was guilty of a so-called " abuse of dominant market position " and imposed hard-hitting sanctions on the firm .
microsoft was ordered to offer a version of its windows operating system , used on 90 percent of the world 's computers , without its media player , which allows users to play music and videos on their pcs .
microsoft is currently appealing the ruling to the european court of justice .
on thursday , the eu temporarily lifted its order until the court has a chance to hear the appeal .
a final ruling is expected within the next two months .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real holland ?
that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .
" the cabinet is n't denying traditional symbols such as clogs and tulips , " a spokesman for dutch european affairs minister atzo nicolai said in an interview .
" but nevertheless we want to portray a more modern image . "
tulips and quaint windmills might be seen as something nice , he added , but " totally nutty .

the microsoft contribution makes it possible for germany alone to reduce its contribution to the eu coffers by € 125 million , the german paper die welt reported .
germany in general provides a quarter of the total eu budget .
on march 24 , brussels ruled that microsoft was guilty of a so-called " abuse of dominant market position " and imposed hard-hitting sanctions on the firm .
microsoft was ordered to offer a version of its windows operating system , used on 90 percent of the world 's computers , without its media player , which allows users to play music and videos on their pcs .
microsoft is currently appealing the ruling to the european court of justice .
on thursday , the eu temporarily lifted its order until the court has a chance to hear the appeal .
a final ruling is expected within the next two months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.07.2004 dutch outline goals for eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch take the reins on july 1 the netherlands ' turn hosting the eu presidency comes during a period of transition in brussels .
the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real holland ?
that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .
" the cabinet is n't denying traditional symbols such as clogs and tulips , " a spokesman for dutch european affairs minister atzo nicolai said in an interview .
" but nevertheless we want to portray a more modern image . "

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .
every year , the inhabitants donate a massive gingerbread heart to their statue of liberty . the city 's town hall , which turns 600 next year , houses both the mayor 's office as well as germany 's oldest barrel of wine in its cellar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fürst pückler-muskau park bad muskau 's fürst pückler park was put forth as a bid for " world heritage " status in a joint german-polish effort .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2004 german team still without a coach großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld is keeping the national team at arm 's length germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .
the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .
every year , the inhabitants donate a massive gingerbread heart to their statue of liberty . the city 's town hall , which turns 600 next year , houses both the mayor 's office as well as germany 's oldest barrel of wine in its cellar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fürst pückler-muskau park bad muskau 's fürst pückler park was put forth as a bid for " world heritage " status in a joint german-polish effort .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "

rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .

rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .

a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .
24 . environmental minister jürgen trittin , who fought hard for the bill , said since floods could n't be prevented , the damage they cause had to be kept in check . " residential and retail developments in flood plains are the flood victims of tomorrow , " he said in a statement .
even settlements along plains where dykes are in place could face a development stop .
" no one should think that dykes are a guarantee to stop flooding , " said trittin . a blow for farmers , communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border crossing point in hrensko between czech republic and germany was completely submerged in swollen elbe river farmers will have to stop planting fields near the river , unless they remain planted year round .
flood plains that are especially erosion-prone will be off limits completely beginning in 2013 .
opposition politicians estimated around 900,000 hectares of farming land will be affected . the farmer 's lobby immediately rejected the bill , saying that erosion posed no problem to flood plains . " a ban on -lrb- field planting -rrb- has nothing to do with flood protection , " the farmer 's association said in a statement .
opposition members in parliament attacked the bill on another front .
christian democratic union parliamentarian maria flachsbarth said the building ban would leave communities in a bind .
she affixed her name to a statement by the cdu 's environmental experts that called the ban " a major blow for the development possibilities of communities and agricultural businesses .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .
24 . environmental minister jürgen trittin , who fought hard for the bill , said since floods could n't be prevented , the damage they cause had to be kept in check . " residential and retail developments in flood plains are the flood victims of tomorrow , " he said in a statement .
even settlements along plains where dykes are in place could face a development stop .
" no one should think that dykes are a guarantee to stop flooding , " said trittin . a blow for farmers , communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border crossing point in hrensko between czech republic and germany was completely submerged in swollen elbe river farmers will have to stop planting fields near the river , unless they remain planted year round .
flood plains that are especially erosion-prone will be off limits completely beginning in 2013 .
opposition politicians estimated around 900,000 hectares of farming land will be affected . the farmer 's lobby immediately rejected the bill , saying that erosion posed no problem to flood plains . " a ban on -lrb- field planting -rrb- has nothing to do with flood protection , " the farmer 's association said in a statement .
opposition members in parliament attacked the bill on another front .
christian democratic union parliamentarian maria flachsbarth said the building ban would leave communities in a bind .
she affixed her name to a statement by the cdu 's environmental experts that called the ban " a major blow for the development possibilities of communities and agricultural businesses .

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .
every year , the inhabitants donate a massive gingerbread heart to their statue of liberty . the city 's town hall , which turns 600 next year , houses both the mayor 's office as well as germany 's oldest barrel of wine in its cellar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fürst pückler-muskau park bad muskau 's fürst pückler park was put forth as a bid for " world heritage " status in a joint german-polish effort .

the microsoft contribution makes it possible for germany alone to reduce its contribution to the eu coffers by € 125 million , the german paper die welt reported .
germany in general provides a quarter of the total eu budget .
on march 24 , brussels ruled that microsoft was guilty of a so-called " abuse of dominant market position " and imposed hard-hitting sanctions on the firm .
microsoft was ordered to offer a version of its windows operating system , used on 90 percent of the world 's computers , without its media player , which allows users to play music and videos on their pcs .
microsoft is currently appealing the ruling to the european court of justice .
on thursday , the eu temporarily lifted its order until the court has a chance to hear the appeal .
a final ruling is expected within the next two months .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "

" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .

" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .

a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .

speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .

rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .

rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "

" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !

rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .

" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real holland ?
that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .
" the cabinet is n't denying traditional symbols such as clogs and tulips , " a spokesman for dutch european affairs minister atzo nicolai said in an interview .
" but nevertheless we want to portray a more modern image . "

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .

the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "

the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .

that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .

tui officials on friday said the hanover customer base could not carry another discount airline and added they would shift operations to nearby hamburg instead .
lower saxonian premier christian wulff , a christian democrat , had already said that the state capital 's airport should not try to attract new airlines at the risk of losing others .
lower saxony holds a 35 percent stake in hanover 's airport , with the city of hanover holding the same amount and another 30 percent owned by frankfurt airport 's managing company , fraport .
easyjet began flying to munich several years ago , but it has dramatically expanded its german flights this year with new services to and from berlin -lrb- schönefeld -rrb- , cologne / bonn and dortmund airports . dw-world.de jetting around more responsibly budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .

tui officials on friday said the hanover customer base could not carry another discount airline and added they would shift operations to nearby hamburg instead .
lower saxonian premier christian wulff , a christian democrat , had already said that the state capital 's airport should not try to attract new airlines at the risk of losing others .
lower saxony holds a 35 percent stake in hanover 's airport , with the city of hanover holding the same amount and another 30 percent owned by frankfurt airport 's managing company , fraport .

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .

a hamburg administrative court issued a temporary injunction this week against the european consortium 's plan to extend the runway at its plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder district by 600 meters -lrb- 1,968 feet -rrb- in order to accommodate the cargo version of its new a380 jumbo jet .
the court said that an earlier plan by the company to extend the runway by 589 meters would be sufficient for the aircraft to take off and land .
however , airbus said the extra length would be required to demonstrate the plane to customers , who demand to see the aircraft fly when it is two-thirds filled .
the new plan , the court said , would require property to be expropriated from 20 different residents .
most of the construction of the a380 is expected to happen at airbus plants in toulouse , france , and at hamburg-finkenwerder .
a higher administrative court is expected to rule on the issue soon .
with the first plane scheduled for delivery in 2006 , airbus is under tight deadline pressure to complete the a380 , which is intended to compete with boeing 's 747 . more briefs 02.07.2004 -pipe- starbucks in germany stuck in the red 01.07.2004 -pipe- european central bank to leave interest rates unchanged 01.07.2004 -pipe- t-mobile to put the beat in its phones 30.06.2004 -pipe- prosecutors demand jail time for mannesmann execs 30.06.2004 -pipe- baden-württemberg may allow 24-hour shopping 30.06.2004 -pipe- court says deutsche post ca n't film employees 29.06.2004 -pipe- karstadt-quelle moves on rewe joint venture 29.06.2004 -pipe- economy to grow 1.8 percent in 2004 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a hamburg administrative court issued a temporary injunction this week against the european consortium 's plan to extend the runway at its plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder district by 600 meters -lrb- 1,968 feet -rrb- in order to accommodate the cargo version of its new a380 jumbo jet .
the court said that an earlier plan by the company to extend the runway by 589 meters would be sufficient for the aircraft to take off and land .
however , airbus said the extra length would be required to demonstrate the plane to customers , who demand to see the aircraft fly when it is two-thirds filled .
the new plan , the court said , would require property to be expropriated from 20 different residents .

the microsoft contribution makes it possible for germany alone to reduce its contribution to the eu coffers by € 125 million , the german paper die welt reported .
germany in general provides a quarter of the total eu budget .
on march 24 , brussels ruled that microsoft was guilty of a so-called " abuse of dominant market position " and imposed hard-hitting sanctions on the firm .
microsoft was ordered to offer a version of its windows operating system , used on 90 percent of the world 's computers , without its media player , which allows users to play music and videos on their pcs .
microsoft is currently appealing the ruling to the european court of justice .
on thursday , the eu temporarily lifted its order until the court has a chance to hear the appeal .
a final ruling is expected within the next two months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.07.2004 dutch outline goals for eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch take the reins on july 1 the netherlands ' turn hosting the eu presidency comes during a period of transition in brussels .
the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real holland ?
that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .
" the cabinet is n't denying traditional symbols such as clogs and tulips , " a spokesman for dutch european affairs minister atzo nicolai said in an interview .
" but nevertheless we want to portray a more modern image . "
tulips and quaint windmills might be seen as something nice , he added , but " totally nutty .

a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .
the future direction of the cloister is at issue : should the monks continue on a market-oriented path or return to a traditional life ? among beer aficionados for whom the consumption of beer is a near religious-like experience , the andechs monastery , located in the mountains of bavaria a half an hour 's drive from munich , is an important pilgrimage sight . here , 23 monks oversee the production of seven famous varieties of much-loved beer , all sold under the monastery 's andechs label .
sold around the world , its success has spawned numerous other businesses , including restaurants . now a power struggle between two high-ranking members of the order has pitted one monk against the other in a battle over the monastery 's future .
at the heart of the issue is whether the monks - and the monastery - should focus more on a traditional life of quiet reflection and less on profit-driven business ventures . brother against brother abbot johannes eckert , the recently-elected head of the st. bonifaz monastery in munich which the andechs is subordinate to , has a conservative opinion on the matter , while the prior of andechs , anselm bilgri , the business-savvy monk largely credited with the monastery 's success , has another .
jürgen schott , the business manager of andechs ' culture and events gmbh , has been caught in the crossfire . tensions flared a little over a year ago when father eckert was unexpectedly elected to the top position at st. bonifaz , beating out the older bilgri , who many thought was next in line .
taken aback , bilgri retreated for a sabbatical year " to reflect " . but that has not prevented the battle from raging on in his absence .
recently , schott , bilgri 's confidant and supporter who organizes the monastery 's summer culture festival , has been barred from the premises following accusations that he fraudulently misused the monastery 's funds to pay for , among other things , a trip to mallorca . monks in mallorca schott has vehemently denied the allegations and submitted an action for an injunction appealing to the regional courts to rule on the lawfulness of the ban and grant him access to the monastery .
about the trip to mallorca , he says it was for business and approved by bilgri . on thursday , the third civil division of the munich state court ruled against schott on a technicality : the monastery-related business venture , culture and events gmbh , which schott led , did not have a rental agreement with the monastery , and , thus , he had no right to continue to work on the grounds .
but that , obviously , presents a problem for schott , since the summer festival which he organizes as head of the division , takes place there . " i want to leave , andechs has lost its meaning for me , " said schott after the ruling .
" the monastery no longer provides me with inspiration " . but by pushing out the likes of bilgri and company , father eckert is hoping to inspire a generation of monks to return to a more conventional life , one based more on religious reflection and less on the bottom line . the " battle of the monks " , as the german tabloids have dubbed the conflict , could have far reaching implications for fans of andechs ' special brew . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crying in your beer german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .

the decision left the german soccer world in turmoil just two years before the world cup . ottmar hitzfeld , the former bayern munich coach , on wednesday stunned the german soccer world by turning down the opportunity to succeed rudi völler , who resigned after his team exited the european soccer championships in the first round .
hitzfeld 's appointment this week was considered a sure bet by many .
" it was just the wrong time , " said hitzfeld , who said he was completely burned out after coaching six seasons in munich .
had the soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- asked him " a year later , then i would have probably been ready . "
caught off guard dfb head gerhard mayer-vorfelder who spoke on the phone with hitzfeld for 40 minutes , said he could accept his decision and admitted to reporters that he " did n't have a plan b. "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder was stunned by the position " i can understand him , because i 'm also friends with him , " said mayer-vorfelder .
" but i deeply regret the decision . "
speculation is already rife on who the germans might turn to next with just two years remaining before the country hosts the world cup .
the rumor mill has so far churned out former bayer leverkusen coach christoph daum as well as former national team star lothar matthaues as possible candidates .
a hot bet at the moment is otto rehhagel , who has stunned the european soccer world by taking greece to the finals of the tournament against portugal .
' king otto ' not interested - yet " greece in the final !
now rehhacles must rescue germany , " the mass daily bild splashed across the front page on friday .
rehhagel , dubbed " rehhacles " in a play on heracles by the german press , has taken his underdogs on a sensational march through the tournament .
they have beaten portugal , france and the czech republic to advance to the final .
rehhagel , who has had successful coaching stints at fc kaiserslautern and sv werder bremen , has so far reacted coolly to a move back to germany . the 65-year-old had been passed over as national team coach before , and bad blood remains between him and some dfb officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's coach otto rehhagel took his team farther than the germans " all of my thoughts right now are with my players , " rehhagel told the wire service dpa .
" the team now has the right to be happy about our success , and i am obligated to only talk about my team and their problems . "
daum , 50 , is considered among the best qualified to lead the team but was passed over before in 2000-2001 , when he admitted to using cocaine .
the scandal cost daum his job as bayer leverkusen coach and made him into a persona non grata in germany . he now coaches fenerbache in istanbul and analysts think a move back to germany is unlikely .
a dane coaching germans ?
a myriad of other options have already been bandied about .
most interesting would be the possibility that germany breaks with tradition and hires a foreign coach .
mayer-vorfelder told reporters he would n't rule out the possibility , but that the coach would have to speak fluent german .
candidates in that pool include frenchman arsene wenger , currently coach at arsenal london , morten olsen , danish national team coach and holland 's guss hiddink , who currently coaches psv eindhoven . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bouncing czechs and the legend of rehhacles the in-form team of the tournament take on the surprise package in the second of euro 2004 's semi-finals on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.07.2004 germany moves to limit flood damage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : towns along the elbe were devastated by the flood more than two years after floods caused billions of euros in damage to parts of eastern germany , the federal parliament passed a law that seeks to lessen the damage should the floods come again . for property owners along the elbe river , august 2002 was a devastating month . record floods swept away family homes , gardens and possessions , leaving more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- in damage along the banks of the winding elbe river from prague to brandenburg .
almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .
24 . environmental minister jürgen trittin , who fought hard for the bill , said since floods could n't be prevented , the damage they cause had to be kept in check . " residential and retail developments in flood plains are the flood victims of tomorrow , " he said in a statement .
even settlements along plains where dykes are in place could face a development stop .
" no one should think that dykes are a guarantee to stop flooding , " said trittin . a blow for farmers , communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border crossing point in hrensko between czech republic and germany was completely submerged in swollen elbe river farmers will have to stop planting fields near the river , unless they remain planted year round .
flood plains that are especially erosion-prone will be off limits completely beginning in 2013 .
opposition politicians estimated around 900,000 hectares of farming land will be affected . the farmer 's lobby immediately rejected the bill , saying that erosion posed no problem to flood plains . " a ban on -lrb- field planting -rrb- has nothing to do with flood protection , " the farmer 's association said in a statement .
opposition members in parliament attacked the bill on another front .

almost immediately chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet began discussing a law that would limit property development along the river . on friday , the results of those discussions won parliamentary approval : the bill foresees a ban on new construction in flood plains along the elbe river , and allows farmers to plant their fields next to the river only under certain conditions .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , will discuss the bill on sept .

flood plains that are especially erosion-prone will be off limits completely beginning in 2013 .

the dutch agenda includes tackling the question of turkey 's eu desires and boosting turnout in european elections . when the netherlands takes the helm of the eu on thursday , brussels is going to be a quieter place than usual .
a new european parliament , just voted in in june , will still be in its organizational phase .
the european commission will be winding down ; its term ends in october and several members have already returned to postings in their home countries .
despite the low activity level - dutch eu ambassador tom de bruijn even admitted the presidency was taking place at a " rather difficult time " - the netherlands said it has set itself a full agenda for the next six months and wants to address a series of core issues , some which have been on the back burner for years .
turkey one divisive topic , however , which is increasingly on everyone 's mind and will come to a head later this year , is the issue of turkey 's bid to join the european bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four former kurdish lawmakers were released from prison , a critical step as turkey faces european union pressure to grant more rights to kurds and improve its human rights record .
ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "

the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .

ankara has been an officially recognized candidate for eu membership since 1999 and over the last few years , has put in place a series of wide-ranging reforms - such as abolishing the death penalty and changing policies regarding its kurdish minority -lrb- photo -rrb- - meant to put it in sync with eu institutions and meet the so-called copenhagen criteria , a strict set of standards developed by the eu in areas such as human rights , the rule of law , and the rights of minorities .
opinion over turkey 's readiness to start the eu accession process or even its suitability for eu membership in the first place is sharply divided among existing members .
a dutch newspaper has recently written : " turkey is the hot potato on the netherlands ' plate . "
the european commission is set to release a report on turkey 's democratization process in october and european leaders will decide at a summit in december whether the eu is ready to start accession talks with turkey .
the dutch have said they want to make sure the decision over turkey is " fair , transparent and sustainable , " according to foreign minister bernard bot when he presented the dutch priorities for the eu presidency last week .
" turkey has made considerable progress in a relatively short time span , " he said .
" i am confident that further progress will be made in the coming six months . "
get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's election committee worker kristine kramina , right , helps bruno vilhelms gailis and his wife austra to vote in european parliament elections at home in riga , latvia .
the dutch take the reins just after the disastrous voter turnout in june european parliament elections .
just 45.5 percent of the 350 million eligible voters bothered to cast ballots .
according to bot , the netherlands must use its time in the top spot to " explore new ways of communicating europe in order to keep the public on board . "
according to many analysts , many europeans have a poor understanding of what the eu does , and what kind of role it plays in their everyday lives .
brussels is seen as a far-away bureaucracy with limited democratic credentials .
however , for some dutch , the way to increase voter satisfaction and participation is be curbing some of brussels ' power .
bot has suggested some areas of policy that are now decided at the eu level could be transferred back to eu member states .
money , security and the everyday other areas of interest for the dutch include reviving plans to increase the future economic heft of the 25-member bloc , a strategy that was agreed on at an eu summit in lisbon , but which has not been aggressively pursued since .
the so-called lisbon strategy aims to make the eu the world 's leading economy by 2010 .
in the wake of the war in iraq and the march 11 bombings in madrid , security will play large during the next six months , according to the dutch , who want the eu to get tougher on terrorism .
the hague has also expressed the desire to come up with a common european asylum policy .
less sexy , but equally important , is finding new and more efficient ways of managing day-to-day affairs in the newly enlarged union .
director of the dutch bureau for the european parliament , sjerp van der vaart , said the hague should concentrate on " making the council 's with 25 more effective by making new rules of procedure . "
there have been worries that adding 10 members to the bloc could result in decision-making logjams or even paralysis .
cut the clichés , please the dutch are eager to show that , although a small nation , they are up to the task of guiding the union through a challenging transitional time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real holland ?
that means they are also eager to avoid some of the symbols that have long been associated with the water-logged country - namely , windmills , tulips and the ubiquitous wooden shoes .
" the cabinet is n't denying traditional symbols such as clogs and tulips , " a spokesman for dutch european affairs minister atzo nicolai said in an interview .
" but nevertheless we want to portray a more modern image . "
tulips and quaint windmills might be seen as something nice , he added , but " totally nutty .

they include spots such as the cologne cathedral , the classical weimar of goethe and schiller , berlin 's museum island and the towns of eisleben and wittenberg that are associated with martin luther . " an image-boost " unesco 's decision has been greeted with delight by officials in germany .
dresden mayor ingolf rossberg said it was an internationally significant honor for the elbe valley , renowned for its stunning blend of nature and architecture and added he hoped the " world heritage " status would " provide an impetus , particularly in tourism . " " it 's like being exalted to knighthood , " said saxony 's culture and science minister matthias rößler .
he also stressed that the entire eastern german state of saxony would profit from the image-boost bestowed by the worldwide coveted quality seal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall bremen mayor henning scherf described the decision as " a wonderful piece of news and a great honor for the city of which we are very proud . " " florence of the elbe " dresden , the capital of saxony and also known as " florence of the elbe " , had justified its bid to the unesco world heritage site list two years ago by pointing out that nature and architecture had developed in an unusually close and harmonious relationship in the elbe valley . indeed , the 20-kilometer-long valley which snakes from the southeast to the northwest fringes of dresden , encompasses a rich ensemble of historic architectural monuments as well as swathes of natural reserves and river landscapes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winding elbe valley is a must-see for tourists to germany on either side of the elbe banks , traces of early settlements and burial grounds dating from the bronze and ice age , medieval villages and fortified structures from the renaissance and baroque periods as well as ornate royal residences stemming from the 19th century vie for attention . other splendors include expansive wilhelminian villas , rolling vineyards and the famous 18th century chinese-style pillnitz palace , which form the easternmost point of the winding elbe valley . enigmatic symbol of freedom bremen 's contribution to the world heritage list , the 9,61-meter-high stone statue of roland and the historic town hall with its renaissance façade , are the port city 's best-known emblems . built in 1404 , the exact identity of the giant enigmatic-looking roland at the market square still remains unknown .
what is clear though is that the towering figure is a symbol of freedom for civil society , trade , independence and individuality .
roland remains a popular figure in bremen .
every year , the inhabitants donate a massive gingerbread heart to their statue of liberty . the city 's town hall , which turns 600 next year , houses both the mayor 's office as well as germany 's oldest barrel of wine in its cellar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fürst pückler-muskau park bad muskau 's fürst pückler park was put forth as a bid for " world heritage " status in a joint german-polish effort .

electricity chiefs have published the full details of a new proposed route for the 400,000 volt super-pylons , which will march across the countryside from outside inverness to the forth valley .
the pylons will transport electricity from renewable sources such as wind farms .
but while the power company 's decision has meant relief for scores of objectors , the change of plan has sparked fury among fresh critics who now find themselves in the new path of the proposed line .
guy ' santa ' spurway grows christmas trees and hosts shooting parties on his 480-acre wester cambushinnie farm , outside dunblane .
he was a fund manager in the city of london until he returned to the family farm two years ago for a better quality of life .
i 'll lose the whole lot and it 's pretty much all my income guy spurway concerned resident he now leads an action group in the area , where objectors are furious that the pylons , more than 10 times the height of a double decker bus , are being moved away from the neighbouring village of braco - to a route next to the small community of kinbuck .
he said : " my shooting business will be completely demolished .
i 'll lose the whole lot and it 's pretty much all my income .
it 's not an exaggeration - i 'll be forced out of my shooting business completely . "
mr spurway fears there are health risks associated with the power line and said his christmas tree business would also be threatened if the bulldozers moved in to tear a path through his trees .
" if i raised a family and one of my children contracted leukaemia , i 'd never be able to live with myself .
i might as well shoot myself because i could have moved and it would n't have happened , " he said .
wallace monument " i came here for a different way of life .
the whole thing has thrown a spanner in the works . "
a few miles to the north , michael aldridge is the manager of the 60,000-acre drummond estate , near crieff .
he said : " our main concerns are the effect on landscape and conservation .
it will make a huge impact on a prime conservation area .
" the cable would cut through the core capercaillie area .
it would be pretty devastating to the landscape . "
michael aldridge has conservation concerns to the south , the giant towers will run across the historic battlefield of sheriffmuir - before passing within less than one mile of the national wallace monument in the centre of braveheart country - overlooking the village of blairlogie , outside stirling .
protesters ' spokesman peter pearson claims the power line would be sited within 50 metres of one house in the area .
he pledged : " there will be as much criticism of the new route as there was of the old one . "
the row has been sparked by the decision by scottish executive ministers to produce 40 % of electricity from renewable sources , such as wind farms , by 2020 - twice the uk 's target .
the power line - with pylons every 300 metres - is aimed at carrying green electricity from beauly in the north , to denny in the central belt .
msps this week called for a shift from wind farms to wave and tidal power .
to put a line of this particularly high voltage underground would require a trench the width of a motorway and would raise the cost dr keith maclean scottish and southern electricity expert in environmental economics at glasgow university , professor nick hanley , described the views of the enterprise committee as " pretty sensible " .
he said : " if the scottish executive hits its 40 % target it would likely be producing the highest percentage of renewable energy in the eu .
the target is also very ambitious at the global scale .
" unless we manage to reduce the cost of offshore wind farms or realise significant tidal energy investments , it is not clear how we will hit this 40 % target at present . "
prof hanley added : " what is driving the development of on-shore wind farms is the profit motive , spurred by renewable obligation credits , or ' green credits ' , which are a pretty massive incentive for the private sector .
" one of the unfortunate things about current wind farm construction is that there is no overall national strategy for where we put these things . "
the 160-mile power line , costing £ 200m , is being built by perth-based scottish and southern electricity - which describes itself as britain 's leader in renewable energy .
the proposals have sparked a huge debate business development manager , keith maclean , said : " for over 75 % of the route there have been no major problems .
" some people think it 's a good thing .
we have listened and made changes .
other people think it 's horrible .
wherever the line goes there 's a potential effect . "
dr maclean added : " to put a line of this particularly high voltage underground would require a trench the width of a motorway and would raise the cost .
" if there was a danger , it would not be allowed .
" we have made significant changes to the route to try to come up with something better . "

electricity chiefs have published the full details of a new proposed route for the 400,000 volt super-pylons , which will march across the countryside from outside inverness to the forth valley .
the pylons will transport electricity from renewable sources such as wind farms .
but while the power company 's decision has meant relief for scores of objectors , the change of plan has sparked fury among fresh critics who now find themselves in the new path of the proposed line .
guy ' santa ' spurway grows christmas trees and hosts shooting parties on his 480-acre wester cambushinnie farm , outside dunblane .
he was a fund manager in the city of london until he returned to the family farm two years ago for a better quality of life .
i 'll lose the whole lot and it 's pretty much all my income guy spurway concerned resident he now leads an action group in the area , where objectors are furious that the pylons , more than 10 times the height of a double decker bus , are being moved away from the neighbouring village of braco - to a route next to the small community of kinbuck .
he said : " my shooting business will be completely demolished .
i 'll lose the whole lot and it 's pretty much all my income .
it 's not an exaggeration - i 'll be forced out of my shooting business completely . "
mr spurway fears there are health risks associated with the power line and said his christmas tree business would also be threatened if the bulldozers moved in to tear a path through his trees .
" if i raised a family and one of my children contracted leukaemia , i 'd never be able to live with myself .
i might as well shoot myself because i could have moved and it would n't have happened , " he said .

a few miles to the north , michael aldridge is the manager of the 60,000-acre drummond estate , near crieff .
he said : " our main concerns are the effect on landscape and conservation .
it will make a huge impact on a prime conservation area .
" the cable would cut through the core capercaillie area .
it would be pretty devastating to the landscape . "
michael aldridge has conservation concerns to the south , the giant towers will run across the historic battlefield of sheriffmuir - before passing within less than one mile of the national wallace monument in the centre of braveheart country - overlooking the village of blairlogie , outside stirling .
protesters ' spokesman peter pearson claims the power line would be sited within 50 metres of one house in the area .
he pledged : " there will be as much criticism of the new route as there was of the old one . "
the row has been sparked by the decision by scottish executive ministers to produce 40 % of electricity from renewable sources , such as wind farms , by 2020 - twice the uk 's target .
the power line - with pylons every 300 metres - is aimed at carrying green electricity from beauly in the north , to denny in the central belt .
msps this week called for a shift from wind farms to wave and tidal power .
to put a line of this particularly high voltage underground would require a trench the width of a motorway and would raise the cost dr keith maclean scottish and southern electricity expert in environmental economics at glasgow university , professor nick hanley , described the views of the enterprise committee as " pretty sensible " .

protesters ' spokesman peter pearson claims the power line would be sited within 50 metres of one house in the area .
he pledged : " there will be as much criticism of the new route as there was of the old one . "
the row has been sparked by the decision by scottish executive ministers to produce 40 % of electricity from renewable sources , such as wind farms , by 2020 - twice the uk 's target .
the power line - with pylons every 300 metres - is aimed at carrying green electricity from beauly in the north , to denny in the central belt .
msps this week called for a shift from wind farms to wave and tidal power .
to put a line of this particularly high voltage underground would require a trench the width of a motorway and would raise the cost dr keith maclean scottish and southern electricity expert in environmental economics at glasgow university , professor nick hanley , described the views of the enterprise committee as " pretty sensible " .
he said : " if the scottish executive hits its 40 % target it would likely be producing the highest percentage of renewable energy in the eu .
the target is also very ambitious at the global scale .
" unless we manage to reduce the cost of offshore wind farms or realise significant tidal energy investments , it is not clear how we will hit this 40 % target at present . "
prof hanley added : " what is driving the development of on-shore wind farms is the profit motive , spurred by renewable obligation credits , or ' green credits ' , which are a pretty massive incentive for the private sector .
" one of the unfortunate things about current wind farm construction is that there is no overall national strategy for where we put these things . "
the 160-mile power line , costing £ 200m , is being built by perth-based scottish and southern electricity - which describes itself as britain 's leader in renewable energy .
the proposals have sparked a huge debate business development manager , keith maclean , said : " for over 75 % of the route there have been no major problems .
" some people think it 's a good thing .
we have listened and made changes .
other people think it 's horrible .
wherever the line goes there 's a potential effect . "
dr maclean added : " to put a line of this particularly high voltage underground would require a trench the width of a motorway and would raise the cost .
" if there was a danger , it would not be allowed .
" we have made significant changes to the route to try to come up with something better . "
and he warned : " do n't put us in a catch 22 position , where we 're damned if we do and damned if we do n't . "

she had lived in the city for 20 years before she went to work in the seychelles in 1999 .
but on her return , she discovered her friends had moved away , she had lost contact with others and found herself alone in a city of more than seven million people .
" when i returned things had changed , " said the mother-of-two .
" all the things i took for granted - friends , places to go and see - were n't there at a time when i really needed them .
" i came back and found myself very much on my own .
in three years a lot can change .
some friends had moved out of london , some got married , i just lost touch .
we hope to give those people who may be in that situation a sense of belonging - everybody needs that , wherever they live nichole esparon " everyone seemed to be having fun except me .
london is great - if you 've got people around you . "
so the 32-year-old began to look for alternatives .
she scanned dating websites but she wanted friendship not romance .
she also had her business networks but that did not help her social life .
ms esparon told bbc news online : " it was then i thought , ' i ca n't be the only one in this situation ' .
i also realised that there are so many people , coming into london everyday going through the same thing . "
so she began working on the friends in the city website which went live at the beginning of june .
for a subscription fee , registered users can enter their details and make online friends .
the site also organises regular events where members can meet in person .
being alone in london inspired nichole to start the website the functionality of the site is similar to dating websites but ms esparon said names like " sexy tom " were not encouraged .
she is also working with companies , such as pharmaceutical giant glaxosmithkline , who refer relocated employees to the site .
" companies want to attract and keep the best employees , " she said .
" they spend a lot of money getting them here .
but if they become bored , or their partners become bored , or if there not happy for whatever reason in london , they leave the company .
" we help their social integration and keep them at the company and keep them happy in london . "
kavita walia , 35 , a director from wembley , north london , uses the site .
she said : " i found it really useful .
although i would n't have described myself as alone in london , i have made friends through the events organised and also lots of business contacts . "
having started the project as a hobby , ms esparon has now invested about £ 12,000 , of her money into it , put her legal career on hold and , depending on its success in london , hopes to launch similar sites across the uk .
she said : " london can be a very daunting and a very lonely place .
" we hope to give those people who may be in that situation a sense of belonging - everybody needs that , wherever they live . "

of the 1,500 drivers stopped by thames valley police road policing officers and given breath tests , one in ten were found to be breaking the law .
the motorists were targeted as part of an anti-drink-drive campaign .
every year , 24 people are killed and 119 are hurt badly on berkshire and oxfordshire roads due to drink-driving .
' taking risks ' supt neil olney , head of road policing , said : " the results of this operation so far have reinforced our fears that too many drivers are still taking the risk of drinking and driving .
" they also indicate that if you risk it , you stand a very good chance of being caught .
" this operation will continue for another month , but drink and drug-driving is an issue we concentrate on all year round , and we arrest on average 17 drink-drivers every day .
" my message is clear , have none for the road , for your own sake and the sake of others . "

the price hike , which is the second in the past year , means passengers on the enterprise service are facing a 19 % increase on the cost of a day return ticket since last year .
a day return ticket rises to £ 25 , a £ 4 increase from july 2003 , while the cost of a monthly return ticket rises by £ 2 to £ 33 .
mal mcgreevy , general manager of rail services with translink , said it was " a little bit misleading " to refer to a second price hike within a year .
" we normally review prices around july each year , " he said .
" last year , it was deferrable until august , so in reality this is the second price rise , but yes it 's over a two year period . "

consumer council chief executive eleanor gill said there needed to be " open and sustainable and transparent pricing policies " .
" unfortunately , on this occasion translink have not come forward and justified to customers out there catching the train today why this increase is necessary . "

" if today is an average day , by the published figures on an independent customer satisfaction agreed with translink , 634 people leaving on the enterprise will arrive late and over 1,000 will feel this is poor value for money . "
the council has also raised concerns at the price rise ahead of a period of engineering works around dublin which will disrupt the enterprise service until may 2005 .
" the council is working hard to highlight the positive aspects of public transport to encourage people to leave their cars at home , so this is particularly bad news and will damage consumer confidence , " added ms gill .

the slowdown - triggered in part by a lack of fresh incentives in an industry now wedded to sweeteners - followed a blistering pace for sales in may .
gm sales were down 15.5 % from june 2003 , with ford sales down 11.2 % .
but japanese and other asian firms made significant gains , cementing their position as the pacemakers in the us automobile market .
toyota sales were up 5.9 % , giving it a 11.9 % share of the overall market , with nissan sales growing 9 % and korean carmaker hyundai shooting up 20.1 % .
among the european vendors , bmw had a solid month with sales up 7.9 % , but volkswagen found itself sharing the fate of gm with a slide of 15.9 % .
the sales for the year to june showed less drastic declines for the home-grown marques .
june market share gm : 27 % ford : 20.1 % daimlerchrysler : 14.7 % toyota : 11.9 % honda : 8.2 % nissan : 5.6 % hyundai : 4.1 % ford was off 4.1 % , gm down just 0.3 % and daimlerchrysler increased sales by 1.6 % .
but the asian vendors ' gains for the 12 months to june were striking : toyota up 10.5 % and nissan streaking ahead by 24.7 % .
saturation and the weak market meant june sales were down 6 % on a seasonally adjusted basis to the equivalent of 15.4 million units in a year - the worst performance since summer 1998 .
stockpiles at the big detroit motor firms is building up - even though daimlerchrysler evaded the fate of its us peers with a narrow gain in sales .
that could mean renewed effort on the part of car firms to ramp up the cut-price deals and cheap finance offers for july and august .
one culprit for the june slowdown , analysts said , was the lack of fresh incentives - the upsurge in started after the 9/11 attacks .
" there 's no question that there 's some payback from the really aggressive incentive programme , " said joe phillippi , consultant and ex-wall street analyst .

by tom carver bbc correspondent in washington john kerry will announce his running mate soon choosing his running mate is the biggest decision john kerry will make in his presidential campaign .
and by this time next week , we will probably know what the decision is .
it matters because the announcement will receive saturation coverage in the media .
people who have not given politics much thought up to now will take notice .
the choice will tell us a lot about mr kerry : whether he is a risk-taker , what he values , and how he wants to position his candidacy .
party pick among the democratic grassroots , the clear favourite is senator john edwards .
the vice presidential pack when you talk to democratic activists , they repeatedly describe mr edwards as " exciting " and " fresh " , suggesting these are qualities which they think is missing in mr kerry himself .
there are other advantages to choosing mr edwards : his southern , more socially conservative politics would help to offset mr kerry 's north-eastern liberal image .
his emphasis on domestic issues would balance mr kerry 's obvious foreign policy strengths .
his boyish charisma would add some zip to mr kerry 's ponderous stump style .
he is also the favourite with the ordinary voter .
a recent gallup poll showed that 72 % of respondents want mr edwards compared to 64 % for the former democratic leader of the house , dick gephardt - though that may just be because his is the most well known name in the frame .
edwards liabilities despite this , mr edwards could still be ruled out .
some democrats say mr kerry just does n't like mr edwards .
but he would n't be the first candidate not to get on with a running mate .
eisenhower , for instance , despised richard nixon .
a more serious claim is that mr edwards , a first-term senator , could look vulnerable on foreign policy when going toe-to-toe against vice president dick cheney .
the kerry camp may decide mr edwards wo n't deliver any of the key swing states .
or they might find something in his past which would embarrass the ticket .
but if he does n't pick mr edwards , the kerry camp will have to brace itself for an angry backlash among the grassroots .
a lot of democrats are afraid that mr kerry will end up choosing mr gephardt .
politically , it 's hard to see why mr kerry would choose him , except that he could deliver missouri , his home state .
mr gephardt is much closer to mr kerry in both substance and style .
mr kerry clearly feels more at ease with mr gephardt 's rather stolid legislator manner than mr edwards ' populism .
but choosing mr gephardt could cause a lot of the air and excitement to evaporate from the kerry campaign .
wild card candidates the john mccain rumours have stopped .
the republicans have signed him up as a keynote speaker at their convention .
i suspect that the kerry camp was never actually serious about mr mccain , but was happy to fan the rumours because it made mr kerry look more appealing to the centre ground .
in the same vein , william cohen is now being mentioned .
mr kerry could pick another vietnam veteran , wesley clark mr cohen is another republican , but unlike mr mccain , he has served in a democrat administration , as president clinton 's defence secretary .
another wild card is bob rubin , mr clinton 's treasury secretary .
these are both riskier choices because they would n't deliver any political constituency .
but president bush 's problems in iraq may make mr kerry feel more confident about taking a risk .
and if he is , he could go for a fellow vietnam veteran , wesley clark .
he has the charisma of mr edwards , but lacks the political base to threaten mr kerry .
iowa governor tom vilsack and indiana senator evan bayh are possible compromise candidates .
they are unknown outside democrat circles .
but they are popular , competent moderates - john edwards without the star wattage - and no one would complain that much if one of them received the nod .
choosing a running mate is a gruelling process .
a candidate has to be willing to subject himself -lrb- there are no women in the frame unless you include hillary clinton , who is 100/1 long shot -rrb- to intensive interviews in which everything - his sex life , his finances , his friends - is discussed .
teams of lawyers pore over every available public record from credit records to high school year books .
past girlfriends are contacted .
john kerry went through the process last time as one of the favourites for becoming al gore 's running mate .
the other unsuccessful candidate on the short list was - john edwards .
closely guarded secret less than 10 people really know who it is going to be .
mr kerry has consulted his wife , his brother , his chief of staff , his chief strategist and of course , jim johnson , the man heading the search committee , but he has successfully kept the process away from the cameras , thereby heightening the sense of anticipation .
running mates can certainly boost a candidate .
but they can also doom them .
dick cheney , the acclaimed choice of george bush in 2000 , is now seen as an increasing liability by moderate republicans .
not because of anything he has done , but because of this image of secretiveness and corporate connections which surrounds him .
a candidate has to be very careful of the company he chooses .
