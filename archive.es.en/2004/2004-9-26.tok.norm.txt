a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?

ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .

dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .

there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "

now the pliable , nutty-flavored cheese with the big wholes , so frequently associated with alpine pastures , could be the next to lose its generic name .
call it " swiss cheese " as milk producers in north america do , and you 're safe .
refer to it by its name of origin , emmental , and you could be in for a new law case , if the federal agriculture office -lrb- fao -rrb- of switzerland has its way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmental by any other name is just cheese with the backing of the swiss dairy farmers , the fao announced plans to give emmental the " protected designation of origin " label , the first step towards safeguarding the cheese from other would-be foreign copies .
it will protect the tradition and quality of the emmental cheese , " jürg jordi , spokesman for the office , told the associated press .
" it will give emmental producers a better position with both local and foreign consumers , providing greater assurance and transparency regarding the production method , quality and origin of the cheese . "
the big cheese germany 's diary industry , backed by emmental producers in france , denmark and austria , challenged the swiss ruling and asked the european commission to intervene , claiming more of the cheese is actually produced outside switzerland than inside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gouda only gouda in holland ?
" the milk association is calling urgently on the commission to take up the question of emmental , " germany 's milk producer 's association said earlier in the week .
the non-swiss producing cheese countries point out that the appellation is not protected under the international agreement of 1951 which gave all cheese producers the right to use the name , and therefore should not be the exclusive right of switzerland .
" also the swiss claim of being the traditional home of emmental does n't count , given that emmental has been produced in germany since 1820 , " the german association said .
what 's in a name ?
the oxford concise english dictionary gives a slightly more pro-swiss definition of the " fromage " in question : " emmental is a kind of hard swiss cheese with holes named after a swiss valley where it was first produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland - home of mountains , alpine pastures and happy cows with bells around their necks .
for the swiss dairy producers , there 's a little more to the name than just location .
under the emmental appellation , cheese makers will be required to use fresh , unpasteurized milk less than 24 hours old , and the cheese will need to mature for a minimum of four months before it can be sold .
the use of additives is prohibited , as is the use of genetically modified ingredients .
the milk must come from grazing cows , and not those raised on feed .
the genuine article is also only produced in local creameries by specialists using traditional recipes .
initially , the new labeling requirement , which is scheduled to go into effect oct .
13 , will only apply to swiss producers .
outside switzerland , producers may still call their cheese emmental , until the eu agrees to recognize the swiss designation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a ham and cheese sandwich by any other name ...

are german architects waking up to the possibilities afforded by globalization ? china currently has a reputation for attracting the biggest names in architecture , and the german proposal for beijing 's new national museum saw stiff competition from illustrious candidates including norman foster and rem koolhaas . set for completion in time for the beijing olympics in 2008 , the project foresees merging the chinese history museum and the chinese revolutionary museum in a new building covering 150,0000 square meters , with 33 exhibition halls .
it 's been billed as a flagship museum showcasing the history and culture of one of the world 's oldest civilizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luchao , harbour , city , china , it 's not the hamburg architect bureau 's only chinese project .
it 's been working in beijing since 1998 .
luchao harbour city -lrb- photo -rrb- , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai , and the museum for city planning under construction in shanghai-pudong , are also gmp designs .
other projects in the pipeline include plans for a university campus , a theater , several office skyscrapers and residential estates . back home in germany , meanwhile , gmp is best-known for designing the new berlin olympic stadium and the revamped lehrter bahnhof train station in berlin . a 10-year head-start on germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert speer it sounds like a success story , but in fact , compared to the us , britain and france , germany has a low profile in china .
the main german bureaus are speer -lrb- photo -rrb- , abb , gmp and fink + jocher . " unfortunately , german architects largely missed the boat when it came to internationalization , " an official for frankfurt-based abb architekten told dbz-online , a web-site for architects . " competition is tough , " said nikolaus götze from gmp in an interview with dbz-online .
" after reunification , german architects had a lot to do and had no reason to look beyond germany 's borders . " " architects from the us , australia , canada and england , who 'd been struggling with years of recession , were obliged to look further afield , " he added .
" so now they have a 10-year head-start on us . " china : a patron of avant-garde architecture the tide is beginning to turn .
in germany , architecture plunged into the doldrums after an initial period of post-unification euphoria .
china , on the other hand , has seen a unique building boom that 's gathered increasing momentum as the 2008 beijing olympics approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's skyline " the chinese government kicked off the 21st century by turning itself into the biggest single patron of avant-garde architecture in the world , " architect christopher hawthorne told the international herald tribune . recently , however , foreign architects working in china have witnessed something of a sea-change in the country 's urban planning policy . the hamburg firm 's recent coup may be part of a trend that 's seen better days .
according to the international herald tribune , the chinese government is slowly reducing its investments in high-profile projects . " there is a debate going on about these big projects , and whether it 's appropriate to be spending so much money on them , and hiring foreign architects instead of chinese , " the paper quotes yan huang , who led the planning for the olympic bid . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building a new reputation abroad despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .

despite missing the olympic gold in athens , the soccer ladies , led by coach tina theune-meyer , have proved they are still a force to be reckoned with on the international pitch .
on saturday they dashed off a 5-0 win against the czech republic and secured top-ranking in the women 's european championship qualification rounds .
the five-time european champions and last year 's world champions are set to defend their title in england next summer .
with eight wins in eight games and an overall goal score of 50:2 , hardly a european team can beat them .
saturday 's match in pribram turned out to be the ideal playing field for theune-meyer to test her new talent .
" it was a good opportunity for the younger players to prove themselves in a real competition .
i think they did a great job , " she said referring to the likes of shelley thomspon , who scored a goal in the 63 minute and britta carlson , who drove one home ten minutes before the whistle blew . dw-world.de germany 's women look to bounce back losing out on olympic gold in athens last month has raised many questions about the german women 's national soccer team .
however , results and history show its not time to push the panic button just yet .

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2004 preparing for afghan elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck gets an overview of the security situation in afghanistan two weeks ahead of afghanistan 's presidential elections , germany 's defense minister paid a visit to kunduz and faizabad , where reconstruction teams are responsible for maintaining security in the unstable region . with afghanistan 's first presidential elections set for october 9 , german troops are actively involved in helping to maintain security in what is still very much an " unstable " country , according to german defense minister peter struck , who arrived in the northern town of faizabad on sunday .
a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .

despite missing the olympic gold in athens , the soccer ladies , led by coach tina theune-meyer , have proved they are still a force to be reckoned with on the international pitch .
on saturday they dashed off a 5-0 win against the czech republic and secured top-ranking in the women 's european championship qualification rounds .
the five-time european champions and last year 's world champions are set to defend their title in england next summer .
with eight wins in eight games and an overall goal score of 50:2 , hardly a european team can beat them .
saturday 's match in pribram turned out to be the ideal playing field for theune-meyer to test her new talent .
" it was a good opportunity for the younger players to prove themselves in a real competition .
i think they did a great job , " she said referring to the likes of shelley thomspon , who scored a goal in the 63 minute and britta carlson , who drove one home ten minutes before the whistle blew . dw-world.de germany 's women look to bounce back losing out on olympic gold in athens last month has raised many questions about the german women 's national soccer team .

are german architects waking up to the possibilities afforded by globalization ? china currently has a reputation for attracting the biggest names in architecture , and the german proposal for beijing 's new national museum saw stiff competition from illustrious candidates including norman foster and rem koolhaas . set for completion in time for the beijing olympics in 2008 , the project foresees merging the chinese history museum and the chinese revolutionary museum in a new building covering 150,0000 square meters , with 33 exhibition halls .

" competition is tough , " said nikolaus götze from gmp in an interview with dbz-online .
" after reunification , german architects had a lot to do and had no reason to look beyond germany 's borders . " " architects from the us , australia , canada and england , who 'd been struggling with years of recession , were obliged to look further afield , " he added .

in germany , architecture plunged into the doldrums after an initial period of post-unification euphoria .

according to the international herald tribune , the chinese government is slowly reducing its investments in high-profile projects . " there is a debate going on about these big projects , and whether it 's appropriate to be spending so much money on them , and hiring foreign architects instead of chinese , " the paper quotes yan huang , who led the planning for the olympic bid . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building a new reputation abroad despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .
starting in 2005 , some 40 more troops will arrive from denmark and the czech republic to increase the effectiveness of the prt .
extension of afghanistan mandate on wednesday , the german government - without a great deal of discussion - voted to extend the afghanistan mandate for one more year .
the current mission , which includes the deployment of troops in kabul and kunduz , would have run out on oct .
13 , just after the election .
starting in 2005 , germany will build another temporary garrison south of the afghanistan capital .
a spokesman for the defense ministry said on saturday an army patrol would travel to the town of surobi , 60 kilometers -lrb- 36 miles -rrb- outside of kabul to discuss the parameters of the new camp with local authorities .
the camp is expected to be up and running prior to next year 's general elections .
with a total of 1,480 soldiers , germany provides the largest national troop contingent within the nato-run international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
election overshadowed by violence the run-up to the presidential election , the first since the taliban regime collapsed in december 2001 , has been overshadowed by a growing number of terrorist attacks throughout the country , as both war-lords and remaining taliban militants vow to disrupt the poll and even kill candidates .
many of the 18 candidates have been hesitant to campaign outside of kabul , for fear of being targeted by the terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai was named afghanistan 's interim president after us forces defeated the taliban in december 2001 .
earlier in the month interim president hamid karzai , who enjoys significant backing from the international community , barely survived an assassination attempt when his helicopter was fired on during a rare trip outside the afghan capital .
" if top government officials are not safe , with all the privileges and facilities they have , how can we , without resources , reach 34 provinces and talk about our ideas for the future , " said sattar sirat , one of the 18 contenders for president , in an interview with reuters .
but the security issue does not only effect the candidates ; the international peacekeepers sent to the outlying provinces are also increasingly at risk .
on saturday , a convoy of coalition and afghan forces , who were monitoring the security situation in the southern province of uruzgan ahead of the elections , were attacked by suspected taliban rebels .
a senior district chief was killed and two afghan soldiers were seriously injured . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans new camp in afghanistan ahead of the next general elections in afghanistan , germany 's army intends to build a military camp south of kabul to boost security at the start of the next year , a defense ministry spokesman said saturday .

now the pliable , nutty-flavored cheese with the big wholes , so frequently associated with alpine pastures , could be the next to lose its generic name .
call it " swiss cheese " as milk producers in north america do , and you 're safe .
refer to it by its name of origin , emmental , and you could be in for a new law case , if the federal agriculture office -lrb- fao -rrb- of switzerland has its way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmental by any other name is just cheese with the backing of the swiss dairy farmers , the fao announced plans to give emmental the " protected designation of origin " label , the first step towards safeguarding the cheese from other would-be foreign copies .
it will protect the tradition and quality of the emmental cheese , " jürg jordi , spokesman for the office , told the associated press .
" it will give emmental producers a better position with both local and foreign consumers , providing greater assurance and transparency regarding the production method , quality and origin of the cheese . "
the big cheese germany 's diary industry , backed by emmental producers in france , denmark and austria , challenged the swiss ruling and asked the european commission to intervene , claiming more of the cheese is actually produced outside switzerland than inside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gouda only gouda in holland ?
" the milk association is calling urgently on the commission to take up the question of emmental , " germany 's milk producer 's association said earlier in the week .
the non-swiss producing cheese countries point out that the appellation is not protected under the international agreement of 1951 which gave all cheese producers the right to use the name , and therefore should not be the exclusive right of switzerland .
" also the swiss claim of being the traditional home of emmental does n't count , given that emmental has been produced in germany since 1820 , " the german association said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2004 no more school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children on their way to school - a rare sight in eastern germany for many a kid , the announcement " school closed " might bring delight .
but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .
starting in 2005 , some 40 more troops will arrive from denmark and the czech republic to increase the effectiveness of the prt .
extension of afghanistan mandate on wednesday , the german government - without a great deal of discussion - voted to extend the afghanistan mandate for one more year .
the current mission , which includes the deployment of troops in kabul and kunduz , would have run out on oct .
13 , just after the election .
starting in 2005 , germany will build another temporary garrison south of the afghanistan capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2004 no more school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children on their way to school - a rare sight in eastern germany for many a kid , the announcement " school closed " might bring delight .
but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on . " volker witting -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .

" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .

more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .

" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "

despite missing the olympic gold in athens , the soccer ladies , led by coach tina theune-meyer , have proved they are still a force to be reckoned with on the international pitch .
on saturday they dashed off a 5-0 win against the czech republic and secured top-ranking in the women 's european championship qualification rounds .
the five-time european champions and last year 's world champions are set to defend their title in england next summer .
with eight wins in eight games and an overall goal score of 50:2 , hardly a european team can beat them .
saturday 's match in pribram turned out to be the ideal playing field for theune-meyer to test her new talent .
" it was a good opportunity for the younger players to prove themselves in a real competition .
i think they did a great job , " she said referring to the likes of shelley thomspon , who scored a goal in the 63 minute and britta carlson , who drove one home ten minutes before the whistle blew . dw-world.de germany 's women look to bounce back losing out on olympic gold in athens last month has raised many questions about the german women 's national soccer team .
however , results and history show its not time to push the panic button just yet .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "

ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .

" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .

despite missing the olympic gold in athens , the soccer ladies , led by coach tina theune-meyer , have proved they are still a force to be reckoned with on the international pitch .
on saturday they dashed off a 5-0 win against the czech republic and secured top-ranking in the women 's european championship qualification rounds .
the five-time european champions and last year 's world champions are set to defend their title in england next summer .
with eight wins in eight games and an overall goal score of 50:2 , hardly a european team can beat them .
saturday 's match in pribram turned out to be the ideal playing field for theune-meyer to test her new talent .
" it was a good opportunity for the younger players to prove themselves in a real competition .
i think they did a great job , " she said referring to the likes of shelley thomspon , who scored a goal in the 63 minute and britta carlson , who drove one home ten minutes before the whistle blew . dw-world.de germany 's women look to bounce back losing out on olympic gold in athens last month has raised many questions about the german women 's national soccer team .
however , results and history show its not time to push the panic button just yet .

now the pliable , nutty-flavored cheese with the big wholes , so frequently associated with alpine pastures , could be the next to lose its generic name .
call it " swiss cheese " as milk producers in north america do , and you 're safe .
refer to it by its name of origin , emmental , and you could be in for a new law case , if the federal agriculture office -lrb- fao -rrb- of switzerland has its way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmental by any other name is just cheese with the backing of the swiss dairy farmers , the fao announced plans to give emmental the " protected designation of origin " label , the first step towards safeguarding the cheese from other would-be foreign copies .
it will protect the tradition and quality of the emmental cheese , " jürg jordi , spokesman for the office , told the associated press .
" it will give emmental producers a better position with both local and foreign consumers , providing greater assurance and transparency regarding the production method , quality and origin of the cheese . "
the big cheese germany 's diary industry , backed by emmental producers in france , denmark and austria , challenged the swiss ruling and asked the european commission to intervene , claiming more of the cheese is actually produced outside switzerland than inside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gouda only gouda in holland ?
" the milk association is calling urgently on the commission to take up the question of emmental , " germany 's milk producer 's association said earlier in the week .
the non-swiss producing cheese countries point out that the appellation is not protected under the international agreement of 1951 which gave all cheese producers the right to use the name , and therefore should not be the exclusive right of switzerland .
" also the swiss claim of being the traditional home of emmental does n't count , given that emmental has been produced in germany since 1820 , " the german association said .
what 's in a name ?
the oxford concise english dictionary gives a slightly more pro-swiss definition of the " fromage " in question : " emmental is a kind of hard swiss cheese with holes named after a swiss valley where it was first produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland - home of mountains , alpine pastures and happy cows with bells around their necks .
for the swiss dairy producers , there 's a little more to the name than just location .
under the emmental appellation , cheese makers will be required to use fresh , unpasteurized milk less than 24 hours old , and the cheese will need to mature for a minimum of four months before it can be sold .
the use of additives is prohibited , as is the use of genetically modified ingredients .
the milk must come from grazing cows , and not those raised on feed .
the genuine article is also only produced in local creameries by specialists using traditional recipes .
initially , the new labeling requirement , which is scheduled to go into effect oct .
13 , will only apply to swiss producers .
outside switzerland , producers may still call their cheese emmental , until the eu agrees to recognize the swiss designation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a ham and cheese sandwich by any other name ...

are german architects waking up to the possibilities afforded by globalization ? china currently has a reputation for attracting the biggest names in architecture , and the german proposal for beijing 's new national museum saw stiff competition from illustrious candidates including norman foster and rem koolhaas . set for completion in time for the beijing olympics in 2008 , the project foresees merging the chinese history museum and the chinese revolutionary museum in a new building covering 150,0000 square meters , with 33 exhibition halls .
it 's been billed as a flagship museum showcasing the history and culture of one of the world 's oldest civilizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luchao , harbour , city , china , it 's not the hamburg architect bureau 's only chinese project .

" competition is tough , " said nikolaus götze from gmp in an interview with dbz-online .
" after reunification , german architects had a lot to do and had no reason to look beyond germany 's borders . " " architects from the us , australia , canada and england , who 'd been struggling with years of recession , were obliged to look further afield , " he added .
" so now they have a 10-year head-start on us . " china : a patron of avant-garde architecture the tide is beginning to turn .
in germany , architecture plunged into the doldrums after an initial period of post-unification euphoria .
china , on the other hand , has seen a unique building boom that 's gathered increasing momentum as the 2008 beijing olympics approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's skyline " the chinese government kicked off the 21st century by turning itself into the biggest single patron of avant-garde architecture in the world , " architect christopher hawthorne told the international herald tribune . recently , however , foreign architects working in china have witnessed something of a sea-change in the country 's urban planning policy . the hamburg firm 's recent coup may be part of a trend that 's seen better days .
according to the international herald tribune , the chinese government is slowly reducing its investments in high-profile projects . " there is a debate going on about these big projects , and whether it 's appropriate to be spending so much money on them , and hiring foreign architects instead of chinese , " the paper quotes yan huang , who led the planning for the olympic bid . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building a new reputation abroad despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc german women score big whereas the men 's national team failed to get past the group rounds in the summer 's european championship in portugal , germany 's women are assured of much bigger successes next year .
despite missing the olympic gold in athens , the soccer ladies , led by coach tina theune-meyer , have proved they are still a force to be reckoned with on the international pitch .
on saturday they dashed off a 5-0 win against the czech republic and secured top-ranking in the women 's european championship qualification rounds .
the five-time european champions and last year 's world champions are set to defend their title in england next summer .
with eight wins in eight games and an overall goal score of 50:2 , hardly a european team can beat them .
saturday 's match in pribram turned out to be the ideal playing field for theune-meyer to test her new talent .
" it was a good opportunity for the younger players to prove themselves in a real competition .
i think they did a great job , " she said referring to the likes of shelley thomspon , who scored a goal in the 63 minute and britta carlson , who drove one home ten minutes before the whistle blew . dw-world.de germany 's women look to bounce back losing out on olympic gold in athens last month has raised many questions about the german women 's national soccer team .
however , results and history show its not time to push the panic button just yet .

despite missing the olympic gold in athens , the soccer ladies , led by coach tina theune-meyer , have proved they are still a force to be reckoned with on the international pitch .
on saturday they dashed off a 5-0 win against the czech republic and secured top-ranking in the women 's european championship qualification rounds .
the five-time european champions and last year 's world champions are set to defend their title in england next summer .
with eight wins in eight games and an overall goal score of 50:2 , hardly a european team can beat them .
saturday 's match in pribram turned out to be the ideal playing field for theune-meyer to test her new talent .
" it was a good opportunity for the younger players to prove themselves in a real competition .
i think they did a great job , " she said referring to the likes of shelley thomspon , who scored a goal in the 63 minute and britta carlson , who drove one home ten minutes before the whistle blew . dw-world.de germany 's women look to bounce back losing out on olympic gold in athens last month has raised many questions about the german women 's national soccer team .
however , results and history show its not time to push the panic button just yet .

now the pliable , nutty-flavored cheese with the big wholes , so frequently associated with alpine pastures , could be the next to lose its generic name .
call it " swiss cheese " as milk producers in north america do , and you 're safe .
refer to it by its name of origin , emmental , and you could be in for a new law case , if the federal agriculture office -lrb- fao -rrb- of switzerland has its way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmental by any other name is just cheese with the backing of the swiss dairy farmers , the fao announced plans to give emmental the " protected designation of origin " label , the first step towards safeguarding the cheese from other would-be foreign copies .
it will protect the tradition and quality of the emmental cheese , " jürg jordi , spokesman for the office , told the associated press .
" it will give emmental producers a better position with both local and foreign consumers , providing greater assurance and transparency regarding the production method , quality and origin of the cheese . "
the big cheese germany 's diary industry , backed by emmental producers in france , denmark and austria , challenged the swiss ruling and asked the european commission to intervene , claiming more of the cheese is actually produced outside switzerland than inside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gouda only gouda in holland ?
" the milk association is calling urgently on the commission to take up the question of emmental , " germany 's milk producer 's association said earlier in the week .
the non-swiss producing cheese countries point out that the appellation is not protected under the international agreement of 1951 which gave all cheese producers the right to use the name , and therefore should not be the exclusive right of switzerland .
" also the swiss claim of being the traditional home of emmental does n't count , given that emmental has been produced in germany since 1820 , " the german association said .
what 's in a name ?
the oxford concise english dictionary gives a slightly more pro-swiss definition of the " fromage " in question : " emmental is a kind of hard swiss cheese with holes named after a swiss valley where it was first produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland - home of mountains , alpine pastures and happy cows with bells around their necks .
for the swiss dairy producers , there 's a little more to the name than just location .
under the emmental appellation , cheese makers will be required to use fresh , unpasteurized milk less than 24 hours old , and the cheese will need to mature for a minimum of four months before it can be sold .
the use of additives is prohibited , as is the use of genetically modified ingredients .
the milk must come from grazing cows , and not those raised on feed .
the genuine article is also only produced in local creameries by specialists using traditional recipes .
initially , the new labeling requirement , which is scheduled to go into effect oct .
13 , will only apply to swiss producers .
outside switzerland , producers may still call their cheese emmental , until the eu agrees to recognize the swiss designation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a ham and cheese sandwich by any other name ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2004 no more school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children on their way to school - a rare sight in eastern germany for many a kid , the announcement " school closed " might bring delight .
but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .
starting in 2005 , some 40 more troops will arrive from denmark and the czech republic to increase the effectiveness of the prt .
extension of afghanistan mandate on wednesday , the german government - without a great deal of discussion - voted to extend the afghanistan mandate for one more year .
the current mission , which includes the deployment of troops in kabul and kunduz , would have run out on oct .
13 , just after the election .
starting in 2005 , germany will build another temporary garrison south of the afghanistan capital .
a spokesman for the defense ministry said on saturday an army patrol would travel to the town of surobi , 60 kilometers -lrb- 36 miles -rrb- outside of kabul to discuss the parameters of the new camp with local authorities .
the camp is expected to be up and running prior to next year 's general elections .
with a total of 1,480 soldiers , germany provides the largest national troop contingent within the nato-run international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
election overshadowed by violence the run-up to the presidential election , the first since the taliban regime collapsed in december 2001 , has been overshadowed by a growing number of terrorist attacks throughout the country , as both war-lords and remaining taliban militants vow to disrupt the poll and even kill candidates .
many of the 18 candidates have been hesitant to campaign outside of kabul , for fear of being targeted by the terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai was named afghanistan 's interim president after us forces defeated the taliban in december 2001 .
earlier in the month interim president hamid karzai , who enjoys significant backing from the international community , barely survived an assassination attempt when his helicopter was fired on during a rare trip outside the afghan capital .
" if top government officials are not safe , with all the privileges and facilities they have , how can we , without resources , reach 34 provinces and talk about our ideas for the future , " said sattar sirat , one of the 18 contenders for president , in an interview with reuters .
but the security issue does not only effect the candidates ; the international peacekeepers sent to the outlying provinces are also increasingly at risk .
on saturday , a convoy of coalition and afghan forces , who were monitoring the security situation in the southern province of uruzgan ahead of the elections , were attacked by suspected taliban rebels .
a senior district chief was killed and two afghan soldiers were seriously injured . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans new camp in afghanistan ahead of the next general elections in afghanistan , germany 's army intends to build a military camp south of kabul to boost security at the start of the next year , a defense ministry spokesman said saturday .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .

" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .

" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .
starting in 2005 , some 40 more troops will arrive from denmark and the czech republic to increase the effectiveness of the prt .
extension of afghanistan mandate on wednesday , the german government - without a great deal of discussion - voted to extend the afghanistan mandate for one more year .
the current mission , which includes the deployment of troops in kabul and kunduz , would have run out on oct .
13 , just after the election .
starting in 2005 , germany will build another temporary garrison south of the afghanistan capital .
a spokesman for the defense ministry said on saturday an army patrol would travel to the town of surobi , 60 kilometers -lrb- 36 miles -rrb- outside of kabul to discuss the parameters of the new camp with local authorities .
the camp is expected to be up and running prior to next year 's general elections .
with a total of 1,480 soldiers , germany provides the largest national troop contingent within the nato-run international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
election overshadowed by violence the run-up to the presidential election , the first since the taliban regime collapsed in december 2001 , has been overshadowed by a growing number of terrorist attacks throughout the country , as both war-lords and remaining taliban militants vow to disrupt the poll and even kill candidates .
many of the 18 candidates have been hesitant to campaign outside of kabul , for fear of being targeted by the terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai was named afghanistan 's interim president after us forces defeated the taliban in december 2001 .
earlier in the month interim president hamid karzai , who enjoys significant backing from the international community , barely survived an assassination attempt when his helicopter was fired on during a rare trip outside the afghan capital .
" if top government officials are not safe , with all the privileges and facilities they have , how can we , without resources , reach 34 provinces and talk about our ideas for the future , " said sattar sirat , one of the 18 contenders for president , in an interview with reuters .
but the security issue does not only effect the candidates ; the international peacekeepers sent to the outlying provinces are also increasingly at risk .
on saturday , a convoy of coalition and afghan forces , who were monitoring the security situation in the southern province of uruzgan ahead of the elections , were attacked by suspected taliban rebels .

it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .

with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .

that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .

there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .

" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .

" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .

now the pliable , nutty-flavored cheese with the big wholes , so frequently associated with alpine pastures , could be the next to lose its generic name .
call it " swiss cheese " as milk producers in north america do , and you 're safe .
refer to it by its name of origin , emmental , and you could be in for a new law case , if the federal agriculture office -lrb- fao -rrb- of switzerland has its way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmental by any other name is just cheese with the backing of the swiss dairy farmers , the fao announced plans to give emmental the " protected designation of origin " label , the first step towards safeguarding the cheese from other would-be foreign copies .
it will protect the tradition and quality of the emmental cheese , " jürg jordi , spokesman for the office , told the associated press .
" it will give emmental producers a better position with both local and foreign consumers , providing greater assurance and transparency regarding the production method , quality and origin of the cheese . "
the big cheese germany 's diary industry , backed by emmental producers in france , denmark and austria , challenged the swiss ruling and asked the european commission to intervene , claiming more of the cheese is actually produced outside switzerland than inside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gouda only gouda in holland ?
" the milk association is calling urgently on the commission to take up the question of emmental , " germany 's milk producer 's association said earlier in the week .
the non-swiss producing cheese countries point out that the appellation is not protected under the international agreement of 1951 which gave all cheese producers the right to use the name , and therefore should not be the exclusive right of switzerland .
" also the swiss claim of being the traditional home of emmental does n't count , given that emmental has been produced in germany since 1820 , " the german association said .
what 's in a name ?
the oxford concise english dictionary gives a slightly more pro-swiss definition of the " fromage " in question : " emmental is a kind of hard swiss cheese with holes named after a swiss valley where it was first produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland - home of mountains , alpine pastures and happy cows with bells around their necks .
for the swiss dairy producers , there 's a little more to the name than just location .
under the emmental appellation , cheese makers will be required to use fresh , unpasteurized milk less than 24 hours old , and the cheese will need to mature for a minimum of four months before it can be sold .
the use of additives is prohibited , as is the use of genetically modified ingredients .
the milk must come from grazing cows , and not those raised on feed .
the genuine article is also only produced in local creameries by specialists using traditional recipes .
initially , the new labeling requirement , which is scheduled to go into effect oct .
13 , will only apply to swiss producers .
outside switzerland , producers may still call their cheese emmental , until the eu agrees to recognize the swiss designation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a ham and cheese sandwich by any other name ...

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .
starting in 2005 , some 40 more troops will arrive from denmark and the czech republic to increase the effectiveness of the prt .
extension of afghanistan mandate on wednesday , the german government - without a great deal of discussion - voted to extend the afghanistan mandate for one more year .
the current mission , which includes the deployment of troops in kabul and kunduz , would have run out on oct .
13 , just after the election .
starting in 2005 , germany will build another temporary garrison south of the afghanistan capital .
a spokesman for the defense ministry said on saturday an army patrol would travel to the town of surobi , 60 kilometers -lrb- 36 miles -rrb- outside of kabul to discuss the parameters of the new camp with local authorities .
the camp is expected to be up and running prior to next year 's general elections .
with a total of 1,480 soldiers , germany provides the largest national troop contingent within the nato-run international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
election overshadowed by violence the run-up to the presidential election , the first since the taliban regime collapsed in december 2001 , has been overshadowed by a growing number of terrorist attacks throughout the country , as both war-lords and remaining taliban militants vow to disrupt the poll and even kill candidates .
many of the 18 candidates have been hesitant to campaign outside of kabul , for fear of being targeted by the terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai was named afghanistan 's interim president after us forces defeated the taliban in december 2001 .
earlier in the month interim president hamid karzai , who enjoys significant backing from the international community , barely survived an assassination attempt when his helicopter was fired on during a rare trip outside the afghan capital .
" if top government officials are not safe , with all the privileges and facilities they have , how can we , without resources , reach 34 provinces and talk about our ideas for the future , " said sattar sirat , one of the 18 contenders for president , in an interview with reuters .
but the security issue does not only effect the candidates ; the international peacekeepers sent to the outlying provinces are also increasingly at risk .
on saturday , a convoy of coalition and afghan forces , who were monitoring the security situation in the southern province of uruzgan ahead of the elections , were attacked by suspected taliban rebels .
a senior district chief was killed and two afghan soldiers were seriously injured . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans new camp in afghanistan ahead of the next general elections in afghanistan , germany 's army intends to build a military camp south of kabul to boost security at the start of the next year , a defense ministry spokesman said saturday .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .

no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "

ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .

non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .

are german architects waking up to the possibilities afforded by globalization ? china currently has a reputation for attracting the biggest names in architecture , and the german proposal for beijing 's new national museum saw stiff competition from illustrious candidates including norman foster and rem koolhaas . set for completion in time for the beijing olympics in 2008 , the project foresees merging the chinese history museum and the chinese revolutionary museum in a new building covering 150,0000 square meters , with 33 exhibition halls .
it 's been billed as a flagship museum showcasing the history and culture of one of the world 's oldest civilizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luchao , harbour , city , china , it 's not the hamburg architect bureau 's only chinese project .
it 's been working in beijing since 1998 .
luchao harbour city -lrb- photo -rrb- , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai , and the museum for city planning under construction in shanghai-pudong , are also gmp designs .
other projects in the pipeline include plans for a university campus , a theater , several office skyscrapers and residential estates . back home in germany , meanwhile , gmp is best-known for designing the new berlin olympic stadium and the revamped lehrter bahnhof train station in berlin . a 10-year head-start on germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert speer it sounds like a success story , but in fact , compared to the us , britain and france , germany has a low profile in china .
the main german bureaus are speer -lrb- photo -rrb- , abb , gmp and fink + jocher . " unfortunately , german architects largely missed the boat when it came to internationalization , " an official for frankfurt-based abb architekten told dbz-online , a web-site for architects . " competition is tough , " said nikolaus götze from gmp in an interview with dbz-online .
" after reunification , german architects had a lot to do and had no reason to look beyond germany 's borders . " " architects from the us , australia , canada and england , who 'd been struggling with years of recession , were obliged to look further afield , " he added .
" so now they have a 10-year head-start on us . " china : a patron of avant-garde architecture the tide is beginning to turn .
in germany , architecture plunged into the doldrums after an initial period of post-unification euphoria .
china , on the other hand , has seen a unique building boom that 's gathered increasing momentum as the 2008 beijing olympics approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's skyline " the chinese government kicked off the 21st century by turning itself into the biggest single patron of avant-garde architecture in the world , " architect christopher hawthorne told the international herald tribune . recently , however , foreign architects working in china have witnessed something of a sea-change in the country 's urban planning policy . the hamburg firm 's recent coup may be part of a trend that 's seen better days .
according to the international herald tribune , the chinese government is slowly reducing its investments in high-profile projects . " there is a debate going on about these big projects , and whether it 's appropriate to be spending so much money on them , and hiring foreign architects instead of chinese , " the paper quotes yan huang , who led the planning for the olympic bid . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building a new reputation abroad despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .

ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2004 german literature gets bad rap abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german book stores are full of foreign titles while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad . while foreign books enjoy a good reputation in germany , the same can not be said of german literature abroad .
a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .
whether that forecast will translate into action remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world literature around the clock berlin is sounding a lot like the tower of babel as the 2nd international literature festival gets underway with more than 100 authors from over 50 countries transforming the german capital into a literary hub .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .

a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .

now the pliable , nutty-flavored cheese with the big wholes , so frequently associated with alpine pastures , could be the next to lose its generic name .
call it " swiss cheese " as milk producers in north america do , and you 're safe .
refer to it by its name of origin , emmental , and you could be in for a new law case , if the federal agriculture office -lrb- fao -rrb- of switzerland has its way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmental by any other name is just cheese with the backing of the swiss dairy farmers , the fao announced plans to give emmental the " protected designation of origin " label , the first step towards safeguarding the cheese from other would-be foreign copies .
it will protect the tradition and quality of the emmental cheese , " jürg jordi , spokesman for the office , told the associated press .
" it will give emmental producers a better position with both local and foreign consumers , providing greater assurance and transparency regarding the production method , quality and origin of the cheese . "
the big cheese germany 's diary industry , backed by emmental producers in france , denmark and austria , challenged the swiss ruling and asked the european commission to intervene , claiming more of the cheese is actually produced outside switzerland than inside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gouda only gouda in holland ?
" the milk association is calling urgently on the commission to take up the question of emmental , " germany 's milk producer 's association said earlier in the week .
the non-swiss producing cheese countries point out that the appellation is not protected under the international agreement of 1951 which gave all cheese producers the right to use the name , and therefore should not be the exclusive right of switzerland .
" also the swiss claim of being the traditional home of emmental does n't count , given that emmental has been produced in germany since 1820 , " the german association said .
what 's in a name ?
the oxford concise english dictionary gives a slightly more pro-swiss definition of the " fromage " in question : " emmental is a kind of hard swiss cheese with holes named after a swiss valley where it was first produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland - home of mountains , alpine pastures and happy cows with bells around their necks .
for the swiss dairy producers , there 's a little more to the name than just location .
under the emmental appellation , cheese makers will be required to use fresh , unpasteurized milk less than 24 hours old , and the cheese will need to mature for a minimum of four months before it can be sold .
the use of additives is prohibited , as is the use of genetically modified ingredients .
the milk must come from grazing cows , and not those raised on feed .
the genuine article is also only produced in local creameries by specialists using traditional recipes .
initially , the new labeling requirement , which is scheduled to go into effect oct .
13 , will only apply to swiss producers .
outside switzerland , producers may still call their cheese emmental , until the eu agrees to recognize the swiss designation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a ham and cheese sandwich by any other name ...

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .

the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .

that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .

there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "

a one-day visit to the headquarters of the german provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , was intended to give the head of the country 's armed forces an overview of the situation in the run-up to the historical poll .
although fighting continues in pockets of afghanistan , especially in the rural provinces outside kabul , where the taliban continues to hold sway and local war-lords battle it out for influence , struck was of the opinion that there was no real serious threat to the 110 german troops stationed in faizabad .
minister defends troops at the same time , struck defended the actions of the bundeswehr soldiers during an encounter at the beginning of september , shortly after the prt took up post in faizabad .
the german troops had been accused of failing to defend civilian aid workers who were attacked by an armed and angry crowd .
back in germany , they were criticized for not doing enough to protect the civilian population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck and the commander of the bundeswehr in kunduz , colonel reinhard burz , visit troops in faizabad struck stressed that the soldiers had reacted appropriately .
unless specifically requested by the local afghan police or in the case of self-defense , the bundeswehr is prohibited from intervening in armed clashes , he said .
with a view to the upcoming elections and the likelihood of escalated violence , the minister ordered more protection for the german soldiers .
from now on they will be equipped with tear gas , shields and riot gear , he stated .
starting in 2005 , some 40 more troops will arrive from denmark and the czech republic to increase the effectiveness of the prt .
extension of afghanistan mandate on wednesday , the german government - without a great deal of discussion - voted to extend the afghanistan mandate for one more year .
the current mission , which includes the deployment of troops in kabul and kunduz , would have run out on oct .
13 , just after the election .
starting in 2005 , germany will build another temporary garrison south of the afghanistan capital .
a spokesman for the defense ministry said on saturday an army patrol would travel to the town of surobi , 60 kilometers -lrb- 36 miles -rrb- outside of kabul to discuss the parameters of the new camp with local authorities .
the camp is expected to be up and running prior to next year 's general elections .
with a total of 1,480 soldiers , germany provides the largest national troop contingent within the nato-run international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
election overshadowed by violence the run-up to the presidential election , the first since the taliban regime collapsed in december 2001 , has been overshadowed by a growing number of terrorist attacks throughout the country , as both war-lords and remaining taliban militants vow to disrupt the poll and even kill candidates .
many of the 18 candidates have been hesitant to campaign outside of kabul , for fear of being targeted by the terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai was named afghanistan 's interim president after us forces defeated the taliban in december 2001 .
earlier in the month interim president hamid karzai , who enjoys significant backing from the international community , barely survived an assassination attempt when his helicopter was fired on during a rare trip outside the afghan capital .
" if top government officials are not safe , with all the privileges and facilities they have , how can we , without resources , reach 34 provinces and talk about our ideas for the future , " said sattar sirat , one of the 18 contenders for president , in an interview with reuters .
but the security issue does not only effect the candidates ; the international peacekeepers sent to the outlying provinces are also increasingly at risk .
on saturday , a convoy of coalition and afghan forces , who were monitoring the security situation in the southern province of uruzgan ahead of the elections , were attacked by suspected taliban rebels .
a senior district chief was killed and two afghan soldiers were seriously injured . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans new camp in afghanistan ahead of the next general elections in afghanistan , germany 's army intends to build a military camp south of kabul to boost security at the start of the next year , a defense ministry spokesman said saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2004 no more school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children on their way to school - a rare sight in eastern germany for many a kid , the announcement " school closed " might bring delight .
but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .
only the older residents remain .
there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .
" i think the countryside is pretty and i would like to be able to stay here , " she said .
" but the way things look now , i ca n't really see any future .
school is a problem , as well as vocational training and my career and so on .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacant houses are a frequent sight in eastern germany around 20 percent of the working population in pretzsch is unemployed .
one by one , shops shut down , and people who have the chance leave .

there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .
" it 's a responsible move , " said jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister for the state .
" we have a changing population structure in the eastern states .
in the future we 're going to have half the number of schoolchildren , therefore we ca n't continue to run the same number of schools we have now . "
for anne and her family , the situation will only get worse .

but in eastern germany , where it 's become a reality , the closing of schools is yet another symbol of the region 's economic woes . the school day begins early for anne zielasko .
it 's 5:30 in the morning and time for her to get ready to leave home .
she has to wake up earlier this year because the school she used to attend in a neighboring town has closed .
" it 's exhausting .
i 'm tired on the bus and have to make sure i do n't fall asleep at school .
i do n't get home until around 4:00 in the afternoon after getting up at 5:00 .
it 's really tiring , " she said .
anne leaves home every day shortly after 6:30 .
it takes her 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop .
the school she used to go to in the town of pretzsch was only eight kilometers -lrb- 4.8 miles -rrb- away .
now she has to travel 38 kilometers to wittenberg .
the trip takes almost an hour and a half .
anne says she likes her new school , if only the journey to get there were shorter .
the long commute to school is the product of changing economic circumstances in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
as in other parts of the economically depressed east , when unemployment rises , people leave in search of jobs in the more affluent parts of the country .
they leave behind vacant houses and unpopulated neighborhoods .
when the families go , the schools empty out and eventually close down for lack of pupils .
anne 's mother has gone to a lawyer to try to change the situation .
" i know it 's wishful thinking , but my dream is for the school to be reopened .
that 's what i want .
but i do n't think it 's possible , " she said .
vacant schools anne used to attend the heide high school in pretzsch .
with the support of the town 's mayor , parents fought to have the school re-opened .
they even proposed setting up a private school .
but school authorities and state educators rebuffed the idea .
they said there were simply too few pupils to make it worth the money it would cost to keep the building in operation .

there are hardly any families with young children left , and no one new is moving in .
" we have an industrial estate here in pretzsch that 's conveniently situated along a main road .
every year i get two or three inquiries from companies interested in setting up business here , " said karlheinz horn , mayor of pretzsch .
" but as soon as i say there are no schools , the companies are no longer interested .
they do n't come back . "
more school closures ahead but pretzsch is n't the only town affected .
in the past 10 years , almost one-third of the schools in saxony-anhalt have been shut down as the number of children declines .
state education officials have said they plan to close down even more in the coming year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2004 german literature gets bad rap abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german book stores are full of foreign titles while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad . while foreign books enjoy a good reputation in germany , the same can not be said of german literature abroad .
a recent study on translation and publishing licenses compiled by the association of german publishers and booksellers shows that on the whole contemporary german fiction is not fairing too well outside the country .
the ratio of imported and exported books is 3 to 1 , meaning fewer foreign audiences read german authors than vice versa .
however , as experts point out , the german book trade has experienced major changes in the last several years .
emerging asia market since 1998 , china has been consecutively among the biggest markets for german publishing licenses .
in 2003 , the country purchased 660 licenses for literary works , considerably more than any other country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese market is the largest for german translations .
dr. singh bartz , director of the german book information center in beijing , attributes the growing interest in german literature to scholars who returned back home from their studies in germany and worked as editors .
as in south korea , which acquired 616 publishing licenses in 2002 and has seen an increase in the number of academics studying in germany , there is a direct correlation between an audience 's foreign language skills and interest in a publishing that country 's literature .
no fancy for fiction although many of the editors in asia may have studied in germany , there is little interest in high-brow contemporary fiction .
non-fiction translations of philosophy , psychology and science works were more popular than the new works by hard-hitting authors like christa wolf or martin walser .
even more successful , though , are books for children and juveniles , for which china bought 178 translation licenses .
" the close collaboration between chinese and german publishers during the printing process and the merchandizing of related products have contributed hugely to the success of german children and juvenile books in china , " explained batz .
moreover , he said " german children and juvenile literature is considered entertaining , inspiring and fits well with the chinese illustrative and educational approach , as opposed to contemporary literature which still suffers under the reputation of being too dry and analytical . "
too boring ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the earth 's biggest bookstore " is in seattle , where amazon.com has its warehouse .
that reputation applies to other foreign markets as well .
in the united sates , which together with the rest of the english-speaking publishing world accounts for only a small segment of german foreign licensing - in 2004 english ranked sixth behind polish , spanish and czech markets for purchase of translation rights - works of contemporary german authors have a difficult time finding fans .
ricky stock , head of the german book office in new york , a non-profit organization that serves as a bridge between the german and american publishing industries , confirmed that there is hardly any demand for german fiction in the us .
" the american market is immensely competitive and american editors are hard to convince of giving german contemporary authors a chance , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize winner günter grass in germany 's best known contemporary fiction writer .
dr. anne-bitt gericke , head of litrix.de , an online translation service , agreed .
" we are trying our best to get us-americans interested in german literature .
the us market definitely sets the tone and is therefore an important one .
americans are still conspicuously reserved towards german fiction , often considering it too profound and too german-orientated , " she said .
language barrier when it comes to the procurement of license contracts , however , reputation is not the biggest stumbling block .
more often than not , it 's the lack of language familiarity .
" a huge problem is that most of the american editors do n't speak german and rely on sample translations which have to be provided first , " stock explained , while adding that funding for translations is often hard to find .
organizations such as the german book office in new york and litrix.de , which works in association with the goethe institute , focus on promoting and disseminating german literature abroad , especially fiction , by funding translation projects .
" we organize various book readings , meetings with foreign publishers , fund translation programs and work closely with the frankfurt book fair , " said clemens peter haase , director for literature and translation at the geothe institute , one of the country 's largest government funded cultural organizations . # b # despite the low level of acceptance in one of the world 's largest publishing markets , german contemporary authors should not despair : " next year , german titles will experience an unprecedented boost in the us , " promised stock .
whether that forecast will translate into action remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : world literature around the clock berlin is sounding a lot like the tower of babel as the 2nd international literature festival gets underway with more than 100 authors from over 50 countries transforming the german capital into a literary hub .

at the party 's official campaign launch in brisbane , the prime minister , john howard , said australia stood " proud and tall " because of its economic achievements and its willingness to fight extremism .
mr howard , a key ally of the us in iraq , is seeking a fourth consecutive term in office when australians go to the polls on 9 october .
there were noisy demonstrations in brisbane by groups opposed to the government 's involvement in iraq .
several hundred protesters gathered to vent their frustrations at australia 's military role in the gulf , chanting " howard out , end the lies " .
the issue has become an important part of the election campaign .

the main opposition , however , has promised to bring most of them home by the end of the year if it wins power .

it will be a long fight and a difficult fight and we must do it in co-operation with our friends all around the world , and most particularly here in our region .
john howard " terrorism has cast a dark cloud over the world but it is a challenge that must be repulsed and a challenge best repulsed by us being determined to live the lives of a free and democratic society . "
mr howard , who has been in office since 1996 , said australians could trust his government to confront the peril of international terrorism .
he went on to say that the decision to commit troops to the invasion of iraq was the most difficult he had ever made but he insisted it was the right one .
australia has suffered no combat casualties in the gulf .
the leader of the opposition , mark latham , will outline his vision for the future when the labour party officially launches its campaign on wednesday .
