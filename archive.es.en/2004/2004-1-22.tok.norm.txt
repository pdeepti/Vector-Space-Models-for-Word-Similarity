germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .

-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- there are an estimated 350 million pages of documents surviving from the baathist regime .
about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .
" an archive like this , down the line , will change the way iraqis think of themselves in an infinitely better way , " said makiya . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .

-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- there are an estimated 350 million pages of documents surviving from the baathist regime .
about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .

a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .
both sides have the option to appeal to the court ’ s grand chamber , which includes 17 judges .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .
juli 2003 , in berlin .
die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , gab heute auf einer pressekonferenz bekannt , dass die so genannten " rosenholz " -daten der bundesrepublik von den usa an deutschland uebergeben wurden .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- there are an estimated 350 million pages of documents surviving from the baathist regime .
about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .
" an archive like this , down the line , will change the way iraqis think of themselves in an infinitely better way , " said makiya . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .
both sides have the option to appeal to the court ’ s grand chamber , which includes 17 judges .
germany 's constitutional court had ruled in favor of the dispossession in 2000 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin library caught up in controversial legal battle controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .

but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .
both sides have the option to appeal to the court ’ s grand chamber , which includes 17 judges .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .
both sides have the option to appeal to the court ’ s grand chamber , which includes 17 judges .
germany 's constitutional court had ruled in favor of the dispossession in 2000 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin library caught up in controversial legal battle controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .
esser ’ s testimony was interrupted when court was adjourned . the trial resumes next wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top banker faces court in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .

there 's a possibility that the proceedings will take place in germany where the charge of " disturbing the peace of the dead " could be called upon . dw-world.de german accused of using bodies of executed in exhibits a professor who preserves human bodies for display in exhibitions allegedly used remains of people executed in china .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .
september 2003 , den sechsten taetigkeitsbericht ihrer behoerde .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .
esser ’ s testimony was interrupted when court was adjourned . the trial resumes next wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top banker faces court in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .

about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .
esser ’ s testimony was interrupted when court was adjourned . the trial resumes next wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top banker faces court in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .
both sides have the option to appeal to the court ’ s grand chamber , which includes 17 judges .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .
deutsche bank shares were seemingly unaffected by the proceedings , performing in line with other major european banks . mannesmann ’ s former chief executive , klaus esser -lrb- photo -rrb- , also gave testimony on thursday . he is accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser. of abetting breach of trust by accepting around € 30 million after the record € 180 billion takeover . he said that the deal was a great victory for mannesmann ’ s shareholders , but a defeat for its management board and executives .

the germans hoped to show that mental glimpses of insight are reorganized into new , conscious knowledge .
the researchers gave 66 students a memory task which taught two simple rules to help them convert a string of eight digits into a new order in seven steps .
however , there was a secret third way which would come to the right answer almost immediately .
allowing half to sleep and keeping the other half awake , the researchers found that 60 percent of those who slept discovered the secret rule , compared to 22 percent among those who stayed awake . more briefs 22.01.2004 -pipe- case of russian corpses back to haunt von hagens 22.01.2004 -pipe- no tax equality for married homosexuals 21.01.2004 -pipe- no sex ed .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide . josef ackermann , one of germany ’ s top bankers , smiled at tv crews and reporters as he entered the regional criminal court in düsseldorf on thursday and appeared nonplussed under the prosecution 's magnifying glass . “ i don ’ t know where there is supposed to be a legal problem , ” he said during his 40 minutes of testimony . the legal problem , according to the prosecution , is that ackermann wasted shareholders ’ money when he awarded multi-million euro bonuses to five former mannesmann executives – also on trial - following the sale in 2000 of the german mobile phone company to the british giant , vodafone . all six defendants face fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years if found guilty . no walk in the park “ according to business law i have acted correctly , ” ackermann said . the deutsche bank chief approved bonuses of around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- to the mannesmann executives , who he said got the extraordinary reward for the job they did during the months-long takeover battle . as defendant and former mannesmann supervisory board head joachim funk put it , “ a hostile takeover is hardly a walk in the park . ” such large executive bonuses are uncommon in germany , where executive pay is well below the salaries and bonuses paid to top managers in the united states or britain . the trial is being closely followed by the german business community , as a guilty verdict could force directors to act more cautiously when awarding bonuses . intimidation attempt ackermann and the five other defendants argue that the trial is an attempt to intimidate those who would encourage risk-taking in germany ’ s traditionally conservative business climate , and could have the adverse effect of discouraging top talent from other countries from wanting to work here . ackermann received support from another of germany ’ s business elite , siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer . “ it can ’ t be right that companies ’ decision-making … is impaired because the offense of breach of trust hangs over them like a sword of damocles , ” von pierer said . deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann ever since charges were filed against him , though the swiss-born banker will almost certainly have to resign should he be found guilty .

the germans hoped to show that mental glimpses of insight are reorganized into new , conscious knowledge .
the researchers gave 66 students a memory task which taught two simple rules to help them convert a string of eight digits into a new order in seven steps .
however , there was a secret third way which would come to the right answer almost immediately .
allowing half to sleep and keeping the other half awake , the researchers found that 60 percent of those who slept discovered the secret rule , compared to 22 percent among those who stayed awake . more briefs 22.01.2004 -pipe- case of russian corpses back to haunt von hagens 22.01.2004 -pipe- no tax equality for married homosexuals 21.01.2004 -pipe- no sex ed .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .

it would be the eu ’ s third peacekeeping mission after operations in the democratic republic of congo and in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
there has been some debate about exactly when the eu will be ready to safeguard the fragile peace , which has followed years of inter-ethnic warfare in the early 1990s .
" it is a bit difficult to give an exact date .
of course a lot of military planning is necessary .
you ca n't do this overnight , " said the new nato chief , jaap de hoop scheffer .
the eu ’ s head of foreign policy , javier solana , said he was convinced the union is ready for the operation .
the u.s. has continuously voiced its concern about the eu ’ s ability to successfully take over from nato ’ s sfor force .
the eu currently has a police mission in the country and would be expected to provide around 6,000 personnel for the peacekeeping force .
nato ’ s current forces in the country stand at double that figure but will be reduced to 7,000 by june 2004 .
final decisions on the date for the eu takeover are likely to come at a key nato meeting in istanbul in june .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .

about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .

the germans hoped to show that mental glimpses of insight are reorganized into new , conscious knowledge .
the researchers gave 66 students a memory task which taught two simple rules to help them convert a string of eight digits into a new order in seven steps .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .

about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .

" we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .
juli 2003 , in berlin .
die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , gab heute auf einer pressekonferenz bekannt , dass die so genannten " rosenholz " -daten der bundesrepublik von den usa an deutschland uebergeben wurden .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- there are an estimated 350 million pages of documents surviving from the baathist regime .
about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .
" an archive like this , down the line , will change the way iraqis think of themselves in an infinitely better way , " said makiya . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past .

it would be the eu ’ s third peacekeeping mission after operations in the democratic republic of congo and in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
there has been some debate about exactly when the eu will be ready to safeguard the fragile peace , which has followed years of inter-ethnic warfare in the early 1990s .
" it is a bit difficult to give an exact date .
of course a lot of military planning is necessary .
you ca n't do this overnight , " said the new nato chief , jaap de hoop scheffer .
the eu ’ s head of foreign policy , javier solana , said he was convinced the union is ready for the operation .
the u.s. has continuously voiced its concern about the eu ’ s ability to successfully take over from nato ’ s sfor force .
the eu currently has a police mission in the country and would be expected to provide around 6,000 personnel for the peacekeeping force .
nato ’ s current forces in the country stand at double that figure but will be reduced to 7,000 by june 2004 .
final decisions on the date for the eu takeover are likely to come at a key nato meeting in istanbul in june .

"
mentioning switzerland , he said , " i think that in the not too distant future people will pay with the euro in switzerland .
because there , after several referendums , it will be recognized that the euro is good for switzerland . "
he also cited the ukraine as a possible euro member outside the eu .
the former leader believes that this would be a good way to bring countries that do not have the possibility of joining the eu closer to brussels .
kohl , who is considered one of the architects of the euro , criticized present eu countries who have decided to retain their own currencies - the uk , sweden and denmark .
" some european union countries have not adopted the euro .
one could say they have stepped on the brakes .
but time is against the laggards , " kohl said .
he also criticized the idea of a two-speed europe .
" it would be damaging to allow a two-speed europe , " he said adding that none of the new member states are in favor of such an idea .
kohl also rejected the german strategy of linking future funding to the question of the constitution .
he said it is " bad style to threaten that this country or that country will get no more money after a failure -lsb- of the talks -rsb- . "

"
the report concedes , " the union can not catch up on the united states as our per capita gdp is 72 percent of our american partner ’ s . "
commission president romano prodi confirmed that the eu would miss its targets and said , " this should be a strong enough message to serve as a wake-up call to governments . "
according to the report , the eu lags behind the u.s. in jobs , productivity and investment .
the commission blames member states for these failings , saying they have not implemented crucial reforms .
other observers outside the commission blame brussels for not setting better guidelines .

"
mentioning switzerland , he said , " i think that in the not too distant future people will pay with the euro in switzerland .
because there , after several referendums , it will be recognized that the euro is good for switzerland . "
he also cited the ukraine as a possible euro member outside the eu .
the former leader believes that this would be a good way to bring countries that do not have the possibility of joining the eu closer to brussels .
kohl , who is considered one of the architects of the euro , criticized present eu countries who have decided to retain their own currencies - the uk , sweden and denmark .
" some european union countries have not adopted the euro .
one could say they have stepped on the brakes .
but time is against the laggards , " kohl said .
he also criticized the idea of a two-speed europe .
" it would be damaging to allow a two-speed europe , " he said adding that none of the new member states are in favor of such an idea .
kohl also rejected the german strategy of linking future funding to the question of the constitution .
he said it is " bad style to threaten that this country or that country will get no more money after a failure -lsb- of the talks -rsb- . "

"
mentioning switzerland , he said , " i think that in the not too distant future people will pay with the euro in switzerland .
because there , after several referendums , it will be recognized that the euro is good for switzerland . "
he also cited the ukraine as a possible euro member outside the eu .
the former leader believes that this would be a good way to bring countries that do not have the possibility of joining the eu closer to brussels .
kohl , who is considered one of the architects of the euro , criticized present eu countries who have decided to retain their own currencies - the uk , sweden and denmark .
" some european union countries have not adopted the euro .
one could say they have stepped on the brakes .
but time is against the laggards , " kohl said .
he also criticized the idea of a two-speed europe .
" it would be damaging to allow a two-speed europe , " he said adding that none of the new member states are in favor of such an idea .
kohl also rejected the german strategy of linking future funding to the question of the constitution .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .
both sides have the option to appeal to the court ’ s grand chamber , which includes 17 judges .
germany 's constitutional court had ruled in favor of the dispossession in 2000 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin library caught up in controversial legal battle controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .

it would be the eu ’ s third peacekeeping mission after operations in the democratic republic of congo and in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
there has been some debate about exactly when the eu will be ready to safeguard the fragile peace , which has followed years of inter-ethnic warfare in the early 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.01.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc former german leader says non-eu countries could join euro kohl , who was leader of germany from 1982 to 1998 , told the paper , " i can imagine that one or the other country will adopt the euro without becoming an eu member . "
mentioning switzerland , he said , " i think that in the not too distant future people will pay with the euro in switzerland .
because there , after several referendums , it will be recognized that the euro is good for switzerland . "
he also cited the ukraine as a possible euro member outside the eu .
the former leader believes that this would be a good way to bring countries that do not have the possibility of joining the eu closer to brussels .
kohl , who is considered one of the architects of the euro , criticized present eu countries who have decided to retain their own currencies - the uk , sweden and denmark .
" some european union countries have not adopted the euro .
one could say they have stepped on the brakes .
but time is against the laggards , " kohl said .
he also criticized the idea of a two-speed europe .
" it would be damaging to allow a two-speed europe , " he said adding that none of the new member states are in favor of such an idea .
kohl also rejected the german strategy of linking future funding to the question of the constitution .
he said it is " bad style to threaten that this country or that country will get no more money after a failure -lsb- of the talks -rsb- . "

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .
germany should have compensated the owners , the judges continued .
by not doing so , it violated an amendment to the european convention on human rights , which protects private property .
germany has signed the convention and is therefore required to accept decisions by the court . the court ’ s unanimous decision was handed down by a chamber of seven judges .

the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal . up to 70,000 heirs of farm land in eastern germany could claim compensation after thursday ’ s ruling .
the lawsuit wasn filed by five germans , who had inherited land in eastern germany but were forced to hand it over to the state without compensation after reunification .
their families had been given the land following east germany ’ s 1945 agrarian reform . later on , these so-called new farmers were forced to join large-scale agricultural cooperatives .
but in 1990 , east germany ’ s first and only democratically elected parliament gave back full ownership rights to them . after reunification , the german parliament passed legislation limiting ownership rights to those families that had actually worked in the agricultural sector .
all others had to hand over titles to the land without compensation . no dispossession without compensation the european court of human rights in strasbourg acknowledged that germany found itself in an extraordinary position after reunification and even recognized the new united german parliament ’ s right to throw out the 1990 east german law that granted ownership to the land . “ however , a fair balance had to be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights , ” the court ’ s decision read .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .

about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .
" an archive like this , down the line , will change the way iraqis think of themselves in an infinitely better way , " said makiya . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .

about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .

germany 's archive of documents on the former communist regime is a good example for iraq , say two scholars who are collecting millions of documents they hope will be evidence in trials against hussein and his cohorts . on his first trip to germany 's archive on east germany 's secret police , iraqi archivist hassan mneimneh was speechless . the rows and rows of file folders , neatly categorized and containing the dirty secrets of the german democratic republic is exactly the type of place he hopes to see in baghdad one day . " i felt as if i had walked into an ideal future , ten years later , " said mneimneh , who has been gathering documents on the saddam hussein regime together with the prominent iraqi author kanan makiya for more than 12 years . " what you have here , we can only dream about . " the berlin trip was part of the iraqi memory foundation , a washington-based organization founded by makiya .
over the past 12 years the author and brandeis university professor has mined information out of thousands of pages of documents captured by iraqi kurdish fighters following their insurgence in 1991 . following the collapse of saddam hussein 's regime in may 2003 , that number jumped to hundreds of millions of pages . now , makiya and mneimneh face the herculean task of tracking down the estimated 350 million pages of documents , covering everything from the daily correspondence in hussein 's baathist regime to the location of victims killed and buried by hussein 's secret services . the two believe no one can help better than the germans , who have dealt with a sordid past not once , but twice . " we are here to learn from germany 's experiences because it is more thorough than any other country we have looked at , " said makiya .
" we desperately need you inside iraq , helping make these decisions . " birthler ca n't promise much bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , erlaeutert auf der berliner bundespressekonferenz am freitag , 12 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- the birthler authority , which gets its name from director marianne birthler , has spent the past 12 years collecting and poring over the records of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
the experience of its archivists , as well as the systems and laws created to allow public access to the records would be of immense use , said makiya . birthler said on thursday she would be happy to lend any assistance , but admitted that as a government agency , she could n't promise much .
the german government , one of the staunchest opponents to the iraq war , has so far refused to involve itself on a large scale in iraq until the united nations is given greater control .
makiya urged germany to take more initiative .
" do n't wait for the united nations , we need you now , " he pleaded in front of cameras and microphones at the press conference . paper trail crucial in prosecuting saddam on the long list of major problems that need to be taken care of in iraq , a documentation center might not seem like such a big priority .
but the acquisition , storage and examination of such documents has taken on greater urgency as regime leaders , including saddam hussein , come into coalition forces custody . " now is the time we should be working to provide evidentiary support to try these people , " makiya said .
" we need a paper trail for the regime itself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das foto zeigt teile der zentralen klarnamen kartei f16 im archiv der stasi-akten-behoerde bstu am dienstag , 8 .
juli 2003 , in berlin .
die bundesbeauftragte fuer die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr , marianne birthler , gab heute auf einer pressekonferenz bekannt , dass die so genannten " rosenholz " -daten der bundesrepublik von den usa an deutschland uebergeben wurden .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- there are an estimated 350 million pages of documents surviving from the baathist regime .
about 80 percent of them are currently in coalition forces ' hands .
the remaining 20 percent are split between political parties and scavengers , said mneimneh . the lion 's share of the work in the coming months will be convincing people to hand over documents , or at least detailing the contents of their archives .
a mammoth task , considering the memory foundation has almost no employees and no funding aside from a $ 1 million pledge from the u.s. congress . mneimneh , who works out of an office in baghdad 's high-security zone , says they need $ 10 million in order to get the most important documents , those relating to victims and regime atrocities , categorized and examined in the next two to five years .
" an archive like this , down the line , will change the way iraqis think of themselves in an infinitely better way , " said makiya . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past .

demonstrations are expected in paris and other major french cities .
the french health service is running an annual budget deficit of 10bn euros -lrb- £ 8bn -rrb- - a deficit the government says it is determined to cut .
the strikes come after a walk-out by french rail workers , which brought disruption to commuter train services around paris on wednesday .
the health strike comes a day after rail staff walked out the french health service is currently rated the best in the world , with patients gaining immediate access to the necessary treatment .
but it comes at a high price ; a price the french government says the country can no longer afford .
despite devoting huge sums to the health service , it is running a massive budget deficit .
that is partly because french patients can go straight to the specialist of their choice - and keep going to as many doctors as they like , for as many tests as they want .
the french also take more prescription drugs than any other nation in europe , and expect brand name drugs , not the cheaper generic version .
the government here has been cautious about tackling health reform in the past but an ageing population is now putting more pressure on the health service than ever while providing less tax revenue to fund it .
however , the french health minister jean-francois mattei has promised one thing : france will not end up with a health service modelled on either its british or american counterparts .

the judgement will be a blow to walt disney , which was supporting clare milne in the hope of winning back the rights from the slesinger family .
the slesingers have the us rights to pooh , and have accused entertainment giant disney of withholding royalties .
the final trial in the case is now scheduled for january 2005 .
bitter battle the struggle over pooh has been one of the bitterest and longest-running sagas in us legal history .
the case goes back to the 1930s , when stephen slesinger acquired us rights to winnie the pooh from the author .
disney was enlisted to market pooh-related goods , which have ballooned into a multi-million-dollar concern spanning movies , books , toys and games and hi-tech products .
the slesingers sued disney in 1991 , arguing that they had not been given their share of the healthy profits generated by the character , disney , which denies having short-changed the slesingers , has accused the family of hiring detectives to steal company documents .
the slesingers , meanwhile , have accused disney of manipulating ms milne , who was brought into the case in 2002 .
ms milne has agreed to continue marketing pooh merchandise via disney if she recaptures the rights .
the main event the decision leaves the way finally clear for the original trial to go ahead in a year 's time .
the event promises to be spectacular , gathering together some of america 's highest-profile legal talent .
top of the bill will be johnnie cochran , arguably the most famous lawyer in the us , who was hired last year by the slesingers .

the joint report by a charity and university found the number of elderly mortalities over winter was directly linked to a region 's deprivation .
the energy action scotland and university of strathclyde study concluded that warm homes save lives .
the chance of premature death was highest among oaps in glasgow and lower in rural or more well-off areas .
pensioners in scotland 's biggest city were found to be most at risk , with one-in-36 of those aged over 65 dying during the winter months . "
these deaths are essentially preventable if the elderly live in warm , dry homes " dr stirling howieson university of strathclyde glasgow is the poorest region on the scottish index of multiple deprivation as published by the scottish executive .
it does not compare favourably with scottish cities that are generally colder but have higher levels of affluence .
the risk of premature death among pensioners in edinburgh was one-in-48 , and one-in-44 in aberdeen .
energy action scotland director ann loughrey said : " we need to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and the effect this has on health . "
she said the deaths appeared not to be influenced significantly by climate , house type , energy efficiency and access to the gas network .
cold conditions the study appeared to disprove a perception that rural areas would suffer higher death rates among pensioners .
in dumfries and galloway the rate was one-in-64 while shetland and orkney recorded one-in-45 deaths , said the authors .
least at risk in scotland were those elderly living in north ayrshire , where the figure fell to one-in-68 . "
we have made significant strides in tackling fuel poverty , the numbers have been reduced by half " margaret curran communities minister dr stirling howieson , of the university of strathclyde 's department of architecture and building science , said the deaths were fully avoidable .
he said : " winter deaths occur mainly among the elderly and about 90 % are from heart , stroke and respiratory diseases .
" all of these are known to be exacerbated by cold living conditions .
these deaths are essentially preventable if the elderly live in warm , dry homes . "

the joint report by a charity and university found the number of elderly mortalities over winter was directly linked to a region 's deprivation .
the energy action scotland and university of strathclyde study concluded that warm homes save lives .
the chance of premature death was highest among oaps in glasgow and lower in rural or more well-off areas .
pensioners in scotland 's biggest city were found to be most at risk , with one-in-36 of those aged over 65 dying during the winter months .
these deaths are essentially preventable if the elderly live in warm , dry homes dr stirling howieson university of strathclyde glasgow is the poorest region on the scottish index of multiple deprivation as published by the scottish executive .
it does not compare favourably with scottish cities that are generally colder but have higher levels of affluence .
the risk of premature death among pensioners in edinburgh was one-in-48 , and one-in-44 in aberdeen .
energy action scotland director ann loughrey said : " we need to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and the effect this has on health . "
she said the deaths appeared not to be influenced significantly by climate , house type , energy efficiency and access to the gas network .
cold conditions the study appeared to disprove a perception that rural areas would suffer higher death rates among pensioners .
in dumfries and galloway the rate was one-in-64 while shetland and orkney recorded one-in-45 deaths , said the authors .
least at risk in scotland were those elderly living in north ayrshire , where the figure fell to one-in-68 .
we have made significant strides in tackling fuel poverty , the numbers have been reduced by half margaret curran communities minister dr stirling howieson , of the university of strathclyde 's department of architecture and building science , said the deaths were fully avoidable .
he said : " winter deaths occur mainly among the elderly and about 90 % are from heart , stroke and respiratory diseases .
" all of these are known to be exacerbated by cold living conditions .
these deaths are essentially preventable if the elderly live in warm , dry homes . "
the scottish executive defended its record on pensioner poverty .
communities minister margaret curran said : " we have made significant strides in tackling fuel poverty , the numbers have been reduced by half .
" we 've got a significant central heating programme , probably the most popular programmes ever inaugurated by government , we are really beginning to bite into this problem . "

crew members say they want to talk to pair trawler fishermen who are blamed for the deaths .
the charity says it felt compelled to act before the creatures become extinct .
in a joint report , the net effect ? , the groups estimate around 10,000 animals die annually on uk and french coasts .
figures for 2002-2003 show 250 cetaceans were found dead on cornwall 's beaches while 80 were found on devon 's shores .
this year conservationists expect the figure to be even higher .

the report , which pulls together existing knowledge on cetaceans -lrb- whales , dolphins and porpoises -rrb- around the uk coast , blames the huge nets towed by two vessels for much of the carnage .
these pair trawls are used in the sea bass fishery , which runs from october to april .
the report says fishing for mackerel , hake , albacore tuna and horse mackerel also threatens common and atlantic white-sided dolphins , bottlenose dolphins and long-finned pilot whales .

hundreds of dead cetaceans wash up on the coasts of south-west england and north-west france each winter .

" the bodies of thousands of others never wash up and are claimed by the ocean .
it is estimated that around 10,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in nets in this region every year . "
they say fishing methods could be pushing some species towards extinction , and that the common dolphin could be declining by an unsustainable 5 % annually .
lack of information last year richard sabin , coordinator of the national whale stranding recording scheme at the natural history museum in london , said the numbers of small cetaceans dying in the area were far above the 1.7 % of the population which scientists think is the maximum sustainable annual loss .
but he told bbc news online the baseline data did not exist to say whether any species faced extinction in the uk .
greenpeace says there must be observers on as many fishing vessels as possible , not just the 5-10 % of the fleet proposed by the european commission .
it also wants action taken against fisheries found to be responsible for any cetacean bycatch .

crew members say they want to talk to pair trawler fishermen who are blamed for the deaths .
the charity says it felt compelled to act before the creatures become extinct .
in a joint report , the net effect ? , the groups estimate around 10,000 animals die annually on uk and french coasts .
figures for 2002-2003 show 250 cetaceans were found dead on cornwall 's beaches while 80 were found on devon 's shores .
this year conservationists expect the figure to be even higher .
they welcome european union initiatives aimed at protecting the creatures , but say they do not go nearly far enough .

some show signs of trauma its crew will document the amount of bycatch -lrb- dolphins and porpoises caught accidentally -rrb- in the nets , while a whale and dolphin conservation society team will study the behaviour of the mammals round the nets .
the report , which pulls together existing knowledge on cetaceans -lrb- whales , dolphins and porpoises -rrb- around the uk coast , blames the huge nets towed by two vessels for much of the carnage .
these pair trawls are used in the sea bass fishery , which runs from october to april .
the report says fishing for mackerel , hake , albacore tuna and horse mackerel also threatens common and atlantic white-sided dolphins , bottlenose dolphins and long-finned pilot whales .
but andrew pillar of interfish , a fish processing company in the west of england , told bbc news online observers from the sea mammal research unit had confirmed that mackerel pair trawls did not threaten cetaceans .
hundreds of dead cetaceans wash up on the coasts of south-west england and north-west france each winter .
the two groups say : " many have sustained injuries - broken beaks , torn flippers , bruising and lacerations - which tell the story of a prolonged death in fishing nets .
" the bodies of thousands of others never wash up and are claimed by the ocean .
it is estimated that around 10,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in nets in this region every year . "
they say fishing methods could be pushing some species towards extinction , and that the common dolphin could be declining by an unsustainable 5 % annually .
lack of information last year richard sabin , coordinator of the national whale stranding recording scheme at the natural history museum in london , said the numbers of small cetaceans dying in the area were far above the 1.7 % of the population which scientists think is the maximum sustainable annual loss .
but he told bbc news online the baseline data did not exist to say whether any species faced extinction in the uk .
greenpeace says there must be observers on as many fishing vessels as possible , not just the 5-10 % of the fleet proposed by the european commission .
it also wants action taken against fisheries found to be responsible for any cetacean bycatch .

sir kevin tebbit was grilled after defence secretary geoff hoon faced calls to resign over the issue .
sir kevin said 38,000 sets of armour were sent to the gulf and he was sorry it did not reach every british soldier .
but the decision to use enhanced armour instead of standard flak jackets that were available had come late , he added .
' arrogance ' sir kevin confirmed the equipment may in the future become standard issue for all soldiers .
that move comes after the row over the death of cornwall-born sergeant steve roberts , who was killed in iraq days after being ordered to give his body armour to another unit .
if i was a soldier being led by some of the hierarchy i see at this table , i would be bloody worried , to be quite honest gerry steinberg labour mp sir kevin 's appearance also came the day before lieutenant colonel james cowan , the commanding officer of scottish regiment , the black watch , told the scotsman that men were left with a shortage of equipment due to the government 's unwillingness to commit to war until all possible alternatives had been explored .
during a heated commons public administration committee session , sir kevin was forced to deny accusations by labour 's gerry steinberg that he was being " arrogant and complacent " .
" i think soldiers may have died because of the failures of your department , " mr steinberg told the civil servant .
" i know it is beneath you to come to this meeting ... but you could at least give us the courtesy of answering our questions .
" if i was a soldier being led by some of the hierarchy i see at this table , i would be bloody worried , to be quite honest . "
sir kevin said it was " completely wrong " to accuse the department of complacency .
speed problem the issue of military equipment shortages during the iraq war came to the fore in a report by the national audit office - the public spending watchdog - that praised the overall success of the operation but highlighted some supply problems .
sir kevin told mps the shortfalls were not only down to faults in the systems for tracking supplies once they were sent out to the gulf , but also the speed with which troops were deployed .
the committee heard there were enough sets of standard combat body armour for all troops. but it was only in october 2002 that military commanders decided soldiers should have the enhanced body armour .
had there been longer to prepare ... they would have been able to take more with them sir kevin tebbit and it was still another month before mr hoon finally authorised full military preparations , sir kevin said .
changes to the battle plan , especially the decision not to enter iraq through northern turkey , had also added to the logistical challenges , the mps heard .
sir kevin urged people to wait until boards of inquiry reported before judging on the deaths of individual soldiers .
but he was " gravely concerned and sorry " the enhanced kit did not reach all soldiers .
labour 's alan williams also suggested the fact that some tank units did not have filters against chemical and biological weapons was a " damning indictment " of a department sending people into war .
the mps were told that some units did receive the filters but chose not to fit them to their vehicles .
questioned by another mps ' committee on wednesday , deputy chief of defence staff lieutenant general anthony palmer denied kit shortages had severely hit troops ' morale .

new business sales for insurance products in 2003 fell to £ 1.6bn -lrb- $ 2.92bn -rrb- , from £ 1.92bn.
prudential said " uncertainty surrounding the continuing government and regulatory reviews " had dented its outlook for the first half of 2004 .
but the uk group said it was optimistic about growth in asia and the us .
weaker uk market the majority of prudential 's overall revenue is generated outside britain .
the group 's lacklustre tone contrasted with that of larger uk rival aviva , which started the sales reporting season earlier this week with a robust market outlook for the year .
prudential said the fall in new sales came largely on the back of the company 's exposure to the struggling with-profits market in the uk , as well as poor institutional sales in the us .
analysts had forecast sales of between £ 1.570bn and £ 1.643bn , with a consensus of £ 1.601bn , a figure measured on an annual premium equivalent basis - a standard measure used to iron out volatility .
meanwhile , prudential - which is britain 's second largest insurer - said talks over the possible sale of its 79 % stake in loss-making online bank egg were continuing .

the problem is at its worst in the western isles where 75 % have an occupancy rate of 60 % or less .
councils in argyll and bute , glasgow , inverclyde and shetland reported that at least half of their schools were only 60 % occupied or less .
the accounts commission , which produced the figures , said it was concerned at the findings .
local authorities responsible for dundee , east ayrshire , highland , orkney , south lanarkshire and west dunbartonshire all reported under-occupancy in at least 40 % of their schools .
accounts commission chairman alastair macnish said : " we are concerned at the low levels of school occupancy in several areas across scotland .

he said : " local government is continually being told we need to achieve best value in everything that we do and looking at rationalisation and catchment areas is one way of securing this .
" on such a sensitive issue , councils are always the ones left with the difficult decisions between competing priorities . "
the scottish executive said it has an " ambitious " school refurbishment programme across scotland .
a spokeswoman said : " it is for local authorities to determine the number and location of schools , and they are already taking falling school rolls into account when planning new building and refurbishment . "

supporters say the plans to upgrade the station and build new homes , offices and shops between the site and wembley town centre will boost its economy .
but some residents say plans have changed dramatically since they were first suggested .
they fear too many homes are being proposed for the area .
anne tremmink , from the wembley hill residents ' association , told bbc london : " our main worries are that it 's going to be overcrowded and under-resourced and have a huge impact on the rest of wembley . "
she calculates the plans for the site , along with other developments planned for the area , would mean more than 4,000 new homes being built .
work on the new stadium began in september 2002 " i feel as if we have been hoodwinked , " she said .
the plans are supported by the mayor 's london development agency -lrb- lda -rrb- and brent council .
proposals for the site also include a pedestrian bridge linking the stadium to the town centre , a new public square and the clearing of derelict land .
developers say only 500 new homes will be created .
gareth blacker , development director at lda , said the plans would not only benefit visitors to the stadium , but would stimulate the local economy .
" it will enable thousands of people to arrive at the stadium and leave it quickly , without creating disruption to local roads , " he said .

the broadband stakeholders group -lrb- bsg -rrb- , said in its annual report that the uk is on target to give every community broadband access by 2005 .
but the government needs to think about its visions for next generation broadband , and set its goals for 2010 .
the government has promised to make the uk the most competitive broadband market among the g7 countries .
' more to do ' e-commerce minister stephen timms agreed that efforts to create a " broadband britain " should not be relaxed .
" excellent progress has been made in the last 12 months with a big increase in coverage , choice and take-up of broadband , " he said .
" however , we agree with the bsg that there is more to do .
bsg 's future challenges creating , delivering and exploiting value building a thriving and competitive content industry encouraging investment in next generation broadband developing new broadband environments eg wireless bridging the digital divide " the widespread adoption and use of broadband is key to further improving uk business productivity and competitiveness . "
the chairman of the bsg , keith todd , added that all stakeholders , including public , private and the voluntary sector , still had a big job ahead to ensure broadband take-up in all areas of the country .
but he also stressed there was still work to be done in showing people who have broadband how it could benefit them .
challenging times the bsg identified several challenges which it said the government had to fit into its broadband policy .
these included cultivating the market for providing creative and useful content which makes use of broadband technology , and continued investment into new broadband technologies and infrastructure , like wireless technologies .
it was also concerned that barriers to getting broadband , like geography , economics and social inequalities , were broken down so that everyone could get the most out of high-speed net .
bt , the dominant player in providing the infrastructure which delivers broadband through fixed phone lines , welcomed the report and agreed with its concerns .
alison ritchie , chief bt broadband officer , said the challenge was to cultivate and maintain a properly regulated and competitive market place to encourage investment in infrastructure , particularly as it was such a fast-moving technology .
" people may focus on dsl and cable at the moment , but broadband is much more than these two services , " she said .
" it will soon include 3g , satellite , wi-fi and other wireless services .
this is a fast moving environment and it is vital that ofcom acts with these future developments in mind . "

the broadband stakeholders group -lrb- bsg -rrb- , said in its annual report that the uk is on target to give every community broadband access by 2005 .
but the government needs to think about its visions for next generation broadband , and set its goals for 2010 .
the government has promised to make the uk the most competitive broadband market among the g7 countries .
' more to do ' e-commerce minister stephen timms agreed that efforts to create a " broadband britain " should not be relaxed .
" excellent progress has been made in the last 12 months with a big increase in coverage , choice and take-up of broadband , " he said .
" however , we agree with the bsg that there is more to do .
bsg 's future challenges creating , delivering and exploiting value building a thriving and competitive content industry encouraging investment in next generation broadband developing new broadband environments eg wireless bridging the digital divide " the widespread adoption and use of broadband is key to further improving uk business productivity and competitiveness . "
the chairman of the bsg , keith todd , added that all stakeholders , including public , private and the voluntary sector , still had a big job ahead to ensure broadband take-up in all areas of the country .
but he also stressed there was still work to be done in showing people who have broadband how it could benefit them .
challenging times the bsg identified several challenges which it said the government had to fit into its broadband policy .
these included cultivating the market for providing creative and useful content which makes use of broadband technology , and continued investment into new broadband technologies and infrastructure , like wireless technologies .
it was also concerned that barriers to getting broadband , like geography , economics and social inequalities , were broken down so that everyone could get the most out of high-speed net .
bt , the dominant player in providing the infrastructure which delivers broadband through fixed phone lines , welcomed the report and agreed with its concerns .
alison ritchie , chief bt broadband officer , said the challenge was to cultivate and maintain a properly regulated and competitive market place to encourage investment in infrastructure , particularly as it was such a fast-moving technology .
" people may focus on dsl and cable at the moment , but broadband is much more than these two services , " she said .
" it will soon include 3g , satellite , wi-fi and other wireless services .
this is a fast moving environment and it is vital that ofcom acts with these future developments in mind . "

the lads ask what they are doing at the weekend , and the girls are shown hard at work in an army training camp .
finally the two lads ask for their phone numbers , and the women reveal their names : " captain colley and lieutenant reynolds " .
what 's going on here ?
army recruiting campaigns have come a long way since lord kitchener and " your country needs you " .
appeals to patriotism and a promise to " see the world " no longer cut any ice .
these days , the emphasis is on personal fulfilment .
join the forces and set yourself apart from the common herd is the message .
forget those losers down the pub showing off their new mobiles or doing handbrake turns in the car park , you are out there doing it for real . ... and in training for the ta like mobile or car commercials , recruitment ads promise self-expression and a chance to be part of something , but with real substance .
after all , joining the army - unlike buying a 3g phone or a new car - really can change your life .
or , for that matter , end it .
the benchmark was set by saatchi and saatchi 's award-winning be the best campaign , which virtually doubled the number of recruits between 1993 and 1999 .
the latest territorial army ads , created by french-owned agency publicis , parent company of saatchi and saatchi , and directed by peter cattaneo , of full monty fame , are a subtle evolution of this approach , focusing on individual service careers .
it is the first to directly promote ta medical services , which have been much in demand since the start of the war in iraq , but is also part of a wider push to recruit health professionals .
the nurses featured have both recently served overseas .
it 's a neat gender role reversal .
the women are the action heroes , while the lads are stuck at home practising their stale chat-up lines .
could you ?
as always with good recruitment ads , the key is careful targeting .
the ta - or indeed teaching , policing or working in a hospital - is not for everyone .
only a relatively small minority of people would ever dream of joining up .
the trick is to turn that idle curiosity into action .
are you tough enough ?
there is also real danger in over-selling the product .
drop-out rates in the public services - particularly in professions such as nursing and teaching - remain relatively high .
if the reality of the job falls far short of that promised by the ad , it can only make matters worse .
but a feel good campaign that also manages to be realistic can boost morale and help new recruits feel they have made the right choice .
the army 's approach has been copied by other public service professions .
the teacher training agency , which has the task of recruiting 30,000 new teachers annually , has tried a number of different approaches over the years .
its latest campaign features headless people trapped in the daily grind .
the pay-off is a science teacher in full possession of a cranium -lrb- albeit a bald one -rrb- , entertaining a class of well-behaved teenagers .
by being a teacher he is " using his head " .
the heroine of a nursery school machete attack in the police ads the metropolitan police attempts to combine celebrity endorsement with personal fulfilment , with its " i 'm not sure i could do that " ads .
in these , the likes of lennox lewis and patsy palmer speak about how they would struggle to meet the challenges faced by the average copper .
all public services go in for some form of relationship marketing , but here again the army has set the pace .
its camouflage loyalty programme now has more than 120,000 members aged between 13 and 17 .
the idea is to build and maintain contact with prospective recruits during their formative years .
the next step , according to tequila , the agency appointed last year to develop the programme , is to form alliances with other youth-orientated brands .
the ta is also moving into motor racing sponsorship at northamptonshire 's rockingham motor speedway , raising the slightly disconcerting prospect of a racing car in full military camouflage .
it is indeed a far cry from lord kitchener .
