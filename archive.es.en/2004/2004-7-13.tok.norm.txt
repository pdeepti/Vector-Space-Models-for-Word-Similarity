ulrich küchl , the seminary director , has already resigned and his deputy , wolfgang rothe , was quoted by the magazine as saying he would also resign , without admitting any guilt .
profil said both küchl and rothe had homosexual relations with students , using pedophile photos for stimulation . church leaders call for bishop to go both men are said to be close to the bishop of sankt pölten , kurt krenn , who said a picture showing rothe kissing a young seminarian had " absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality " , and was merely the kind of " idiocy " boys get up to .
austrian radio reports have revealed that senior church figures were on the point of petitioning the vatican to remove bishop krenn . gay relations between consenting adults is not illegal in austria , but a church official said the seminary directors might have abused their positions to put pressure on students .
the magazine wrote that it is the most serious scandal in the austrian catholic church since cardinal hans hermann groer was forced to resign in 1995 over allegations of pedophilia . the revelations come hard on the heels of more cases of alleged abuse coming to light in the united states and a report by the roman catholic church in england and wales that shows that 52 priests and church workers were accused of sexual abuse against children last year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .

follini has called for the broadcaster to be made entirely independent .

berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules . " we welcome the ruling by the european court of justice .
it affirms the legality of the decision by the council of ministers on nov .
25 , 2003 , " german finance ministry spokesperson jörg müller said in a statement on tuesday .
in the ruling , which annulled the decision by the council of finance ministers to suspend disciplinary sanctions against germany and france for violating the stability pact 's budget deficit ceiling of three percent , the court also noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the ministers .
" there is no automatism in the deficit procedures , " müller said interpreting the court 's verdict .
" in fact , the council has room to make decisions and the council made use of that room for maneuver . "
he said the court 's decision was also a " clear signal to the council of ministers and the eu commission to cooperate in issues regarding the application of the stability and growth pact .
a red flag for eichel ?

the report revealed that the algerian has applied for a visa to join his family in germany , which had been agreed by the foreign ministry office in schleswig-holstein . questions raised but algerian remained it showed that while there were judicial questions over the granting of the visa in november last year , the algerian had already been granted permission to enter germany .
the state ministry in kiel was quoted as saying that , while sofiane yacine f. is merely under suspicion of being a terrorist , he is allowed to walk free . after the broadcast , the federal foreign ministry confirmed that , although algerian 's name cropped up on the revised edition of the eu 's list of 50 suspected terrorists and organizations on may 17 this year , he still continues to live freely in schleswig-holstein .
it added that since the revelation came to light , a lawsuit to reverse the visa decision has been put before the administrative court in berlin . bosbach challenges government the conservative opposition faction 's number two wolfgang bosbach has demanded that the social democrat government investigate how the visa was allowed to be issued to a suspected terrorist and for stringent regulations to be put in place to ensure such a mistake does n't happen again .
the federal government must demonstrate " that it wants to close this security gap , " said bosbach in tuesday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
" to reduce the risks , we need a visas-warning file .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .
from germany to italy to malta , nobody wants to get their fingers burnt .
nobody wants to set a precedent .
that 's why we need a centralized european asylum policy .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .

meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .

while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .

the first students are graduating . on the main market square in pirna , a town of 40,000 near dresden , a group of students are sketching the renaissance gate of their boarding school .
their teacher , dagmar jäger , is teaching them about light and shadow , perspective and depth as any art teacher will .
she does it , however , not in german but in czech , the language of the country next door . the students at the friedrich schiller gymnasium , a secondary school for students who want to go on to get a university degree , learn about art in czech , for instance , but get their music history and theory in the language of the school 's namesake , in german . " there are a few complications , but it works out ok .
you can make yourself understood , " said german student simon hegewald .
" you use a few hand signals and it 's fine . " " or the germans help help us out , " added jana metkova from the czech republic .
" if we do n't understand something , we ask the germans and they translate or explain it somehow . " four years ago , the school began its binational german-czech project , a school aimed at building bridges between the two neighbors whose wounds from world war two are still too raw in some quarters .
in the program , students learn each other 's language and about each other 's cultures , not to mention math , science and art .
in addition to getting a diploma from the state of saxony , czech students get a degree recognized by the czech republic .
every class since 1998 has had 15 german and 15 czech students . while most of the german students commute to classes daily from their parents ' homes , the czech students live at the school and go home only on the weekends . " at first i did n't want to go to germany because i was afraid i would n't understand anything , " said metkova .
" but then my parents told me it would be good .
so i thought about it and then said yes . " challenging four years bernd wenzel is one of those quiet types who works hard but does n't trumpet it .
although in reality he is the driving force behind the success of the school , he says the school was almost forced into existence , since pirna lies so close to the czech border .
he is proud of what the school has accomplished in the past four years , even if it 's been a lot of hard work . " i 'll say this , a boarding school and binational instruction , that adds a completely new dimension to things , " he said .
" it is an immense workload in a very short period of time . " teacher petra pastevera , from olemuc in the czech republic , has been at the school for two years .
she came to germany to teach at a binational school driven by her idealistic views of bridging the gulf that separates the two countries and putting niggling old animosities to rest .
but she has been somewhat disappointed , however , since according to her , most of the students have come simply to improve their job prospects .
they do n't see the pirna school as anything special , she said . " they do n't appreciate the fact that they 're here in germany and could gain so much from their time here , " she added .
" they also do n't leave the school to make contacts .
they just see the whole thing as a necessary evil .

experts anticipate a steadily growing industry that will be among the most important in the world in a few decades . the threat of terrorism was only able to dampen the mood in the tourism industry for a few short years .
if the world tourism barometer is right , 2004 will continue the upwards trend of 2003 , the first recovery year following the sept .

up to one-fifth of europe 's combined gross domestic product depends on tourism .
worldwide , tourism has long replaced cars as the biggest export , according to the imf .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .
from germany to italy to malta , nobody wants to get their fingers burnt .
nobody wants to set a precedent .
that 's why we need a centralized european asylum policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 court annulls eu stability pact suspension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ruling a red flag for the german finance minister ?
the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .
from germany to italy to malta , nobody wants to get their fingers burnt .
nobody wants to set a precedent .
that 's why we need a centralized european asylum policy .

" ministers have made clear their opposition to the restoration of the death penalty , " read a statement released by the 25-member bloc after the meeting .
capital punishment was suspended after the u.s.-led invasion although senior officials in iraq have called for its reinstatement for a limited range of crimes after the amnesty period .
if that occurs , former president saddam hussein could be executed .
zebari said he himself had campaigned against the death penalty although he said the situation on the ground in iraq might call for its reinstatement .
" there is a need for the new government to be more decisive and tougher in its actions to bring the security situation under control , " he said .
" we need a deterrence against those elements .
iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi had intended to travel to brussels at the invitation of the eu 's dutch presidency .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
more aid requested even if iraq does reinstate the death penalty , there was no talk on monday as that being an obstacle to eu aid to the country , set to be around € 200 million -lrb- $ 248 million -rrb- annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's foreign minister hoshyar zebari in brussels , zebari -lrb- photo -rrb- quickly asked the eu for more support .
" we have requested the support of the eu ... for more direct assistance , although we are grateful and appreciative of all the support they have offered us , " he said .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 court annulls eu stability pact suspension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ruling a red flag for the german finance minister ?
the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .
later this year the eu executive is expected to propose reforms to make the guidelines more flexible . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes court ruling berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .
later this year the eu executive is expected to propose reforms to make the guidelines more flexible . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes court ruling berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules .

meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .
right now solar collectors in china produce as much energy as three nuclear power plants .
germany is seeking to support solar power development in china over the long term . erik campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pursues better business ties to india though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin .

the report revealed that the algerian has applied for a visa to join his family in germany , which had been agreed by the foreign ministry office in schleswig-holstein . questions raised but algerian remained it showed that while there were judicial questions over the granting of the visa in november last year , the algerian had already been granted permission to enter germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2004 german foreign minister heads to asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first stop : india joschka fischer is gearing up for a 10-day tour of asia .
meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .
right now solar collectors in china produce as much energy as three nuclear power plants .
germany is seeking to support solar power development in china over the long term . erik campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pursues better business ties to india though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin .

meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .

experts anticipate a steadily growing industry that will be among the most important in the world in a few decades . the threat of terrorism was only able to dampen the mood in the tourism industry for a few short years .
if the world tourism barometer is right , 2004 will continue the upwards trend of 2003 , the first recovery year following the sept .
11 attacks . according to the madrid-based poll , which consults experts in 100 different countries , the industry 's sales have increased from $ 474 billion -lrb- € 384 billion -rrb- to $ 514 billion from 2002-2003 . the news is encouraging for a business that aims to be one of the 21st century 's key industries . pushed on by a prosperous world economy , experts estimated that there will be around 1.6 billion tourists by 2020 , more than double the number in 2003 . most will continue to head to spain , italy , france and the us , which remain among the most popular destinations , followed by china , britain , austria , mexico , germany and canada .
but southeast asia , presently the choice destination of backpacking youth , is experiencing a sharp upwards trend . destination me the type of vacations people take is already changing .
terrorism fears have led travelers to find vacation spots closer to home , involving less travel time .
the trend towards spending vacations in your backyard , a hit in germany in 2001 and 2002 , seems to be subsiding a bit , but will remain popular , according to the future institute , located in hamburg . vacations will also likely become more personalized in the future .
tourism companies selling package tours plan to allow their clients to " build " their own vacation , rather than offer a one size fits all option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healing the mind and body , on vacation " destination me " vacations are built around the health craze in the western world .
less important than the actual location is the activities the tourist will be doing there - yoga , meditation , etc . those that do n't want to work on their bodies but want to heal their hearts can select travel group vacations designed to bring together those in similar situations -lrb- like new divorcees -rrb- , according to the institute . whatever travel packages future tourists choose , industry experts say the main thing remains that they continue to travel .
up to one-fifth of europe 's combined gross domestic product depends on tourism .
worldwide , tourism has long replaced cars as the biggest export , according to the imf .
even the threat of terrorism has n't been able to change that . kay alexander-scholz -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more space poolside as germans stay home despite the discomfort it 's causing , the hot summer has been embraced by tourists who are flocking back to resorts after last year 's lull .

the report revealed that the algerian has applied for a visa to join his family in germany , which had been agreed by the foreign ministry office in schleswig-holstein . questions raised but algerian remained it showed that while there were judicial questions over the granting of the visa in november last year , the algerian had already been granted permission to enter germany .
the state ministry in kiel was quoted as saying that , while sofiane yacine f. is merely under suspicion of being a terrorist , he is allowed to walk free . after the broadcast , the federal foreign ministry confirmed that , although algerian 's name cropped up on the revised edition of the eu 's list of 50 suspected terrorists and organizations on may 17 this year , he still continues to live freely in schleswig-holstein .
it added that since the revelation came to light , a lawsuit to reverse the visa decision has been put before the administrative court in berlin . bosbach challenges government the conservative opposition faction 's number two wolfgang bosbach has demanded that the social democrat government investigate how the visa was allowed to be issued to a suspected terrorist and for stringent regulations to be put in place to ensure such a mistake does n't happen again .
the federal government must demonstrate " that it wants to close this security gap , " said bosbach in tuesday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
" to reduce the risks , we need a visas-warning file .

about 60 years ago , the situation was strikingly different .
on feb .
13 , 1945 the baroque city center - one of germany 's architectural jewels - was completely destroyed when the allies flew a devastating bombing attack killing more than 10,000 citizens and turning the city into a synonym for apocalyptic destruction .
in the years following the war , dresden struggled to recover its old splendor , but 40 years under communist rule left their mark .
after unification in 1990 the city was nearly restored when the next fatal disaster struck in 2002 : the century 's worst floods raged through the historic downtown , causing immense damage to the city and throwing renovation work back several years .
today dresden is back on its feet and more than completely restored .
throughout its turbulent and inimitable history , the city referred to as the " florence on the elbe , " has withstood destruction and catastrophe to produce a unique combination of historical and modern features like the rebuilt frauenkirche or the semper opera and high-tech enterprises or glass-encrusted automobile works .
dw-world has put together a collection of stories about this remarkable city . dw-world.de stone by stone a significant masterpiece of european architecture , the dresden frauenkirche , is being rebuilt after heavy allied bombing destroyed the cathedral during world war ii .

zebari said he himself had campaigned against the death penalty although he said the situation on the ground in iraq might call for its reinstatement .
" there is a need for the new government to be more decisive and tougher in its actions to bring the security situation under control , " he said .
" we need a deterrence against those elements .
iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi had intended to travel to brussels at the invitation of the eu 's dutch presidency .

ulrich küchl , the seminary director , has already resigned and his deputy , wolfgang rothe , was quoted by the magazine as saying he would also resign , without admitting any guilt .
profil said both küchl and rothe had homosexual relations with students , using pedophile photos for stimulation . church leaders call for bishop to go both men are said to be close to the bishop of sankt pölten , kurt krenn , who said a picture showing rothe kissing a young seminarian had " absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality " , and was merely the kind of " idiocy " boys get up to .
austrian radio reports have revealed that senior church figures were on the point of petitioning the vatican to remove bishop krenn . gay relations between consenting adults is not illegal in austria , but a church official said the seminary directors might have abused their positions to put pressure on students .
the magazine wrote that it is the most serious scandal in the austrian catholic church since cardinal hans hermann groer was forced to resign in 1995 over allegations of pedophilia . the revelations come hard on the heels of more cases of alleged abuse coming to light in the united states and a report by the roman catholic church in england and wales that shows that 52 priests and church workers were accused of sexual abuse against children last year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .

although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .

italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .

they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .

the first students are graduating . on the main market square in pirna , a town of 40,000 near dresden , a group of students are sketching the renaissance gate of their boarding school .
their teacher , dagmar jäger , is teaching them about light and shadow , perspective and depth as any art teacher will .
she does it , however , not in german but in czech , the language of the country next door . the students at the friedrich schiller gymnasium , a secondary school for students who want to go on to get a university degree , learn about art in czech , for instance , but get their music history and theory in the language of the school 's namesake , in german . " there are a few complications , but it works out ok .
you can make yourself understood , " said german student simon hegewald .
" you use a few hand signals and it 's fine . " " or the germans help help us out , " added jana metkova from the czech republic .
" if we do n't understand something , we ask the germans and they translate or explain it somehow . " four years ago , the school began its binational german-czech project , a school aimed at building bridges between the two neighbors whose wounds from world war two are still too raw in some quarters .
in the program , students learn each other 's language and about each other 's cultures , not to mention math , science and art .
in addition to getting a diploma from the state of saxony , czech students get a degree recognized by the czech republic .
every class since 1998 has had 15 german and 15 czech students . while most of the german students commute to classes daily from their parents ' homes , the czech students live at the school and go home only on the weekends . " at first i did n't want to go to germany because i was afraid i would n't understand anything , " said metkova .
" but then my parents told me it would be good .
so i thought about it and then said yes . " challenging four years bernd wenzel is one of those quiet types who works hard but does n't trumpet it .
although in reality he is the driving force behind the success of the school , he says the school was almost forced into existence , since pirna lies so close to the czech border .
he is proud of what the school has accomplished in the past four years , even if it 's been a lot of hard work . " i 'll say this , a boarding school and binational instruction , that adds a completely new dimension to things , " he said .
" it is an immense workload in a very short period of time . " teacher petra pastevera , from olemuc in the czech republic , has been at the school for two years .
she came to germany to teach at a binational school driven by her idealistic views of bridging the gulf that separates the two countries and putting niggling old animosities to rest .
but she has been somewhat disappointed , however , since according to her , most of the students have come simply to improve their job prospects .
they do n't see the pirna school as anything special , she said . " they do n't appreciate the fact that they 're here in germany and could gain so much from their time here , " she added .
" they also do n't leave the school to make contacts .
they just see the whole thing as a necessary evil .

about 60 years ago , the situation was strikingly different .
on feb .
13 , 1945 the baroque city center - one of germany 's architectural jewels - was completely destroyed when the allies flew a devastating bombing attack killing more than 10,000 citizens and turning the city into a synonym for apocalyptic destruction .
in the years following the war , dresden struggled to recover its old splendor , but 40 years under communist rule left their mark .
after unification in 1990 the city was nearly restored when the next fatal disaster struck in 2002 : the century 's worst floods raged through the historic downtown , causing immense damage to the city and throwing renovation work back several years .
today dresden is back on its feet and more than completely restored .
throughout its turbulent and inimitable history , the city referred to as the " florence on the elbe , " has withstood destruction and catastrophe to produce a unique combination of historical and modern features like the rebuilt frauenkirche or the semper opera and high-tech enterprises or glass-encrusted automobile works .
dw-world has put together a collection of stories about this remarkable city . dw-world.de stone by stone a significant masterpiece of european architecture , the dresden frauenkirche , is being rebuilt after heavy allied bombing destroyed the cathedral during world war ii .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .
later this year the eu executive is expected to propose reforms to make the guidelines more flexible . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes court ruling berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules .

" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .

meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .
right now solar collectors in china produce as much energy as three nuclear power plants .
germany is seeking to support solar power development in china over the long term . erik campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pursues better business ties to india though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin .

ulrich küchl , the seminary director , has already resigned and his deputy , wolfgang rothe , was quoted by the magazine as saying he would also resign , without admitting any guilt .
profil said both küchl and rothe had homosexual relations with students , using pedophile photos for stimulation . church leaders call for bishop to go both men are said to be close to the bishop of sankt pölten , kurt krenn , who said a picture showing rothe kissing a young seminarian had " absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality " , and was merely the kind of " idiocy " boys get up to .
austrian radio reports have revealed that senior church figures were on the point of petitioning the vatican to remove bishop krenn . gay relations between consenting adults is not illegal in austria , but a church official said the seminary directors might have abused their positions to put pressure on students .
the magazine wrote that it is the most serious scandal in the austrian catholic church since cardinal hans hermann groer was forced to resign in 1995 over allegations of pedophilia . the revelations come hard on the heels of more cases of alleged abuse coming to light in the united states and a report by the roman catholic church in england and wales that shows that 52 priests and church workers were accused of sexual abuse against children last year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .

the report revealed that the algerian has applied for a visa to join his family in germany , which had been agreed by the foreign ministry office in schleswig-holstein . questions raised but algerian remained it showed that while there were judicial questions over the granting of the visa in november last year , the algerian had already been granted permission to enter germany .
the state ministry in kiel was quoted as saying that , while sofiane yacine f. is merely under suspicion of being a terrorist , he is allowed to walk free . after the broadcast , the federal foreign ministry confirmed that , although algerian 's name cropped up on the revised edition of the eu 's list of 50 suspected terrorists and organizations on may 17 this year , he still continues to live freely in schleswig-holstein .
it added that since the revelation came to light , a lawsuit to reverse the visa decision has been put before the administrative court in berlin . bosbach challenges government the conservative opposition faction 's number two wolfgang bosbach has demanded that the social democrat government investigate how the visa was allowed to be issued to a suspected terrorist and for stringent regulations to be put in place to ensure such a mistake does n't happen again .
the federal government must demonstrate " that it wants to close this security gap , " said bosbach in tuesday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
" to reduce the risks , we need a visas-warning file .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 court annulls eu stability pact suspension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ruling a red flag for the german finance minister ?
the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .
later this year the eu executive is expected to propose reforms to make the guidelines more flexible . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes court ruling berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.07.2004 german-czech school aims to build bridges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students learn in both czech and german in 1998 , a secondary school near the czech-german border embarked on a project to educate german and czech students together in order to increase understanding between the countries .
the first students are graduating . on the main market square in pirna , a town of 40,000 near dresden , a group of students are sketching the renaissance gate of their boarding school .
their teacher , dagmar jäger , is teaching them about light and shadow , perspective and depth as any art teacher will .
she does it , however , not in german but in czech , the language of the country next door . the students at the friedrich schiller gymnasium , a secondary school for students who want to go on to get a university degree , learn about art in czech , for instance , but get their music history and theory in the language of the school 's namesake , in german . " there are a few complications , but it works out ok .
you can make yourself understood , " said german student simon hegewald .
" you use a few hand signals and it 's fine . " " or the germans help help us out , " added jana metkova from the czech republic .
" if we do n't understand something , we ask the germans and they translate or explain it somehow . " four years ago , the school began its binational german-czech project , a school aimed at building bridges between the two neighbors whose wounds from world war two are still too raw in some quarters .
in the program , students learn each other 's language and about each other 's cultures , not to mention math , science and art .
in addition to getting a diploma from the state of saxony , czech students get a degree recognized by the czech republic .
every class since 1998 has had 15 german and 15 czech students . while most of the german students commute to classes daily from their parents ' homes , the czech students live at the school and go home only on the weekends . " at first i did n't want to go to germany because i was afraid i would n't understand anything , " said metkova .
" but then my parents told me it would be good .
so i thought about it and then said yes . " challenging four years bernd wenzel is one of those quiet types who works hard but does n't trumpet it .
although in reality he is the driving force behind the success of the school , he says the school was almost forced into existence , since pirna lies so close to the czech border .
he is proud of what the school has accomplished in the past four years , even if it 's been a lot of hard work . " i 'll say this , a boarding school and binational instruction , that adds a completely new dimension to things , " he said .
" it is an immense workload in a very short period of time . " teacher petra pastevera , from olemuc in the czech republic , has been at the school for two years .
she came to germany to teach at a binational school driven by her idealistic views of bridging the gulf that separates the two countries and putting niggling old animosities to rest .
but she has been somewhat disappointed , however , since according to her , most of the students have come simply to improve their job prospects .
they do n't see the pirna school as anything special , she said . " they do n't appreciate the fact that they 're here in germany and could gain so much from their time here , " she added .
" they also do n't leave the school to make contacts .
they just see the whole thing as a necessary evil .

experts anticipate a steadily growing industry that will be among the most important in the world in a few decades . the threat of terrorism was only able to dampen the mood in the tourism industry for a few short years .
if the world tourism barometer is right , 2004 will continue the upwards trend of 2003 , the first recovery year following the sept .

up to one-fifth of europe 's combined gross domestic product depends on tourism .
worldwide , tourism has long replaced cars as the biggest export , according to the imf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 berlin , rome spar over refugee ship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after three weeks at sea , african refugees disembark in sicily .
the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .

meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .

about 60 years ago , the situation was strikingly different .
on feb .
13 , 1945 the baroque city center - one of germany 's architectural jewels - was completely destroyed when the allies flew a devastating bombing attack killing more than 10,000 citizens and turning the city into a synonym for apocalyptic destruction .
in the years following the war , dresden struggled to recover its old splendor , but 40 years under communist rule left their mark .
after unification in 1990 the city was nearly restored when the next fatal disaster struck in 2002 : the century 's worst floods raged through the historic downtown , causing immense damage to the city and throwing renovation work back several years .
today dresden is back on its feet and more than completely restored .
throughout its turbulent and inimitable history , the city referred to as the " florence on the elbe , " has withstood destruction and catastrophe to produce a unique combination of historical and modern features like the rebuilt frauenkirche or the semper opera and high-tech enterprises or glass-encrusted automobile works .
dw-world has put together a collection of stories about this remarkable city . dw-world.de stone by stone a significant masterpiece of european architecture , the dresden frauenkirche , is being rebuilt after heavy allied bombing destroyed the cathedral during world war ii .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .

european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .

13 , 1945 the baroque city center - one of germany 's architectural jewels - was completely destroyed when the allies flew a devastating bombing attack killing more than 10,000 citizens and turning the city into a synonym for apocalyptic destruction .
in the years following the war , dresden struggled to recover its old splendor , but 40 years under communist rule left their mark .
after unification in 1990 the city was nearly restored when the next fatal disaster struck in 2002 : the century 's worst floods raged through the historic downtown , causing immense damage to the city and throwing renovation work back several years .
today dresden is back on its feet and more than completely restored .
throughout its turbulent and inimitable history , the city referred to as the " florence on the elbe , " has withstood destruction and catastrophe to produce a unique combination of historical and modern features like the rebuilt frauenkirche or the semper opera and high-tech enterprises or glass-encrusted automobile works .

it affirms the legality of the decision by the council of ministers on nov .

in the ruling , which annulled the decision by the council of finance ministers to suspend disciplinary sanctions against germany and france for violating the stability pact 's budget deficit ceiling of three percent , the court also noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the ministers .
" there is no automatism in the deficit procedures , " müller said interpreting the court 's verdict .
" in fact , the council has room to make decisions and the council made use of that room for maneuver . "
he said the court 's decision was also a " clear signal to the council of ministers and the eu commission to cooperate in issues regarding the application of the stability and growth pact .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .
from germany to italy to malta , nobody wants to get their fingers burnt .
nobody wants to set a precedent .
that 's why we need a centralized european asylum policy .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .

while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .

an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .

instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .
right now solar collectors in china produce as much energy as three nuclear power plants .
germany is seeking to support solar power development in china over the long term . erik campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pursues better business ties to india though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin .

the report revealed that the algerian has applied for a visa to join his family in germany , which had been agreed by the foreign ministry office in schleswig-holstein . questions raised but algerian remained it showed that while there were judicial questions over the granting of the visa in november last year , the algerian had already been granted permission to enter germany .
the state ministry in kiel was quoted as saying that , while sofiane yacine f. is merely under suspicion of being a terrorist , he is allowed to walk free . after the broadcast , the federal foreign ministry confirmed that , although algerian 's name cropped up on the revised edition of the eu 's list of 50 suspected terrorists and organizations on may 17 this year , he still continues to live freely in schleswig-holstein .
it added that since the revelation came to light , a lawsuit to reverse the visa decision has been put before the administrative court in berlin . bosbach challenges government the conservative opposition faction 's number two wolfgang bosbach has demanded that the social democrat government investigate how the visa was allowed to be issued to a suspected terrorist and for stringent regulations to be put in place to ensure such a mistake does n't happen again .
the federal government must demonstrate " that it wants to close this security gap , " said bosbach in tuesday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
" to reduce the risks , we need a visas-warning file . " bosbach added that the granting of the visa was " incomprehensible " and " irresponsible " in light of the current climate regarding international terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily plays down tip on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2004 german foreign minister heads to asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first stop : india joschka fischer is gearing up for a 10-day tour of asia .
meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .
right now solar collectors in china produce as much energy as three nuclear power plants .
germany is seeking to support solar power development in china over the long term . erik campano -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pursues better business ties to india though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin .

polish finance minister andrzej raczko told journalists that harmonization is necessary for business to run in poland , germany and france , adding , harmonization " is an issue poland also should be interested in . "
this will add pressure on countries like estonia , as it breaks the conception that the issue was germany and france versus the new eu members .
it was estonia that came directly into the firing line of french finance minister nicolas sarkozy who pressed the link between assistance and tax rates .
" i am thinking of our estonian friends who have put their tax rate at zero , " he said .
" how can you ask for lots of structural funds and have a fiscal policy at zero .
who can understand that ? "
the 10 new eu member states generally have very low levels of corporate tax in order to make their economies more attractive for company investment .
estonia has a zero percent rate for reinvested earnings while latvia , lithuania and cyprus level tax at 15 percent and poland at 19 percent .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .

ulrich küchl , the seminary director , has already resigned and his deputy , wolfgang rothe , was quoted by the magazine as saying he would also resign , without admitting any guilt .
profil said both küchl and rothe had homosexual relations with students , using pedophile photos for stimulation . church leaders call for bishop to go both men are said to be close to the bishop of sankt pölten , kurt krenn , who said a picture showing rothe kissing a young seminarian had " absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality " , and was merely the kind of " idiocy " boys get up to .
austrian radio reports have revealed that senior church figures were on the point of petitioning the vatican to remove bishop krenn . gay relations between consenting adults is not illegal in austria , but a church official said the seminary directors might have abused their positions to put pressure on students .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .

polish finance minister andrzej raczko told journalists that harmonization is necessary for business to run in poland , germany and france , adding , harmonization " is an issue poland also should be interested in . "
this will add pressure on countries like estonia , as it breaks the conception that the issue was germany and france versus the new eu members .
it was estonia that came directly into the firing line of french finance minister nicolas sarkozy who pressed the link between assistance and tax rates .
" i am thinking of our estonian friends who have put their tax rate at zero , " he said .
" how can you ask for lots of structural funds and have a fiscal policy at zero .
who can understand that ? "
the 10 new eu member states generally have very low levels of corporate tax in order to make their economies more attractive for company investment .
estonia has a zero percent rate for reinvested earnings while latvia , lithuania and cyprus level tax at 15 percent and poland at 19 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 court annulls eu stability pact suspension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ruling a red flag for the german finance minister ?
the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .
later this year the eu executive is expected to propose reforms to make the guidelines more flexible . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes court ruling berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 -pipe- 08:00 utc pressure for common tax base continues according to afp , the finance ministers of france , germany and poland discussed the linkage during a meeting on monday , and it appears that poland has now given its tacit backing .
polish finance minister andrzej raczko told journalists that harmonization is necessary for business to run in poland , germany and france , adding , harmonization " is an issue poland also should be interested in . "
this will add pressure on countries like estonia , as it breaks the conception that the issue was germany and france versus the new eu members .
it was estonia that came directly into the firing line of french finance minister nicolas sarkozy who pressed the link between assistance and tax rates .
" i am thinking of our estonian friends who have put their tax rate at zero , " he said .
" how can you ask for lots of structural funds and have a fiscal policy at zero .
who can understand that ? "

the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany . a november 2003 decision by the council , ignoring a previous european commission recommendation to punish the two countries for failing to reduce public deficits , had driven a wedge into the eu 's stability and growth pact .
it also set up a precedent whereby the commission sought legal action against eu governments for violating their own accepted guidelines .
" the council can not depart from the rules laid down by the treaty or those which it set for itself in regulation no. 1467/97 , " the court said in its statement tuesday annulling the council 's conclusions from nov .
25 .
european commissioners had advised that more stringent budgetary measures be brought against france and germany after their public deficits repeatedly breached the stability pact 's ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product .
but a council of eu finance ministers decided not to press for a strict application of rules , ironically designed at germany 's behest to underpin the eu 's single currency .
a clutch of member states that have worked hard to remedy their own finances - austria , the netherlands , finland and spain - had voted against the council 's decision , arguing that letting berlin and paris off the hook would sound the death knell for the rules .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm , one the fiercest advocates of budgetary discipline , said after he and fellow ministers were overruled : " the pact is not dead but it 's in the refrigerator . "
victory for commission the court 's verdict represents a tactical victory for the european commission , the eu 's brussels-based executive office , which had feared that its authority would be undermined if the council of ministers was allowed to bypass the commission and set its own agenda without reprimands .
the court in luxembourg noted that " responsibility for making the member states observe budgetary discipline lies essentially " with the council of ministers from the eu governments .
but it said once a disciplinary procedure has been implemented and the ministers have adopted recommendations for a country to correct its deficit problem , the ministers " can not modify them without being prompted again by the commission , which has a right of initiative . "
only a reprieve for germany a france eu finance ministers had granted germany and france , which together make up roughly half of the euro zone 's economic output , a reprieve from sanctions in return for promises to bring their budgets back in line with the stability pact by 2005 , a condition both accepted .
german and french ministers had argued that additional budget cuts or tax hikes as proposed by the commission would only worsen their dire economic straits and that the idea behind the stability pact should not be to cripple a member state 's economy .
following the court 's ruling , excessive deficit procedures may now be restarted against germany and france but they need not fear fines , the ultimate sanction in the budget disciplinary procedure which may now have to be restarted .
the stability pact itself has repeatedly come under question and even in the commission the rule have met with criticism .
later this year the eu executive is expected to propose reforms to make the guidelines more flexible . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes court ruling berlin applauded the european court of justice 's ruling on the eu 's stability and growth pact , saying the verdict gives euro zone governments room for interpreting the eu 's strict set of budget rules .

today , however , his nomination has come to the crunch as meps flex their political muscles and test his credentials .
first up are the socialists who are reportedly very split on his suitability .
they are set to question him on his tough economic policies as he forced his country to tighten its belt and adhere to the rules of the stability pact .
they are also likely to question him on his support for the iraq war .
their hostility on this issue will be shared by the greens who will be grilling barroso later on tuesday .
a general complaint , which these hearings may put to rights , is that the portuguese is an unknown on the european stage ; no one is quite sure how he stands on european issues .
on wednesday , barroso will be given a hearing by the largest group in the parliament - the centre-right epp .
however , this group is generally well-disposed to him because he comes from their political ranks .
the european parliament as a whole will vote on barroso on 22 july in a secret ballot .
barroso needs to get a simple majority in the 732-seat parliament .
if the socialists and the centre-right were to vote in favour of him , they would account for 470 votes .
if he is supported by parliament next week , mr barroso will take up the post as commission president in november .
as president , he will oversee the brussels executive which proposes eu laws and ensures that member states implement them .

meeting with leaders from india , bangladesh , sri lanka , china and pakistan , the german minister intends to discuss questions of security and reform of the un . for the next week and a half germany 's foreign minister will put aside the controversial issues he 's been facing in europe , namely the question of the eu constitution and support for rebuilding iraq .
while on a tour of several asian countries , fischer will make every effort to give his state visit a positive spin and bolster german ties with the region .
the foreign minister 's spokesperson , walter lindner , told reporters that fischer will focus on regional stability in south and east asia , and cooperation between international organizations as well as gaining support for proposed reforms of the united nations .
garnering support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the u.n. security council is on top of fischer 's agenda .
right now there are five members with veto rights , reflecting a power dynamic that was set in place after world war ii : china , france , great britain , russia and the united states .
proposals are already on the table for revamping the council 's composition , and germany is spearheading the initiative , which could also include a permanent seat for japan and india .
first stop : new delhi the first station on fischer 's 10-day trip is the indian capital and he will stop there again towards the end of the trip , according to german foreign ministry officials .
recent tensions between india and neighboring pakistan -lrb- fischer 's last stop -rrb- have died down somewhat , but the issue of regional stability still figures high on the german minister 's list of topics .
both countries are nuclear powers and fischer is intent on discussing ways to help the two rivals diffuse the conflict over the kashmir border region .
former german president johannes rau visited india in march last year , helping to boost bilateral ties immensely .
between india and pakistan , fischer will squeeze in visits to sri lanka and bangladesh .
fischer is primarily interested in helping reinvigorate stalled peace talks between the sri lanka government and tamil rebels .
in bangladesh he will be the first high-ranking german official to visit the country in almost 20 years .
an entourage of fifteen businessmen will accompany the foreign minister and talks will center on improving trade relations in the impoverished region .
the green minister fischer will also stop in beijing .
he has already met the chinese foreign minister on several occasions .
as trade has been booming between the two countries , with german companies investing heavily in china , fischer is likely to avoid sensitive issues such as the question of human rights .
instead , the minister 's spokesperson said fischer - a member of the greens party - will probably concentrate on ways the two countries can work together to create environmentally sustainable forms of energy .
as china 's economy continues to boom , oil and other natural resources are being consumed at an increasing rate .
for the world 's most populous country , a constant and reliable energy source is becoming more and more important .
fischer hopes alternative sources such as solar power may satisfy the growing need .
in the province of shangdong he will unveil the world 's largest solar collector facility - a joint german-chinese initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.07.2004 german-czech school aims to build bridges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students learn in both czech and german in 1998 , a secondary school near the czech-german border embarked on a project to educate german and czech students together in order to increase understanding between the countries .
the first students are graduating . on the main market square in pirna , a town of 40,000 near dresden , a group of students are sketching the renaissance gate of their boarding school .
their teacher , dagmar jäger , is teaching them about light and shadow , perspective and depth as any art teacher will .
she does it , however , not in german but in czech , the language of the country next door . the students at the friedrich schiller gymnasium , a secondary school for students who want to go on to get a university degree , learn about art in czech , for instance , but get their music history and theory in the language of the school 's namesake , in german . " there are a few complications , but it works out ok .
you can make yourself understood , " said german student simon hegewald .
" you use a few hand signals and it 's fine . " " or the germans help help us out , " added jana metkova from the czech republic .
" if we do n't understand something , we ask the germans and they translate or explain it somehow . " four years ago , the school began its binational german-czech project , a school aimed at building bridges between the two neighbors whose wounds from world war two are still too raw in some quarters .
in the program , students learn each other 's language and about each other 's cultures , not to mention math , science and art .
in addition to getting a diploma from the state of saxony , czech students get a degree recognized by the czech republic .
every class since 1998 has had 15 german and 15 czech students . while most of the german students commute to classes daily from their parents ' homes , the czech students live at the school and go home only on the weekends . " at first i did n't want to go to germany because i was afraid i would n't understand anything , " said metkova .
" but then my parents told me it would be good .
so i thought about it and then said yes . " challenging four years bernd wenzel is one of those quiet types who works hard but does n't trumpet it .
although in reality he is the driving force behind the success of the school , he says the school was almost forced into existence , since pirna lies so close to the czech border .
he is proud of what the school has accomplished in the past four years , even if it 's been a lot of hard work . " i 'll say this , a boarding school and binational instruction , that adds a completely new dimension to things , " he said .
" it is an immense workload in a very short period of time . " teacher petra pastevera , from olemuc in the czech republic , has been at the school for two years .
she came to germany to teach at a binational school driven by her idealistic views of bridging the gulf that separates the two countries and putting niggling old animosities to rest .
but she has been somewhat disappointed , however , since according to her , most of the students have come simply to improve their job prospects .
they do n't see the pirna school as anything special , she said . " they do n't appreciate the fact that they 're here in germany and could gain so much from their time here , " she added .
" they also do n't leave the school to make contacts .
they just see the whole thing as a necessary evil .

ulrich küchl , the seminary director , has already resigned and his deputy , wolfgang rothe , was quoted by the magazine as saying he would also resign , without admitting any guilt .
profil said both küchl and rothe had homosexual relations with students , using pedophile photos for stimulation . church leaders call for bishop to go both men are said to be close to the bishop of sankt pölten , kurt krenn , who said a picture showing rothe kissing a young seminarian had " absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality " , and was merely the kind of " idiocy " boys get up to .
austrian radio reports have revealed that senior church figures were on the point of petitioning the vatican to remove bishop krenn . gay relations between consenting adults is not illegal in austria , but a church official said the seminary directors might have abused their positions to put pressure on students .
the magazine wrote that it is the most serious scandal in the austrian catholic church since cardinal hans hermann groer was forced to resign in 1995 over allegations of pedophilia . the revelations come hard on the heels of more cases of alleged abuse coming to light in the united states and a report by the roman catholic church in england and wales that shows that 52 priests and church workers were accused of sexual abuse against children last year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .

police said the 23-year old appeared to be the man seen on footage from a video surveillance camera pushing a bicycle toward the scene shortly before the nail bomb exploded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2004 -pipe- 08:00 utc barroso faces tough questions by meps nominated to be european commission president by eu leaders last month , barroso shot from relative obscurity as portuguese leader into the brussels limelight .
today , however , his nomination has come to the crunch as meps flex their political muscles and test his credentials .
first up are the socialists who are reportedly very split on his suitability .
they are set to question him on his tough economic policies as he forced his country to tighten its belt and adhere to the rules of the stability pact .
they are also likely to question him on his support for the iraq war .
their hostility on this issue will be shared by the greens who will be grilling barroso later on tuesday .
a general complaint , which these hearings may put to rights , is that the portuguese is an unknown on the european stage ; no one is quite sure how he stands on european issues .
on wednesday , barroso will be given a hearing by the largest group in the parliament - the centre-right epp .
however , this group is generally well-disposed to him because he comes from their political ranks .
the european parliament as a whole will vote on barroso on 22 july in a secret ballot .
barroso needs to get a simple majority in the 732-seat parliament .
if the socialists and the centre-right were to vote in favour of him , they would account for 470 votes .
if he is supported by parliament next week , mr barroso will take up the post as commission president in november .
as president , he will oversee the brussels executive which proposes eu laws and ensures that member states implement them .

today , however , his nomination has come to the crunch as meps flex their political muscles and test his credentials .
first up are the socialists who are reportedly very split on his suitability .
they are set to question him on his tough economic policies as he forced his country to tighten its belt and adhere to the rules of the stability pact .
they are also likely to question him on his support for the iraq war .
their hostility on this issue will be shared by the greens who will be grilling barroso later on tuesday .
a general complaint , which these hearings may put to rights , is that the portuguese is an unknown on the european stage ; no one is quite sure how he stands on european issues .
on wednesday , barroso will be given a hearing by the largest group in the parliament - the centre-right epp .
however , this group is generally well-disposed to him because he comes from their political ranks .

the report revealed that the algerian has applied for a visa to join his family in germany , which had been agreed by the foreign ministry office in schleswig-holstein . questions raised but algerian remained it showed that while there were judicial questions over the granting of the visa in november last year , the algerian had already been granted permission to enter germany .
the state ministry in kiel was quoted as saying that , while sofiane yacine f. is merely under suspicion of being a terrorist , he is allowed to walk free . after the broadcast , the federal foreign ministry confirmed that , although algerian 's name cropped up on the revised edition of the eu 's list of 50 suspected terrorists and organizations on may 17 this year , he still continues to live freely in schleswig-holstein .
it added that since the revelation came to light , a lawsuit to reverse the visa decision has been put before the administrative court in berlin . bosbach challenges government the conservative opposition faction 's number two wolfgang bosbach has demanded that the social democrat government investigate how the visa was allowed to be issued to a suspected terrorist and for stringent regulations to be put in place to ensure such a mistake does n't happen again .
the federal government must demonstrate " that it wants to close this security gap , " said bosbach in tuesday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
" to reduce the risks , we need a visas-warning file . " bosbach added that the granting of the visa was " incomprehensible " and " irresponsible " in light of the current climate regarding international terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily plays down tip on sept .

polish finance minister andrzej raczko told journalists that harmonization is necessary for business to run in poland , germany and france , adding , harmonization " is an issue poland also should be interested in . "
this will add pressure on countries like estonia , as it breaks the conception that the issue was germany and france versus the new eu members .
it was estonia that came directly into the firing line of french finance minister nicolas sarkozy who pressed the link between assistance and tax rates .
" i am thinking of our estonian friends who have put their tax rate at zero , " he said .
" how can you ask for lots of structural funds and have a fiscal policy at zero .
who can understand that ? "

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .
from germany to italy to malta , nobody wants to get their fingers burnt .
nobody wants to set a precedent .
that 's why we need a centralized european asylum policy .

italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .

they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .

italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .

the fate of 37 african immigrants now on land in italy after spending weeks on a german relief ship remains uncertain as rome and berlin argue over which country should take them in . the front page headline of a vatican newspaper on tuesday read , " finally , humanity wins . "
but the story is n't quite over yet .
although the group of african refugees plucked out of the mediterranean by the german relief ship cap anamur were finally allowed to disembark and get medical attention , their fate is still up in the air as germany and italy now bicker over eu asylum laws .
complicating the situation , italian police have arrested the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the head of the cap anamur , elias bierdel , for aiding and abetting illegal immigration .
italian interior ministry officials blasted what they called the " pack of lies " told by the german humanitarian organization , which they claim forced rome to cave in under pressure from the international media and the vatican .
" the cap anamur took the illegal immigrants on board with the precise aim of bringing them to italy by telling a pack of lies , " italian officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police stand guard over the harbor in porto empedocle in southern sicily as the cap anamur approaches .
they said the government only allowed the boat to dock in porto empedocle in southern sicily after schmidt warned of unrest and suffering among the refugees , some of whom had reportedly threatened to throw themselves overboard .
odyssey of inhumanity german officials meanwhile have called for the release of schmidt and bierdel and voiced pride that a german had worked to end the " odyssey of inhumanity " that has pushed the refugee issue back into european headlines .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul hailed bierdel 's " courage and desire to help others . "
she insisted " humanitarian actions must not be criminalized . "
berlin 's representative for human rights , claudia roth , said she " felt a sort of pride that it was a german ship , that it was this organization that saved human lives . "
she condemned the three-week stand-off that occurred while italy , malta , germany and the aid organization argued over who was responsible for the 37 africans .
" we must promise to take a fair look into their right to asylum , " roth said in a german radio interview .
question of asylum status but germany and italy have both said the refugees are ineligible for refugee status in their country .
on monday a spokesman for the interior ministry in berlin said the africans could not come to germany since eu laws stipulated that asylum is to be granted in the first country of port .
before docking in sicily , it was reported that the refugees , who were believed to come from the war-torn darfur region in sudan , had achieved german asylum .
this is not the case , the german ministry said .
moreover , it appears the africans are not actually from sudan , but rather from ghana and nigeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 37 africans , mostly from nigeria and ghana , will wait in holding center for illegal immigrants until their fate can be decided .
italy has rejected granting asylum because it claims the ship passed through maltese waters before setting sail to sicily .
malta for its part says no one told them the 37 africans were on board or asked for assistance .
a european-wide problem italy , which often serves as the gateway to europe for african refugees , is particularly sensitive about the issue of asylum .
on monday , the president of the italian refugee council , dr. christop hein , said the situation illustrated the need for the creation of a centralized eu asylum policy .
" for five years we have been talking about a european union wide asylum policy .
what has happened here is quite disturbing .
nobody wants to take the responsibility and everybody is passing the buck in this case .
from germany to italy to malta , nobody wants to get their fingers burnt .
nobody wants to set a precedent .
that 's why we need a centralized european asylum policy .

on feb .
13 , 1945 the baroque city center - one of germany 's architectural jewels - was completely destroyed when the allies flew a devastating bombing attack killing more than 10,000 citizens and turning the city into a synonym for apocalyptic destruction .

after unification in 1990 the city was nearly restored when the next fatal disaster struck in 2002 : the century 's worst floods raged through the historic downtown , causing immense damage to the city and throwing renovation work back several years .
today dresden is back on its feet and more than completely restored .
throughout its turbulent and inimitable history , the city referred to as the " florence on the elbe , " has withstood destruction and catastrophe to produce a unique combination of historical and modern features like the rebuilt frauenkirche or the semper opera and high-tech enterprises or glass-encrusted automobile works .

environmentally friendly substitutes for petrol and diesel , long championed by green campaigners , have been commercially available for years .
but their high price relative to fossil fuels , along with the expense and inconvenience of adapting cars to run on them , has so far prevented them from penetrating the mass market .
now , there are signs that a surge of entrepreneurial activity in the alternative fuels sector , coupled with rising oil prices and ever more strident warnings over climate change , could be about to change all that .
market debut the most striking measure of the new mood of confidence sweeping the industry is that , for the first time , alternative fuel companies are listing on the stock market to fund future expansion .
the biofuels corporation , based in teesside , floated on london 's aim market last month , and london-based d1 oils is scheduled to follow suit in september .
we feel we 're here at the right time john nicholas , chief executive , biofuels corporation both firms produce biodiesel , seen as the green fuel most likely to make major inroads into the mainstream market .
biodiesel , currently available at about 100 petrol stations in the uk , is an environmentalist 's dream .
a modified vegetable oil made from crops such as rapeseed , it does not cause climate change since the carbon dioxide generated by burning the fuels is 100 % accounted for by the carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere by the plants it is made from .
moreover , when compared with ordinary diesel , biodiesel generates up to 60 % fewer environmentally harmful , toxic emissions that cause acid rain and smog .
but biodiesel 's biggest advantage over other alternative fuels is that most diesel cars can be easily and cheaply adapted to run on it , without any loss of performance .
cost equation the main challenge for the biodiesel industry now is to produce the fuel cheaply enough to compete head-on with diesel on the garage forecourt .
the industry consists of a fragmented network of small companies , and as a result , production costs - and prices - are high .
in the uk , biodiesel currently costs about four pence more per litre at the pump than regular diesel , despite a 20p per litre tax concession introduced by the government in 2001 .
biodiesel is often produced from rapeseed faced with this price premium , british motorists have voted with their wallets , with sales of biodiesel stalling at a paltry 24 million litres a year , compared with annual petrol and diesel consumption of about 20 billion litres .
the biofuels corporation and d1 oils are leading a concerted push to narrow or eliminate the price gap , hoping to tap into pent-up demand for affordable green fuel .
" the consumer awareness is there , but we need the economics to fall into place , " says d1 oils chief executive mark quinn .
" we 're confident that price is the issue . "
his counterpart at the biofuels corporation , john nicholas , is equally certain that the market is ripe for expansion .
" we 've been looking at this for two years , and we feel we 're here at the right time , " he says .
bigger is cheaper both firms aim to use the proceeds of their stock market floatations to fund efficient , large-scale production facilities , passing on the cost savings to consumers .
there 's plenty of oil around , and biofuels are too expensive malcolm watson , uk petroleum industries association the biofuels corporation is planning to build europe 's biggest biodiesel plant , capable of producing 250,000 tonnes of the fuel every year , at seal sands on teesside .
d1 oils , meanwhile , is planning to supply biodiesel worldwide from plantations of oil-bearing crops - including jatropha , a tropical shrub - covering more than 70,000 hectares in africa and asia .
whether they manage to wean more drivers off the fossil fuel habit remains to be seen .
last month , a report from the uk petroleum industry association -lrb- ukpia -rrb- said the wide availability and comparatively low cost of petrol and diesel would help them see off any challenge from alternative fuels for the foreseeable future .
according to its co-author , ukpia technical director malcolm watson , substantial price reductions would be needed to encourage a significant take-up of biodiesel .
" there 's plenty of oil around , and in the meantime , biofuels are simply too expensive .
they cost two to three times more to produce , " he says .
way forward however , the attempt by biofuels corporation and d1 oils to shake up the alternative fuel market may be helped by wider political and economic developments .
firstly , the european union has urged member states to ensure that 2 % of all transport fuels are derived from renewable sources by 2005 .
the target is not obligatory , and the uk , for one , looks certain to fall far short of it .
but the green fuels industry is nonetheless hopeful that it may persuade some european governments to stimulate biodiesel sales through , for instance , further tax cuts .
green fuels enthusiasts in the uk point to germany , where the biodiesel accounts for a large chunk of the diesel market thanks to a favourable tax regime .
secondly , last month 's surge in oil prices , triggered by soaring global demand and unrest in the middle east , has reminded consumers that fossil fuels are a finite resource whose supply can sometimes be precarious .
while biodiesel producers are not counting on a sustained rise in oil prices to transform the economics of their industry , they say turmoil in the oil market has rekindled interest in alternative fuels .

the biofuels corporation and d1 oils are leading a concerted push to narrow or eliminate the price gap , hoping to tap into pent-up demand for affordable green fuel .
" the consumer awareness is there , but we need the economics to fall into place , " says d1 oils chief executive mark quinn .
" we 're confident that price is the issue . "
his counterpart at the biofuels corporation , john nicholas , is equally certain that the market is ripe for expansion .
" we 've been looking at this for two years , and we feel we 're here at the right time , " he says .
bigger is cheaper both firms aim to use the proceeds of their stock market floatations to fund efficient , large-scale production facilities , passing on the cost savings to consumers .
there 's plenty of oil around , and biofuels are too expensive malcolm watson , uk petroleum industries association the biofuels corporation is planning to build europe 's biggest biodiesel plant , capable of producing 250,000 tonnes of the fuel every year , at seal sands on teesside .
d1 oils , meanwhile , is planning to supply biodiesel worldwide from plantations of oil-bearing crops - including jatropha , a tropical shrub - covering more than 70,000 hectares in africa and asia .
whether they manage to wean more drivers off the fossil fuel habit remains to be seen .
last month , a report from the uk petroleum industry association -lrb- ukpia -rrb- said the wide availability and comparatively low cost of petrol and diesel would help them see off any challenge from alternative fuels for the foreseeable future .
according to its co-author , ukpia technical director malcolm watson , substantial price reductions would be needed to encourage a significant take-up of biodiesel .
" there 's plenty of oil around , and in the meantime , biofuels are simply too expensive .
they cost two to three times more to produce , " he says .
way forward however , the attempt by biofuels corporation and d1 oils to shake up the alternative fuel market may be helped by wider political and economic developments .
firstly , the european union has urged member states to ensure that 2 % of all transport fuels are derived from renewable sources by 2005 .
the target is not obligatory , and the uk , for one , looks certain to fall far short of it .
but the green fuels industry is nonetheless hopeful that it may persuade some european governments to stimulate biodiesel sales through , for instance , further tax cuts .
green fuels enthusiasts in the uk point to germany , where the biodiesel accounts for a large chunk of the diesel market thanks to a favourable tax regime .
secondly , last month 's surge in oil prices , triggered by soaring global demand and unrest in the middle east , has reminded consumers that fossil fuels are a finite resource whose supply can sometimes be precarious .
while biodiesel producers are not counting on a sustained rise in oil prices to transform the economics of their industry , they say turmoil in the oil market has rekindled interest in alternative fuels .

environmentally friendly substitutes for petrol and diesel , long championed by green campaigners , have been commercially available for years .
but their high price relative to fossil fuels , along with the expense and inconvenience of adapting cars to run on them , has so far prevented them from penetrating the mass market .
now , there are signs that a surge of entrepreneurial activity in the alternative fuels sector , coupled with rising oil prices and ever more strident warnings over climate change , could be about to change all that .
market debut the most striking measure of the new mood of confidence sweeping the industry is that , for the first time , alternative fuel companies are listing on the stock market to fund future expansion .
the biofuels corporation , based in teesside , floated on london 's aim market last month , and london-based d1 oils is scheduled to follow suit in september . "
we feel we 're here at the right time " john nicholas , chief executive , biofuels corporation both firms produce biodiesel , seen as the green fuel most likely to make major inroads into the mainstream market .
biodiesel , currently available at about 100 petrol stations in the uk , is an environmentalist 's dream .
a modified vegetable oil made from crops such as rapeseed , it does not cause climate change since the carbon dioxide generated by burning the fuels is 100 % accounted for by the carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere by the plants it is made from .
moreover , when compared with ordinary diesel , biodiesel generates up to 60 % fewer environmentally harmful , toxic emissions that cause acid rain and smog .
but biodiesel 's biggest advantage over other alternative fuels is that most diesel cars can be easily and cheaply adapted to run on it , without any loss of performance .
cost equation the main challenge for the biodiesel industry now is to produce the fuel cheaply enough to compete head-on with diesel on the garage forecourt .
the industry consists of a fragmented network of small companies , and as a result , production costs - and prices - are high .
in the uk , biodiesel currently costs about four pence more per litre at the pump than regular diesel , despite a 20p per litre tax concession introduced by the government in 2001 .
faced with this price premium , british motorists have voted with their wallets , with sales of biodiesel stalling at a paltry 24 million litres a year , compared with annual petrol and diesel consumption of about 20 billion litres .

for many people one third the age of joan court this would be a challenge .
but the 85-year-old is embarking on a 48-hour hunger strike over a new £ 18m centre at oxford university that will house animals destined for research .
the former social worker and midwife told bbc news online : " i think it 's imperative for us to make our protests as moral agents . "
ms court , of cambridge , will begin fasting outside the facility , in south parks road , oxford , at 1000 bst on wednesday . "
i keep wondering about the weather and thinking i must get hold of a good umbrella " joan court the centre , which the university says will replace a number of existing animal houses , is currently under construction .
university officials say the amount of research carried out on animals , mostly rodents , is not increasing .
ms court , who has been an animal rights campaigner for 25 years , said : " i went to the site for a regular , weekly protest last thursday and the sheer sadness of it all got to me .
" so i thought to myself , ' well at least i could do a hunger strike ' .
" gandhi influenced me a great deal when i was younger - at the time , he was bringing down the british empire in india with hunger strikes .
" i do n't think we can bring down the vivisection industry , but we can give it a good try .
" we intend to stop the building being built if we can by one means or another .
" i just do n't think we should violate the rights of creatures who have no rights ; it 's the same as slavery but i hope it wo n't take 100 years to stop this . "
she said she had done little preparation for the hunger strike , to be held outside the construction site , but has a sleeping bag at the ready to keep her warm at night .
" i keep wondering about the weather and thinking i must get hold of a good umbrella .
" i 've got a sleeping bag , books and bottles of water and i 'm sure there will be other people in oxford who will be around to bring me more water . "
leukaemia and cancer treatment ms court was a prominent figure in the campaign and eventual victory against plans by the government and cambridge university to build europe 's largest primate laboratory .
university bosses say animals at the oxford university centre will only be used in research programmes of the highest quality and where there are no alternatives .

despite efforts by china 's government to cool its fast-growing economy , the country drew in almost $ 8bn -lrb- £ 4.3bn -rrb- of foreign direct investment last month .
june 's $ 7.97bn figure was up 14 % on the previous high of $ 7.66bn set in the same month last year .
for the first half of 2004 as a whole , china 's foreign direct investment was up 11.99 % on last year to $ 33.9bn.
hsbc economist qu hongbin said the figures show that overseas investors believe the chinese government is able to prevent the economy overheating as it continues to expand rapidly .
" basically the message is that the long-term investors and foreign multinationals have been little affected by the policy tightening measures , " he said .
" you could also read it as people are still pretty confident that the government is able to manage overheating . "
carmakers the chinese government has moved to contain the country 's ultra-rapid economic growth as supplies of power and raw materials have become stretched and started to fuel inflationary pressure .
actions it has taken include enforcing some lending restrictions and the tightening of land-use rules to slow industrial developments .
yet beijing still warmly welcomes foreign investment , not only as a source of cash , but also for the overseas technical and managerial expertise .
foreign companies are in turn attracted by china 's vast pool of cheap labour and the fast-growing economy .
back in june us car giant general motors said it would invest $ 3bn to double capacity in china by 2007 , and germany 's volkswagen said it would spend $ 900m on two new engine plants and a car factory .
the organisation of economic co-operation and development also reported in june that china overtook the us as the biggest recipient of foreign direct investment in 2003 .

despite efforts by china 's government to cool its fast-growing economy , the country drew in almost $ 8bn -lrb- £ 4.3bn -rrb- of foreign direct investment last month .
june 's $ 7.97bn figure was up 14 % on the previous high of $ 7.66bn set in the same month last year .
for the first half of 2004 as a whole , china 's foreign direct investment was up 11.99 % on last year to $ 33.9bn.
hsbc economist qu hongbin said the figures show that overseas investors believe the chinese government is able to prevent the economy overheating as it continues to expand rapidly .
" basically the message is that the long-term investors and foreign multinationals have been little affected by the policy tightening measures , " he said .
" you could also read it as people are still pretty confident that the government is able to manage overheating . "
carmakers the chinese government has moved to contain the country 's ultra-rapid economic growth as supplies of power and raw materials have become stretched and started to fuel inflationary pressure .
actions it has taken include enforcing some lending restrictions and the tightening of land-use rules to slow industrial developments .
yet beijing still warmly welcomes foreign investment , not only as a source of cash , but also for the overseas technical and managerial expertise .
foreign companies are in turn attracted by china 's vast pool of cheap labour and the fast-growing economy .
back in june us car giant general motors said it would invest $ 3bn to double capacity in china by 2007 , and germany 's volkswagen said it would spend $ 900m on two new engine plants and a car factory .
the organisation of economic co-operation and development also reported in june that china overtook the us as the biggest recipient of foreign direct investment in 2003 .

the advantages of broadband technology will be at the centre of the welsh development agency 's -lrb- wda -rrb- display at the agricultural showpiece .
in partnership with d-link and powys county council , the agency will have an area around the main ring for wireless broadband .
farmers and other visitors will be able to watch high speed access to the internet and email via enabled laptop computers , electronic personal organisers and other mobile devices in action .
the advances in technology at the centenary event at llanelwedd , near builth wells , will be a far cry from the first in aberystwyth , in 1904 .
" we 're aiming to show just how wireless broadband technology can open up an array of opportunities for businesses , farmers , individuals and communities throughout rural wales , " said peter williams of the wda 's media technology programmes .
" the potential is amazing .
the technology will highlight how you can access important emails or even agricultural market information from the internet with a laptop computer without having to be connected via a landline .
" you could be watching the cobs in the show-ring from the grandstand while checking up on the very latest market prices elsewhere in the uk or even further afield . "
' switching on ' he added : " the aim is to highlight how businesses and individuals can have the added flexibility of a wireless environment , whether it is for business or pleasure . "
among the benefits of going online is the british cattle movement register where farmers can log details of their beasts in order to receive passports .
beef and sheep farmer glyn roberts , from ysbyty ifan , near betws-y-coed , says farmers are more receptive to the internet now .
he added that the change had been forced on older farmers by their children who have grown up with computers .
" even the farmer who , at one time , knew the least about new technology is switching on to the internet , " said father-of-five mr roberts , chairman of the farmers ' union of wales ' bilingual committee .
" farmers have to register every new-born calf and i do that now via the internet because it 's instant and you can guarantee registration .
the post can be unreliable .
" i also use the internet to gather information such as details about the common agricultural policy .
" younger farmers are obviously using the internet more as a business aid and they are forcing the change .
" you 'll find that younger farmers will be tutoring their parents in the ways of the internet and that 's what happened to me .
mr roberts added : " there are huge benefits to using the internet for business use and farmers are beginning to see . "

the advantages of broadband technology will be at the centre of the welsh development agency 's -lrb- wda -rrb- display at the agricultural showpiece .
in partnership with d-link and powys county council , the agency will have an area around the main ring for wireless broadband .
farmers and other visitors will be able to watch high speed access to the internet and email via enabled laptop computers , electronic personal organisers and other mobile devices in action .
the advances in technology at the centenary event at llanelwedd , near builth wells , will be a far cry from the first in aberystwyth , in 1904 .
" we 're aiming to show just how wireless broadband technology can open up an array of opportunities for businesses , farmers , individuals and communities throughout rural wales , " said peter williams of the wda 's media technology programmes .
" the potential is amazing .
the technology will highlight how you can access important emails or even agricultural market information from the internet with a laptop computer without having to be connected via a landline .
" you could be watching the cobs in the show-ring from the grandstand while checking up on the very latest market prices elsewhere in the uk or even further afield . "
' switching on ' he added : " the aim is to highlight how businesses and individuals can have the added flexibility of a wireless environment , whether it is for business or pleasure . "
among the benefits of going online is the british cattle movement register where farmers can log details of their beasts in order to receive passports .
some farmers are using the internet to improve their businesses beef and sheep farmer glyn roberts , from ysbyty ifan , near betws-y-coed , says farmers are more receptive to the internet now .
he added that the change had been forced on older farmers by their children who have grown up with computers .
" even the farmer who , at one time , knew the least about new technology is switching on to the internet , " said father-of-five mr roberts , chairman of the farmers ' union of wales ' bilingual committee .
" farmers have to register every new-born calf and i do that now via the internet because it 's instant and you can guarantee registration .
the post can be unreliable .
" i also use the internet to gather information such as details about the common agricultural policy .
" younger farmers are obviously using the internet more as a business aid and they are forcing the change .
" you 'll find that younger farmers will be tutoring their parents in the ways of the internet and that 's what happened to me .
mr roberts added : " there are huge benefits to using the internet for business use and farmers are beginning to see . "

in 1994 , a young couple bought the ruins of gwydir castle , near llanrwst , and started a remarkable adventure which has seen them troubled by ghosts , ravaged by floods and even sent on a top-secret journey through the back streets of new york .
this year , they have celebrated the 10th anniversary of their work by finishing the roof , allowing them to finally remove the buckets which have been catching drips for decades .
with visitor numbers on the rise , and an appearance on bbc two 's restoration programme coming soon , their hard work seems to be reaping rewards .
for judy corbett and peter welford , it was love at first sight when they first stumbled upon gwydir castle , which fuses medieval , tudor and gothic architecture . "
it is all quiet on the ghost front now - the house has a happy atmosphere " judy corbett the castle , on the banks of the river conwy , was built around 1500 , but had suffered years of neglect and abuse in recent years .
with hindsight , ms corbett admitted they were not initially aware of the scale of the project .
" had we thought too hard at the start , we would never have done it , " she said .
" but we had nothing to lose , and now , we have become part of the house . "
if you think you have heard of the castle before , it might be because of its reputation as one of wales ' most haunted buildings .
but after some early difficulties with the ghosts , ms corbett now thinks the situation is under control and that they - and their b & b guests - have been accepted .
" it is all quiet on the ghost front now - the house has a happy atmosphere . "
the castle also hit the headlines when the couple discovered that ornate panelling from the dining room had been stripped out and sold to media magnate william randolph hearst -lrb- the inspiration for the film citizen kane -rrb- .
after tracking it down to metropolitan museum of art in new york , they managed to buy it back , but only after being taken on a secret trip to one of the museum 's giant warehouses full of international treasures , hidden somewhere in the city 's sprawling suburbs .
" it was quite strange - we did n't know where we were going or what we would see - it was very starsky and hutch , " she said .
now the chase is on again , to find another batch of panelling taken from another room at the same time .
" we have traced it as far as 1937 - it came out that the room belonged to an american antiques dealer in new york , but then we lose track of it .
" we have to pick up the leads on it , and search in a systematic way . "
as well as chasing the missing room , the couple are also planning to start work on the four-storey solar tower , which was badly fire-damaged in 1922 .
and they are also keen to start replanting in the grade one listed gardens , which were badly flooded earlier this year , after rains which hit llanrwst and the nearby village of trefriw .
" the gardens were completely under , but the environment agency came at just the right time to pump out the cellar , as it had filled up . "
tv stars earlier this year , judy corbett 's book about the couple 's adventure castles in the air was published , and has helped spark interest in their efforts .
" visitor numbers are up , and we have been filming with griff rhys jones for restoration , " she said .
but she admitted she was not quite sure of what the programme was as the couple do not have a tv .
however , she does not crave the multimillion prize that the series gives out to the winner - gwydir castle will appear as a feature on the show , but not in the main viewer vote section .
" too much money can damage a restoration - we can do it slowly and carefully .
" the most critical thing is understanding the building , and not making rash decisions until you know what you are doing . "
the new series of restoration begins at 2100 bst on tuesday night on bbc two .

in 1994 , a young couple bought the ruins of gwydir castle , near llanrwst , and started a remarkable adventure which has seen them troubled by ghosts , ravaged by floods and even sent on a top-secret journey through the back streets of new york .
this year , they have celebrated the 10th anniversary of their work by finishing the roof , allowing them to finally remove the buckets which have been catching drips for decades .
with visitor numbers on the rise , and an appearance on bbc two 's restoration programme coming soon , their hard work seems to be reaping rewards .
for judy corbett and peter welford , it was love at first sight when they first stumbled upon gwydir castle , which fuses medieval , tudor and gothic architecture .
it is all quiet on the ghost front now - the house has a happy atmosphere judy corbett the castle , on the banks of the river conwy , was built around 1500 , but had suffered years of neglect and abuse in recent years .
with hindsight , ms corbett admitted they were not initially aware of the scale of the project .
" had we thought too hard at the start , we would never have done it , " she said .
" but we had nothing to lose , and now , we have become part of the house . "
if you think you have heard of the castle before , it might be because of its reputation as one of wales ' most haunted buildings .
but after some early difficulties with the ghosts , ms corbett now thinks the situation is under control and that they - and their b & b guests - have been accepted .
the dining room in 1896 before the panelling vanished " it is all quiet on the ghost front now - the house has a happy atmosphere . "
the castle also hit the headlines when the couple discovered that ornate panelling from the dining room had been stripped out and sold to media magnate william randolph hearst -lrb- the inspiration for the film citizen kane -rrb- .
after tracking it down to metropolitan museum of art in new york , they managed to buy it back , but only after being taken on a secret trip to one of the museum 's giant warehouses full of international treasures , hidden somewhere in the city 's sprawling suburbs .
" it was quite strange - we did n't know where we were going or what we would see - it was very starsky and hutch , " she said .
now the chase is on again , to find another batch of panelling taken from another room at the same time .
griff rhys jones visited for the second series of restoration " we have traced it as far as 1937 - it came out that the room belonged to an american antiques dealer in new york , but then we lose track of it .
" we have to pick up the leads on it , and search in a systematic way . "
as well as chasing the missing room , the couple are also planning to start work on the four-storey solar tower , which was badly fire-damaged in 1922 .
and they are also keen to start replanting in the grade one listed gardens , which were badly flooded earlier this year , after rains which hit llanrwst and the nearby village of trefriw .
" the gardens were completely under , but the environment agency came at just the right time to pump out the cellar , as it had filled up . "
tv stars earlier this year , judy corbett 's book about the couple 's adventure castles in the air was published , and has helped spark interest in their efforts .
the gardens at the castle are grade one listed " visitor numbers are up , and we have been filming with griff rhys jones for restoration , " she said .
but she admitted she was not quite sure of what the programme was as the couple do not have a tv .
however , she does not crave the multimillion prize that the series gives out to the winner - gwydir castle will appear as a feature on the show , but not in the main viewer vote section .
" too much money can damage a restoration - we can do it slowly and carefully .
" the most critical thing is understanding the building , and not making rash decisions until you know what you are doing . "
the new series of restoration begins at 2100 bst on tuesday night on bbc two .

customer numbers failed to meet expectations , forcing egg to almost double its investment budget and delay a target for breaking even by a year to 2005 .
in october last year egg said it was seeking a joint venture partner in france to help develop the business .
but this search for a partner was superseded by prudential 's announcement in january that it was looking for a buyer for its egg stake .

un oeuf is un oeuf egg 's french business has struggled ever since it launched its la carte egg credit card in 2002 , following the purchase of french internet bank zebank .
customer numbers failed to meet expectations , forcing egg to almost double its investment budget and delay a target for breaking even by a year to 2005 .
in october last year egg said it was seeking a joint venture partner in france to help develop the business .
but this search for a partner was superseded by prudential 's announcement in january that it was looking for a buyer for its egg stake .
" following the slow start we experienced in france , we have been clear that egg is not prepared to make the level of investment on a stand-alone basis that our revised plan shows the business needs for it to be successful , " said egg chief executive paul gratton .
in a statement , prudential said it was still in talks over the sale of its egg shareholding .

mike asked us not to use his full name because he 's dealing with some heavy cross-border criminals .
his group of volunteers at 419eater.com use their computer skills to fool the scammers , to disrupt their crimes , and to have some fun at the scammer 's expense .
every day , millions of people get e-mails like this : " dear sir / madam , i am fine today and how are you ?
i hope this letter will find you in the best of health .
i am prince joe eboh , the chairman of the " contract award committee " , of the " niger delta development commission -lrb- nddc -rrb- " , a subsidiary of the nigerian national petroleum corporation -lrb- nnpc -rrb- .
nddc was set up by the late head of state , general sani abacha who died on 18th june 1998 , to manage the excess revenue accruing from the sales of petroleum and its allied products as a domestic increase in the petroleum products to develop the communities in the niger delta oil producing areas .
the estimated annual revenue for 1999 was $ 45 billion us dollars ... "
and of course , if you were only willing to help the writer siphon some of it off , a few of those many millions could be yours .
police estimate that every year , us citizens alone are conned out of some $ 200m .

i have been troubled recently after the death of a dear friend of mine , minnie mowse " ' father hector barnett ' " i tried to turn it round by saying i worked for a church and we could n't do any business with people who are not of our faith . "
mike sent a response in the name of father hector barnett of the church of the painted breast . "
dear sir , i would dearly love to help you .
if you ever decide to join our faith then of course i could help you both with my experience and financial support .
i wish you well in your endeavour my brother .
yours , father hector barnett " " now i knew the guy would write back and say : ' well , can i join your faith ? ' and indeed he did , " says mike . "
dear father hector , if joining your faith is what it takes to help me of course , i am ready to join you .
i 'm from a good christian family .
i will do anything you want me to do in the faith .
do n't forget that i have to transfer the money to your account as urgently as possible .
send me your account details .
i hope to read your mail soon .
prince joe eboh " ' war-paint ' " dear joe , our ministry was founded in 1774 by a wonderful lady by the name of betsy carrington .
she spent many of her first preaching years in kenya , spreading the holy gospel amongst the local people there .
she was the first person male or female to promote christian texts and beliefs to the masai warrior tribe .
the most famous account is when as a test she had to remove the top part of her clothes and paint the top half of her body and breast with the red masai war-paint as a gesture of faith and belief to them so that they would accept her and trust her .
she was almost immediately accepted by them and was one of the most trusted westerners known at that time .
as a qualification to enter the holy church of the order of the red breast , all followers must go through the initiation procedure that miss carrington made so famous .
i have attached a photograph of four of our young inductees going through the procedure .
please use this picture to enable you to make the same marking on yourself .
i have also attached a small picture showing the design in more detail .
i look forward to welcoming you into our membership my brother .
father hector barnett financial development - holy church of the order of the red breast . "
' processing fees ' using image software , mike made up an " initiation " picture .
and prince joe duly carried out the induction and e-mailed back a photo of himself in the properly sanctified state . "
dear brother hector , i want to thank the almighty god himself for the opportunity i have to be a member of this great church the holy church of the painted breast .
i 'm looking forward to establishing a branch of the church here .
but i 'll like us to finish everything about the business proposal , which i sent to you earlier ... "
" he then tried to hit me for $ 18,000 for processing fees for transferring millions , " mike says .
he wrote back as father hector , saying that the church had plenty of money , but there was a withdrawal fee of $ 80 .
" i persuaded him to send me the $ 80 , which he did , inside a birthday card , by courier , " mike says .
however , former scotland yard fraud officer tom craig says that it is unprecedented for the 419 con artists to part with any money - he suggests the notes may have been forged .
mike says that any money they get from these reverse stings goes to a children 's charity in the north of england .
exporting snow father hector of the church of the painted breast then entered a troubling period of religious uncertainty . "
dear joe , this is your good friend hector barnett .
please do not be alarmed that i am contacting you from a different e-mail address .
i will explain what has happened . "
the guy obviously thought he was going to get $ 18,000 so easily , he was blinded by his own greed " mike i have been troubled recently after the death of a dear friend of mine , minnie mowse .
she was a very , very dear friend indeed , and her death affected me greatly and started to make me question my faith .
i have decided to leave the church and join a travelling circus .
i have already made two very good friends , and tomorrow i will be starting my circus training with them ... "
prince joe then began receiving e-mails from another " reverend " of the church of the painted breast worried about the disappearance of father hector and $ 18,000 from church funds .
joe already knew from hector 's increasingly eccentric e-mails that he had put the money into a business exporting snow to siberia .
lottery winnings despite that , prince joe still has n't given up , even though he 's $ 80 down .
the e-mail exchange between the probably fake prince and the obviously fake church continues .
at the same time , the scambaiters are running several other such stings .
i asked mike why these people who are themselves scammers ca n't spot an obvious scam .
" i think it operates in much the same way as it does with real victims .
greed clouds their judgement .
the guy obviously thought he was going to get $ 18,000 so easily , he was blinded by his own greed .
" which is what happens to those who fall for the 419 scams ; they just see all these millions . "
this would all be funny if it was n't for the millions of dollars being stolen and probably put into drugs or other criminal activities .
mike and his friends send all their e-mail exchanges to the police in the uk , nigeria and to the fbi - he says they 've had no response .
and even warning the victims does no good .
most of them do n't want to believe they 're being scammed .
the latest e-mail scam concerns lottery winnings you did n't know you had .
if you 're tempted , just remember prince joe who 's still sending e-mails saying he 's sticking to his promise and saying the daily prayer : " when all above seems a great test , get on down with the holy red breast . "
" dear father , when i said the prayer this morning , something like a fountain went down my system making me to feel strong & happy .
i have spent money to process all the necessary documents for the transfer of this fund .
what remains now is the registration of your name as the contractor who executed the contract .
yours , joe . "

and prince joe duly carried out the induction and e-mailed back a photo of himself in the properly sanctified state .
dear brother hector , i want to thank the almighty god himself for the opportunity i have to be a member of this great church the holy church of the painted breast .
i 'm looking forward to establishing a branch of the church here .
but i 'll like us to finish everything about the business proposal , which i sent to you earlier ...
the picture sent by prince joe eboh " he then tried to hit me for $ 18,000 for processing fees for transferring millions , " mike says .
he wrote back as father hector , saying that the church had plenty of money , but there was a withdrawal fee of $ 80 .
" i persuaded him to send me the $ 80 , which he did , inside a birthday card , by courier , " mike says .
however , former scotland yard fraud officer tom craig says that it is unprecedented for the 419 con artists to part with any money - he suggests the notes may have been forged .
mike says that any money they get from these reverse stings goes to a children 's charity in the north of england .
exporting snow father hector of the church of the painted breast then entered a troubling period of religious uncertainty .
dear joe , this is your good friend hector barnett .
please do not be alarmed that i am contacting you from a different e-mail address .
i will explain what has happened .
the guy obviously thought he was going to get $ 18,000 so easily , he was blinded by his own greed mike i have been troubled recently after the death of a dear friend of mine , minnie mowse .
she was a very , very dear friend indeed , and her death affected me greatly and started to make me question my faith .
i have decided to leave the church and join a travelling circus .
i have already made two very good friends , and tomorrow i will be starting my circus training with them ...
prince joe then began receiving e-mails from another " reverend " of the church of the painted breast worried about the disappearance of father hector and $ 18,000 from church funds .
joe already knew from hector 's increasingly eccentric e-mails that he had put the money into a business exporting snow to siberia .
lottery winnings despite that , prince joe still has n't given up , even though he 's $ 80 down .
the e-mail exchange between the probably fake prince and the obviously fake church continues .
at the same time , the scambaiters are running several other such stings .
i asked mike why these people who are themselves scammers ca n't spot an obvious scam .
" i think it operates in much the same way as it does with real victims .
greed clouds their judgement .
the guy obviously thought he was going to get $ 18,000 so easily , he was blinded by his own greed .
" which is what happens to those who fall for the 419 scams ; they just see all these millions . "
this would all be funny if it was n't for the millions of dollars being stolen and probably put into drugs or other criminal activities .
mike and his friends send all their e-mail exchanges to the police in the uk , nigeria and to the fbi - he says they 've had no response .
and even warning the victims does no good .
most of them do n't want to believe they 're being scammed .
the latest e-mail scam concerns lottery winnings you did n't know you had .
if you 're tempted , just remember prince joe who 's still sending e-mails saying he 's sticking to his promise and saying the daily prayer : " when all above seems a great test , get on down with the holy red breast . "
dear father , when i said the prayer this morning , something like a fountain went down my system making me to feel strong & happy .
i have spent money to process all the necessary documents for the transfer of this fund .
what remains now is the registration of your name as the contractor who executed the contract .
yours , joe .
