but her victory was tinged with disappointment .
two years ago , merkel was elected with 93.7 percent of delegates ' votes .

internal disagreements over health care reform and personnel shake-ups cost merkel backing from within the cdu and lost the party some support among the general public .
merkel became head of germany 's largest conservative party in 2000 . dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

however , documents from the dutch justice ministry , obtained by the paper , show that the dutch government hindered further judicial investigations against the plant .
the dutch ministry of foreign affairs allegedly feared a diplomatic conflict with the european commission .
the commission had stated in a series of letters to the dutch authorities that it would find prosecution of the petten plant staff unacceptable , as commission employees working at petten possess legal immunity in the netherlands .
ongoing investigations against the plant by the dutch public prosecutor were therefore hastily broken off in march 2004 .
both the joint research center and the dutch ministry for the environment reacted over the weekend saying that after a series of recent improvements , safety at the plant is now guaranteed .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .

twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .

but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .

it is the first annual decline in company insolvencies since 1999 .
personal insolvencies , on the other hand , continued to rise , climbing 40 percent in 2004 to 48,000 .
however , analysts say that the jump could partly be due to new rules that went into effect at the end of 2001 that allowed costs to be deferred and that it does not necessarily reflect an extreme worsening of economic conditions among consumers . dw-world.de more germans caught in spiral of debt a new study shows that increasing numbers of german households are unable to manage their debt .
meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc angela merkel reelected cdu party chief at a party congress in the western german city of düsseldorf , conservative opposition leader angela merkel has been reelected chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
but her victory was tinged with disappointment .
two years ago , merkel was elected with 93.7 percent of delegates ' votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .
unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .
in march 2001 , in one of his first acts after taking office , president george w. bush said his country , despite having signed the 1997 draft agreement , would not ratify the protocol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at a greenpeace rally on earth day in washington april 18 , 2001 .
bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .
verteidigungsminister struck -lrb- spd -rrb- will gegen das kölner gerichtsurteil zur einberufungspraxis der bundeswehr rechtsmittel einlegen .
" ich bin nach wie vor der überzeugung , dass unser rechtsstandpunkt sich vor dem bundesverwaltungsgericht durchsetzen wird " , sagte struck am 23 .
april 2004 .
das verwaltungsgericht hatte entschieden , dass die derzeitige einberufungsregelung gegen das willkürverbot des grundgesetzes verstößt .
er empfinde die jetzige situation bei der einberufung " nicht als ungerecht " , so struck .
von den männern eines jahrgangs blieben für den wehrdienst nur etwa 35 prozent übrig , weil der rest verweigere oder aus gesundheitlichen gründen nicht eingezogen werden könne .

the issue of patriotism , long controversial in germany , will be a central plank of this week 's conservative pow-wow . analysts say the focus on these kinds of questions reflects their realization that internal struggles over questions of health reform and personnel have been damaging .
they 're now looking for common ground with which they can score points in the lead-up to the 2006 election . " we will send a signal of unity at the party congress , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers said last week .
" the time for internal debates is over . " fusty image the party will attempt to chart a new course following the resignation in october of merkel 's deputy parliamentary group leader and finance expert , friedrich merz , who walked out in a huff after a bitter power struggle . with the subsequent departure of the csu 's deputy parliamentary group leader horst seehofer over merkel 's health care reform scheme , the bloc is lacking high-profile figures who can sell its policies and connect with the public . in an internal report called " plea for a new direction , " parliamentary deputy julia klöckner , 31 , complained the party had an image as " cold , technocratic and dull " and was turning off city dwellers , families and young women . " the union does not embody their lifestyle , issues and does not speak their language , " she wrote in the report , quoted in the news magazine der spiegel . a survey this week by the independent polling institute forsa confirmed her view , showing that the christian union bloc 's support had dropped to 38 percent , far below the 50 percent it was garnering in march . schröder 's social democrats reached a respectable 32 percent , up from their historic low struck this summer of 23 percent . key state elections in schleswig-holstein in february and in north rhine-westphalia in may are fast approaching .
both of them will be seen as tests for both schröder and merkel and both politicians know there is little time to lose . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scotches rumors of power struggle germany ’ s conservative party leader angela merkel has brushed aside allegations that some senior members of her christian democratic union are plotting against her in an effort to unseat her as party chairwoman .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition supporters seen in the parliament in tbilisi , georgia on nov .
22 , 2003 .
on nov .
23 , mikhail saakashvili burst into the parliament , leading the crowd holding a long-stemmed rose in his hand and prompting shevardnadze to flee the building .
is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .
press restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians read fresh newspapers to get to know results of presidential elections in tbilisi on jan .
5 , 2004 .
slowly but surely , the media is becoming the mouthpiece of the government , a development set to be consolidated by new press laws .
" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
" i think -lrb- the president 's -rrb- desire for increased power and the constitutional changes he made were a clear expression of a new policy , " said opposition politician koba davitaschvili .
" it 's one step closer towards an authoritarian regime .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .

" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .

that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .

when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2004 the rose revolution shows its thorns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili pledged to bring prosperity to the ex-soviet republic mass unrest over vote-rigging in georgia led to the replacement of veteran leader eduard shevardnadze by western-leaning mikhail saakashvili one year ago .
some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

22 , 2003 .
on nov .
23 , mikhail saakashvili burst into the parliament , leading the crowd holding a long-stemmed rose in his hand and prompting shevardnadze to flee the building .
is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .
press restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians read fresh newspapers to get to know results of presidential elections in tbilisi on jan .
5 , 2004 .
slowly but surely , the media is becoming the mouthpiece of the government , a development set to be consolidated by new press laws .
" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .
unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .
in march 2001 , in one of his first acts after taking office , president george w. bush said his country , despite having signed the 1997 draft agreement , would not ratify the protocol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at a greenpeace rally on earth day in washington april 18 , 2001 .
bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .

unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 decision time for germany 's " iron lady " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- right -rrb- getting ready for the big event opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .
she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .
verteidigungsminister struck -lrb- spd -rrb- will gegen das kölner gerichtsurteil zur einberufungspraxis der bundeswehr rechtsmittel einlegen .
" ich bin nach wie vor der überzeugung , dass unser rechtsstandpunkt sich vor dem bundesverwaltungsgericht durchsetzen wird " , sagte struck am 23 .
april 2004 .
das verwaltungsgericht hatte entschieden , dass die derzeitige einberufungsregelung gegen das willkürverbot des grundgesetzes verstößt .
er empfinde die jetzige situation bei der einberufung " nicht als ungerecht " , so struck .
von den männern eines jahrgangs blieben für den wehrdienst nur etwa 35 prozent übrig , weil der rest verweigere oder aus gesundheitlichen gründen nicht eingezogen werden könne .
zur regelung , dass keine verheirateten und keine männer über 23 jahren mehr eingezogen werden , sei ein gesetzentwurf in arbeit .
the issue of patriotism , long controversial in germany , will be a central plank of this week 's conservative pow-wow . analysts say the focus on these kinds of questions reflects their realization that internal struggles over questions of health reform and personnel have been damaging .
they 're now looking for common ground with which they can score points in the lead-up to the 2006 election . " we will send a signal of unity at the party congress , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers said last week .
" the time for internal debates is over .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .

" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .

slowly but surely , the media is becoming the mouthpiece of the government , a development set to be consolidated by new press laws .
" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
" i think -lrb- the president 's -rrb- desire for increased power and the constitutional changes he made were a clear expression of a new policy , " said opposition politician koba davitaschvili .

" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
" i think -lrb- the president 's -rrb- desire for increased power and the constitutional changes he made were a clear expression of a new policy , " said opposition politician koba davitaschvili .
" it 's one step closer towards an authoritarian regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .
unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .
in march 2001 , in one of his first acts after taking office , president george w. bush said his country , despite having signed the 1997 draft agreement , would not ratify the protocol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at a greenpeace rally on earth day in washington april 18 , 2001 .
bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2004 the rose revolution shows its thorns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili pledged to bring prosperity to the ex-soviet republic mass unrest over vote-rigging in georgia led to the replacement of veteran leader eduard shevardnadze by western-leaning mikhail saakashvili one year ago .
some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition supporters seen in the parliament in tbilisi , georgia on nov .
22 , 2003 .
on nov .
23 , mikhail saakashvili burst into the parliament , leading the crowd holding a long-stemmed rose in his hand and prompting shevardnadze to flee the building .
is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .
press restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians read fresh newspapers to get to know results of presidential elections in tbilisi on jan .
5 , 2004 .
slowly but surely , the media is becoming the mouthpiece of the government , a development set to be consolidated by new press laws .
" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
" i think -lrb- the president 's -rrb- desire for increased power and the constitutional changes he made were a clear expression of a new policy , " said opposition politician koba davitaschvili .
" it 's one step closer towards an authoritarian regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 decision time for germany 's " iron lady " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- right -rrb- getting ready for the big event opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .
she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .

" ich bin nach wie vor der überzeugung , dass unser rechtsstandpunkt sich vor dem bundesverwaltungsgericht durchsetzen wird " , sagte struck am 23 .
april 2004 .
das verwaltungsgericht hatte entschieden , dass die derzeitige einberufungsregelung gegen das willkürverbot des grundgesetzes verstößt .
er empfinde die jetzige situation bei der einberufung " nicht als ungerecht " , so struck .
von den männern eines jahrgangs blieben für den wehrdienst nur etwa 35 prozent übrig , weil der rest verweigere oder aus gesundheitlichen gründen nicht eingezogen werden könne .
zur regelung , dass keine verheirateten und keine männer über 23 jahren mehr eingezogen werden , sei ein gesetzentwurf in arbeit .

" the union does not embody their lifestyle , issues and does not speak their language , " she wrote in the report , quoted in the news magazine der spiegel . a survey this week by the independent polling institute forsa confirmed her view , showing that the christian union bloc 's support had dropped to 38 percent , far below the 50 percent it was garnering in march . schröder 's social democrats reached a respectable 32 percent , up from their historic low struck this summer of 23 percent . key state elections in schleswig-holstein in february and in north rhine-westphalia in may are fast approaching .

on wednesday a china-eu summit will take place in the hague , and many are expecting the embargo to be the key focus of discussion . chancellor schröder told xinhua news agency his government would “ strive for a consensus to be reached as early as possible ” on lifting the sanction .
while the german leader has made no secret out of his opposition to the ban , the german parliament voted at the end of october for the embargo to be kept in place .
the european parliament in strasbourg also voted against revoking it in mid-november . human rights record to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and chinese prime minister wen jiabao at a meeting in berlin on monday , may 3 , 2004 .
several eu members have cited china ’ s poor human rights record as a chief concern in lifting the arms embargo and china has sought to enlist schröder and french president jacques chirac ’ s help to allay those fears . in the past , schröder has pressed for the lifting of the ban in discussions with other eu leaders , and chirac , who was in china in october , referred to the embargo as a “ relic ” of the past and said it was high-time the eu voted to remove it . " this is a very solemn , serious political issue , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday .
" we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " the ban is “ incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership ” and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , zhang added . china , which is unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe , and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from the likely lucrative trade . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor under fire over china arms ban german chancellor gerhard schröder came under criticism on saturday for favoring the lifting of the european arms embargo on china against the wishes of the german and european parliaments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .
unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .
in march 2001 , in one of his first acts after taking office , president george w. bush said his country , despite having signed the 1997 draft agreement , would not ratify the protocol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at a greenpeace rally on earth day in washington april 18 , 2001 .
bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .

but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .

bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .

" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

23 , mikhail saakashvili burst into the parliament , leading the crowd holding a long-stemmed rose in his hand and prompting shevardnadze to flee the building .
is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .

slowly but surely , the media is becoming the mouthpiece of the government , a development set to be consolidated by new press laws .
" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
" i think -lrb- the president 's -rrb- desire for increased power and the constitutional changes he made were a clear expression of a new policy , " said opposition politician koba davitaschvili .

the international jury honored weblogs in 11 categories and over 60,000 users voted to award user prizes in each of the categories . " if we ca n't talk about people than we 'll talk about dogs , " said the jury prize winner in the deutsche welle international weblog awards 2004 , the first international blog competition . deciding to honor " the dog newspaper " with the best weblog award from seven different languages was relatively easy for the best of the blogs - the bobs - jury members . put together with a collage style , the blog presents the unfair conditions suffered by dogs in china and asia compared to the treatment of animals in the western world . successful metaphor " the jury members saw the winning blog as a successful metaphor for the situation of people living in china and other nations , " said guido baumhauer , online editor-in-chief at deutsche welle and bobs organizer .
" the blog is a good example of weblogs bringing up an issue that is not tackled by the traditional media . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese erotic blogger star and bobs jury member mu zimei " the weblog can be understood as a parable , " chinese jury member mu zimei -lrb- photo -rrb- confirmed .
" the way dogs live is projected onto the lives of humans – dogs ’ rights onto human rights . " the rest of the bobs jury – which consisted of 10 representatives from seven languages – was convinced the " dog newspaper " best filled the tough criteria for the best weblog honors with its unique angle , its good use of design and well-written entries .
it also won a second award for best journalistic chinese blog . the blog 's creator , known only under his internet name of the " aggressive little snake , " said he was pleased to hear the results . " i did not expect to win the bobs , there are probably a lot of other people who are surprised as well , " said " little snake , " whom sponsors will present with a top-of-the-line notebook computer .
" i think my winning an award like this might encourage other bloggers . " english language winners the jury 's award for the best journalistic blog in english went to the " lessig blog . "
lawrence lessig uses his weblog to focus the public 's attention on digital media matters and also mentions political and social issues .
a law professor at stanford university , lessig was able to beat out stiff competition from some of the best-known blogs in the english language , such as " talking points memo " and " bloggerheads . " " editor : myself , " a weblog that examines the iranian government 's crack down on freedom of the press , won the english user award in the best journalistic blog category . large response in latin america the competition 's global perspective is what set it apart from other blog contests and meant it could produce a better picture of the international blog scene , baumhauer said at the end of a competition which included over 1,000 entries from around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury members did n't have too hard a time deciding on the best weblog award " the international jury was especially impressed with the numerous entries that came from spain and latin america , while interest from the english-speaking world was surprisingly low , " he added . the jury awarded the bob in the best topic category to the spanish weblog " el hombre que comía diccionarios " -lrb- the man who ate reference works -rrb- .
the blog 's snippets of random knowledge function as a " metaphor for internet culture , " said well-known spanish blogger and bobs jury member dr. josé luis orihuela . many languages , many blogs " the suggested blogs were of very high quality , " reported bobs jury member , dw-tv editor and german weblog veteran konstantin klein .
" regular updates and innovative ideas were important criteria for me , " he said of the tough jury process . klein ’ s interest and active personal involvement in the competition was shared by all the jury members , who knew they needed to take a long , hard look at the nominated weblogs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel is better known as schockwellenreiter.de " what is a really good blog today can be a really bad blog tomorrow , " said jury member jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , who writes one of the german blogosphere 's best-known blogs , " schockwellenreiter.de. " judging blogs in seven different languages also presented a challenge for the jury members .
they received editorial support from the editors at dw-world.de , the deutsche welle 's multi-lingual internet presence . over 60,000 online votes in addition to the 11 jury awards -lrb- one for each category including seven language journalism awards and awards for best topic , design and innovation as well as best overall weblog -rrb- , 11 other bobs were given out in the user prizes . the users ' choice for best weblog award went to brazilian blogging pioneer nemo nox 's " por um punhado de pixels " -lrb- for a handful of pixels -rrb- . there were some 67,000 votes cast in the online voting , said holger hank , editorial director at dw-world .
“ that is a result we can be very happy with , " he added . " our intention was to get in contact with the international weblog community , and that certainly worked , " hank said .
" weblogs are an internet format with a future . " the bobs also have a future , according to hank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .
unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .
in march 2001 , in one of his first acts after taking office , president george w. bush said his country , despite having signed the 1997 draft agreement , would not ratify the protocol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at a greenpeace rally on earth day in washington april 18 , 2001 .
bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2004 climate control after kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is causing glaciers in argentina to melt with the kyoto protocol officially taking effect early next year , the 10th annual un climate conference in buenos aires kicks off on a good note .
but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

23 , mikhail saakashvili burst into the parliament , leading the crowd holding a long-stemmed rose in his hand and prompting shevardnadze to flee the building .
is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .
press restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians read fresh newspapers to get to know results of presidential elections in tbilisi on jan .
5 , 2004 .
slowly but surely , the media is becoming the mouthpiece of the government , a development set to be consolidated by new press laws .
" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .
" i think -lrb- the president 's -rrb- desire for increased power and the constitutional changes he made were a clear expression of a new policy , " said opposition politician koba davitaschvili .
" it 's one step closer towards an authoritarian regime .

ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .
verteidigungsminister struck -lrb- spd -rrb- will gegen das kölner gerichtsurteil zur einberufungspraxis der bundeswehr rechtsmittel einlegen .
" ich bin nach wie vor der überzeugung , dass unser rechtsstandpunkt sich vor dem bundesverwaltungsgericht durchsetzen wird " , sagte struck am 23 .
april 2004 .
das verwaltungsgericht hatte entschieden , dass die derzeitige einberufungsregelung gegen das willkürverbot des grundgesetzes verstößt .
er empfinde die jetzige situation bei der einberufung " nicht als ungerecht " , so struck .

the issue of patriotism , long controversial in germany , will be a central plank of this week 's conservative pow-wow . analysts say the focus on these kinds of questions reflects their realization that internal struggles over questions of health reform and personnel have been damaging .
they 're now looking for common ground with which they can score points in the lead-up to the 2006 election . " we will send a signal of unity at the party congress , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers said last week .
" the time for internal debates is over . " fusty image the party will attempt to chart a new course following the resignation in october of merkel 's deputy parliamentary group leader and finance expert , friedrich merz , who walked out in a huff after a bitter power struggle . with the subsequent departure of the csu 's deputy parliamentary group leader horst seehofer over merkel 's health care reform scheme , the bloc is lacking high-profile figures who can sell its policies and connect with the public . in an internal report called " plea for a new direction , " parliamentary deputy julia klöckner , 31 , complained the party had an image as " cold , technocratic and dull " and was turning off city dwellers , families and young women . " the union does not embody their lifestyle , issues and does not speak their language , " she wrote in the report , quoted in the news magazine der spiegel . a survey this week by the independent polling institute forsa confirmed her view , showing that the christian union bloc 's support had dropped to 38 percent , far below the 50 percent it was garnering in march . schröder 's social democrats reached a respectable 32 percent , up from their historic low struck this summer of 23 percent . key state elections in schleswig-holstein in february and in north rhine-westphalia in may are fast approaching .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .
verteidigungsminister struck -lrb- spd -rrb- will gegen das kölner gerichtsurteil zur einberufungspraxis der bundeswehr rechtsmittel einlegen .
" ich bin nach wie vor der überzeugung , dass unser rechtsstandpunkt sich vor dem bundesverwaltungsgericht durchsetzen wird " , sagte struck am 23 .
april 2004 .
das verwaltungsgericht hatte entschieden , dass die derzeitige einberufungsregelung gegen das willkürverbot des grundgesetzes verstößt .
er empfinde die jetzige situation bei der einberufung " nicht als ungerecht " , so struck .
von den männern eines jahrgangs blieben für den wehrdienst nur etwa 35 prozent übrig , weil der rest verweigere oder aus gesundheitlichen gründen nicht eingezogen werden könne .
zur regelung , dass keine verheirateten und keine männer über 23 jahren mehr eingezogen werden , sei ein gesetzentwurf in arbeit .
the issue of patriotism , long controversial in germany , will be a central plank of this week 's conservative pow-wow . analysts say the focus on these kinds of questions reflects their realization that internal struggles over questions of health reform and personnel have been damaging .
they 're now looking for common ground with which they can score points in the lead-up to the 2006 election . " we will send a signal of unity at the party congress , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers said last week .
" the time for internal debates is over . " fusty image the party will attempt to chart a new course following the resignation in october of merkel 's deputy parliamentary group leader and finance expert , friedrich merz , who walked out in a huff after a bitter power struggle . with the subsequent departure of the csu 's deputy parliamentary group leader horst seehofer over merkel 's health care reform scheme , the bloc is lacking high-profile figures who can sell its policies and connect with the public . in an internal report called " plea for a new direction , " parliamentary deputy julia klöckner , 31 , complained the party had an image as " cold , technocratic and dull " and was turning off city dwellers , families and young women . " the union does not embody their lifestyle , issues and does not speak their language , " she wrote in the report , quoted in the news magazine der spiegel . a survey this week by the independent polling institute forsa confirmed her view , showing that the christian union bloc 's support had dropped to 38 percent , far below the 50 percent it was garnering in march . schröder 's social democrats reached a respectable 32 percent , up from their historic low struck this summer of 23 percent . key state elections in schleswig-holstein in february and in north rhine-westphalia in may are fast approaching .
both of them will be seen as tests for both schröder and merkel and both politicians know there is little time to lose . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scotches rumors of power struggle germany ’ s conservative party leader angela merkel has brushed aside allegations that some senior members of her christian democratic union are plotting against her in an effort to unseat her as party chairwoman .

the international jury honored weblogs in 11 categories and over 60,000 users voted to award user prizes in each of the categories . " if we ca n't talk about people than we 'll talk about dogs , " said the jury prize winner in the deutsche welle international weblog awards 2004 , the first international blog competition . deciding to honor " the dog newspaper " with the best weblog award from seven different languages was relatively easy for the best of the blogs - the bobs - jury members . put together with a collage style , the blog presents the unfair conditions suffered by dogs in china and asia compared to the treatment of animals in the western world . successful metaphor " the jury members saw the winning blog as a successful metaphor for the situation of people living in china and other nations , " said guido baumhauer , online editor-in-chief at deutsche welle and bobs organizer .
" the blog is a good example of weblogs bringing up an issue that is not tackled by the traditional media . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese erotic blogger star and bobs jury member mu zimei " the weblog can be understood as a parable , " chinese jury member mu zimei -lrb- photo -rrb- confirmed .
" the way dogs live is projected onto the lives of humans – dogs ’ rights onto human rights . " the rest of the bobs jury – which consisted of 10 representatives from seven languages – was convinced the " dog newspaper " best filled the tough criteria for the best weblog honors with its unique angle , its good use of design and well-written entries .
it also won a second award for best journalistic chinese blog . the blog 's creator , known only under his internet name of the " aggressive little snake , " said he was pleased to hear the results . " i did not expect to win the bobs , there are probably a lot of other people who are surprised as well , " said " little snake , " whom sponsors will present with a top-of-the-line notebook computer .
" i think my winning an award like this might encourage other bloggers . " english language winners the jury 's award for the best journalistic blog in english went to the " lessig blog . "
lawrence lessig uses his weblog to focus the public 's attention on digital media matters and also mentions political and social issues .
a law professor at stanford university , lessig was able to beat out stiff competition from some of the best-known blogs in the english language , such as " talking points memo " and " bloggerheads . " " editor : myself , " a weblog that examines the iranian government 's crack down on freedom of the press , won the english user award in the best journalistic blog category . large response in latin america the competition 's global perspective is what set it apart from other blog contests and meant it could produce a better picture of the international blog scene , baumhauer said at the end of a competition which included over 1,000 entries from around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury members did n't have too hard a time deciding on the best weblog award " the international jury was especially impressed with the numerous entries that came from spain and latin america , while interest from the english-speaking world was surprisingly low , " he added . the jury awarded the bob in the best topic category to the spanish weblog " el hombre que comía diccionarios " -lrb- the man who ate reference works -rrb- .
the blog 's snippets of random knowledge function as a " metaphor for internet culture , " said well-known spanish blogger and bobs jury member dr. josé luis orihuela . many languages , many blogs " the suggested blogs were of very high quality , " reported bobs jury member , dw-tv editor and german weblog veteran konstantin klein .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .
verteidigungsminister struck -lrb- spd -rrb- will gegen das kölner gerichtsurteil zur einberufungspraxis der bundeswehr rechtsmittel einlegen .

the issue of patriotism , long controversial in germany , will be a central plank of this week 's conservative pow-wow . analysts say the focus on these kinds of questions reflects their realization that internal struggles over questions of health reform and personnel have been damaging .
they 're now looking for common ground with which they can score points in the lead-up to the 2006 election . " we will send a signal of unity at the party congress , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers said last week .
" the time for internal debates is over . " fusty image the party will attempt to chart a new course following the resignation in october of merkel 's deputy parliamentary group leader and finance expert , friedrich merz , who walked out in a huff after a bitter power struggle . with the subsequent departure of the csu 's deputy parliamentary group leader horst seehofer over merkel 's health care reform scheme , the bloc is lacking high-profile figures who can sell its policies and connect with the public . in an internal report called " plea for a new direction , " parliamentary deputy julia klöckner , 31 , complained the party had an image as " cold , technocratic and dull " and was turning off city dwellers , families and young women . " the union does not embody their lifestyle , issues and does not speak their language , " she wrote in the report , quoted in the news magazine der spiegel . a survey this week by the independent polling institute forsa confirmed her view , showing that the christian union bloc 's support had dropped to 38 percent , far below the 50 percent it was garnering in march . schröder 's social democrats reached a respectable 32 percent , up from their historic low struck this summer of 23 percent . key state elections in schleswig-holstein in february and in north rhine-westphalia in may are fast approaching .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .

but there is still much work ahead to cut the output of greenhouse gases . invigorated by russia ’ s ratification of the kyoto protocol on global warming , environmentalists are convening in the argentine capital from dec .
6 to 17 to discuss the future of climate change .
the treaty , which becomes legally binding in february 2005 , opens the way for reining in human activities that are gradually contributing to a change in the earth ’ s climate system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal burning heaters increase emission levels the framework , negotiated in 1997 and held in limbo until russian president vladimir putin signed the protocol in november , is the world ’ s most ambitious and complex environmental accord .
ratified by 150 nations , it legally commits wealthy countries to trimming outputs of six greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by at least 5.2 percent by 2012 , compared with 1990 levels . an impossible goal ? but given the fact that the overall level of emissions in the majority of wealthy countries has soared since the protocol was first drafted seven years ago in kyoto , japan , very few signatories will be able to meet the 2012 pledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog is a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air the 15 original european union members , for instance , had agreed to an ambitious reduction plan to cut back their greenhouse gases by an average of eight percent by 2012 compared to their output in 1990 .
as of 2002 , however , they had only managed to trim the emissions by 2.9 percent . limited impact despite all its diplomatic importance , the treaty will only have a minimal impact on improving the climate .
the gases it regulates , products primarily of burning oil , gas and coal , can linger on in the atmosphere for hundreds of years , and are already heating up the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories in germany environmental scientists say that reduction levels of around 60 percent are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic damage to the world ’ s biosphere .
but given the fact that the five-percent benchmark is already too high for many countries , a greater reduction seems illusory . in addition , many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , such as india and china , are currently not included in the first phase of the commitment period which runs until 2012 .
yet these are also the countries which recorded a significant increase in emissions since the treaty was originally drawn up in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing is one of the world 's most polluted cities only once the second commitment period enters force after 2012 will china and india , which together account for about 40 percent of global emissions , be required to begin curbing their pollutants .
unless they begin implementing drastic cuts , the two asian powerhouses are expected to overtake all current industrialized nations in greenhouse gas output by 2025 , according to the international atomic energy agency . american opposition the united states , currently the world ’ s biggest polluter with an output of a quarter of all global co2 emissions , has repeatedly refused to sign the treaty .
in march 2001 , in one of his first acts after taking office , president george w. bush said his country , despite having signed the 1997 draft agreement , would not ratify the protocol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at a greenpeace rally on earth day in washington april 18 , 2001 .
bush said the cost of meeting kyoto ’ s commitments would be too high for the us economy , calling the treaty " unfair " because only industrialized countries had to make targeted emissions cuts . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party and a strong advocate of the kyoto protocol , criticized the united states for its refusal to cut emissions to a responsible level . “ it simply can not be that a us citizen with the comparable living standard of a european citizen produces two and a half times as many greenhouse gases , ” he said in an interview with a radio station in berlin-brandenburg on monday . with the world ’ s highest per capita emission rates , the us should feel morally obligated to cutting greenhouse gases and setting itself up as a responsible model for the world , trittin said , adding that he did not expect washington to sign the treaty as long as bush is in the white house . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

some are disappointed by the lack of progress . as ukraine begins preparing for a new election after its highest court last week annulled a rigged poll , the supporters of liberal opposition leader viktor yushchenko have been looking to the peaceful " rose revolution " in georgia last year as a beacon of hope - an inspiring symbol of what " people 's power " can effect . a bloodless coup after ruling georgia for almost 30 years , shevardnadze 's government claimed in 2003 it had won a parliamentary election .
mass street protests ensued , gaining momentum until thousands of people demanded his resignation , tired of the rampant corruption and widespread poverty which prevailed under the shevardnadze regime .

is the honeymoon over ?
but delivering on the promises he made in those heady days has proved difficult .
twelve months on , even some of his staunchest supporters feel disappointed .
" before we decide on any system , there must be public consultations with professionals on what is good for georgia - not just swift decision-making and adoption of a system which will fail , " anna dolidze , who heads the georgian young lawyers ' association , a group critical of the turns the country is taking , told deutsche welle .
" with most of the issues , that 's the case , " she added .
" but some ideas are formed , decisions taken swiftly , with to little public consultation . "
dolidze and many others would like to see livelier public debate .
" all the experts can do is sit down and provide critique of measures already taken , which is of course not as productive , " she said .
in this respect , according to the critics , saakashvili is little better than shevardnadze .
a democracy is based on public participation in choosing a country 's direction , with - for example - a strong parliament , referendums , lobby groups and press freedom .
but today , many journalists accuse the young president of censoring the media - something his predecessor never did . now , anyone who asks uncomfortable questions risks losing their accreditation .

" take the licensing system of regular commercial media , " dolidze said .
" before , if you got a license and you did n't violate the licensing terms flagrantly , it was prolonged automatically till eternity .
that was a guarantee of independence .
but now , according to a new initiative , after 10 years , competition has to be announced concerning each and every license .
that 's a very good norm in western terms - we understand that it supports transparency and open competition .
but it would n't work as it should in georgia . " the new committee in charge of issuing licenses will be dominated by the president and parliament .
politicians will have every opportunity to exert pressure on the media , filtering out critical voices in the run-up to elections , for example , by threatening not to renew licenses set to expire . " this method would be a very good tool for the government to control how the media behaves - even though it was explained in very kind terms , saying that there is a transparency needed in media ownership , " dolidze said .
a one-party state ?
when saakashvili 's national movement-democratic front received over 78 percent of the vote in march this year , taking all the seats in parliament , the result gave rise to fears that georgia could become a one-party state .
he then began introducing constitutional amendments including a presidential right to disband parliament .
critics insist the changes enhance executive authority at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches of government .

from carmakers such as daimlerchrysler , bmw and volkswagen to electronics giant siemens , many have invested a good deal in the country by opening up factories and hope that the investments will pay off with strong dividends in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a volkswagen car in china as a result , a delegation of 50 top-notch industrial leaders are accompanying the chancellor and pinpointing ways germany can improve its economic ties to the vast chinese market . trains , planes and automobiles the chancellor seems to have taken their advice to heart . “ china ’ s economy is growing in a very dynamic way , " schröder told reporters at the inauguration of a production site for daimlerchrysler ag on monday .
" everybody can see that .
one of the core parts of this growth is the automotive industry . ” the carmaker , which is one of the leading german companies in china , is expecting to sell 50,000 cars annually in the people ’ s republic over the next five to 10 years and will start rolling out the first of a planed 80,00 chinese-made mercedes starting next year . volkswagen ag , which has been turning out cars in the country for several years , is considered china ’ s largest single carmaker .
on tuesday schröder will open the wolfsburg-based company ’ s third factory in china – a billion-euro investment – in the north eastern industrial city of changchun . but cars aren ’ t the only german product in demand in china .
the head of industrial conglomerate siemens , heinrich von pierer , is expected to announce an order by china for 180 locomotives worth up to € 360 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-storied airbus a380 is being called the " first jet of the 21st century " aircraft manufacturer airbus , meanwhile is set to unveil a deal worth up to € 1 billion to supply 23 of its a319 and a330 jets to chinese airlines .
a purchase order for the european consortium ’ s future a380 super-jumbo planes , however , still has not been completely worked out . the wall street journal reported last week that beijing was holding up the deal because of the european union ’ s refusal to lift a 15-year-old ban on arms sales to china .
but chinese vice foreign minister zhang yesui last week dismissed such reports , saying china still needed the planes for its developing tourism industry . arms embargo the question of lifting the eu arms embargo to china , however , still has not been decided , despite strong lobbying by germany and france to have it removed . the ban , slapped on beijing in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , has been a key issue in recent political negotiations between china and the european bloc .
on wednesday a china-eu summit will take place in the hague , and many are expecting the embargo to be the key focus of discussion . chancellor schröder told xinhua news agency his government would “ strive for a consensus to be reached as early as possible ” on lifting the sanction .
while the german leader has made no secret out of his opposition to the ban , the german parliament voted at the end of october for the embargo to be kept in place .

several eu members have cited china ’ s poor human rights record as a chief concern in lifting the arms embargo and china has sought to enlist schröder and french president jacques chirac ’ s help to allay those fears . in the past , schröder has pressed for the lifting of the ban in discussions with other eu leaders , and chirac , who was in china in october , referred to the embargo as a “ relic ” of the past and said it was high-time the eu voted to remove it . " this is a very solemn , serious political issue , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday .
" we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " the ban is “ incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership ” and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , zhang added . china , which is unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe , and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from the likely lucrative trade . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor under fire over china arms ban german chancellor gerhard schröder came under criticism on saturday for favoring the lifting of the european arms embargo on china against the wishes of the german and european parliaments .

from carmakers such as daimlerchrysler , bmw and volkswagen to electronics giant siemens , many have invested a good deal in the country by opening up factories and hope that the investments will pay off with strong dividends in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past a volkswagen car in china as a result , a delegation of 50 top-notch industrial leaders are accompanying the chancellor and pinpointing ways germany can improve its economic ties to the vast chinese market . trains , planes and automobiles the chancellor seems to have taken their advice to heart . “ china ’ s economy is growing in a very dynamic way , " schröder told reporters at the inauguration of a production site for daimlerchrysler ag on monday .
" everybody can see that .
one of the core parts of this growth is the automotive industry . ” the carmaker , which is one of the leading german companies in china , is expecting to sell 50,000 cars annually in the people ’ s republic over the next five to 10 years and will start rolling out the first of a planed 80,00 chinese-made mercedes starting next year . volkswagen ag , which has been turning out cars in the country for several years , is considered china ’ s largest single carmaker .
on tuesday schröder will open the wolfsburg-based company ’ s third factory in china – a billion-euro investment – in the north eastern industrial city of changchun . but cars aren ’ t the only german product in demand in china .
the head of industrial conglomerate siemens , heinrich von pierer , is expected to announce an order by china for 180 locomotives worth up to € 360 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two-storied airbus a380 is being called the " first jet of the 21st century " aircraft manufacturer airbus , meanwhile is set to unveil a deal worth up to € 1 billion to supply 23 of its a319 and a330 jets to chinese airlines .
a purchase order for the european consortium ’ s future a380 super-jumbo planes , however , still has not been completely worked out . the wall street journal reported last week that beijing was holding up the deal because of the european union ’ s refusal to lift a 15-year-old ban on arms sales to china .
but chinese vice foreign minister zhang yesui last week dismissed such reports , saying china still needed the planes for its developing tourism industry . arms embargo the question of lifting the eu arms embargo to china , however , still has not been decided , despite strong lobbying by germany and france to have it removed . the ban , slapped on beijing in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , has been a key issue in recent political negotiations between china and the european bloc .
on wednesday a china-eu summit will take place in the hague , and many are expecting the embargo to be the key focus of discussion . chancellor schröder told xinhua news agency his government would “ strive for a consensus to be reached as early as possible ” on lifting the sanction .
while the german leader has made no secret out of his opposition to the ban , the german parliament voted at the end of october for the embargo to be kept in place .
the european parliament in strasbourg also voted against revoking it in mid-november . human rights record to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and chinese prime minister wen jiabao at a meeting in berlin on monday , may 3 , 2004 .
several eu members have cited china ’ s poor human rights record as a chief concern in lifting the arms embargo and china has sought to enlist schröder and french president jacques chirac ’ s help to allay those fears . in the past , schröder has pressed for the lifting of the ban in discussions with other eu leaders , and chirac , who was in china in october , referred to the embargo as a “ relic ” of the past and said it was high-time the eu voted to remove it . " this is a very solemn , serious political issue , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday .
" we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " the ban is “ incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership ” and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , zhang added . china , which is unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe , and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from the likely lucrative trade . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor under fire over china arms ban german chancellor gerhard schröder came under criticism on saturday for favoring the lifting of the european arms embargo on china against the wishes of the german and european parliaments .

she needs to salvage sinking support for her christian union bloc and shore up her own run for the chancellery in 2006 . merkel , who became head of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2000 in the wake of a party financing investigation targeting her mentor , former chancellor helmut kohl , has always been an odd match for her party . as a protestant woman from the ex-communist east who has been divorced , she does not fit the profile of the solidly western , exclusively male , often roman catholic leaders who have led the party since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel as work of art .
merkel , 50 , is frequently compared to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the press for her ambition to become germany 's first female leader . but merkel has watched her party 's overwhelming lead over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats evaporate in recent months , thanks to a series of gaffes and repeated sniping from her male rivals . the two-day congress in the western city of düsseldorf will give merkel a chance to focus on the hot-button issues preoccupying voters : the stagnant economy and what she calls the " failed " vision of a multicultural society . the party will table a motion called " in german interest : encouraging integration , fighting islamism " calling for more integration courses for foreigners and sanctions for newcomers who refuse to participate . we 're all friends again merkel has already begun putting on a show of partnership with edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and her chief rival for the 2006 nomination as chancellor candidate , by penning a letter with him which was sent to chancellor schröder over the weekend opposing turkey 's entry into the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with edmund stoiber in the letter , she and stoiber reiterated the christian bloc 's opposition to turkey joining the eu - a view shared by a substantial percentage of the population - and renewed calls for a " privileged partnership " with the mainly muslim country . they said that turkey 's entry would " overstretch " the eu . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , which published extracts from the letter , said the two leaders wanted the document to be seen as a sign of unity ahead of the party meeting .
a major goal is to show the public that past differences with its sister party over other policy and leadership issues have been resolved . focus on values as approval ratings for the conservatives have dropped and the once comfortable goal of winning the next federal election in 2006 has been put at risk , conservatives are shifting their center slightly , moving away from nuts and bolts discussions of policy to the softer issue of " values . " the term and debate around a german leitkultur , or " guiding culture , " has surfaced again and led to accusations that the cdu is pandering to anti-foreigner fears , especially as the question over the integration of the nation 's muslim minority has come into sharp focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein soldat der bundeswehr salutiert , während vor ihm die deutsche fahne weht -lrb- aufgenommen am 23.4.2004 in speyer -rrb- .
verteidigungsminister struck -lrb- spd -rrb- will gegen das kölner gerichtsurteil zur einberufungspraxis der bundeswehr rechtsmittel einlegen .
" ich bin nach wie vor der überzeugung , dass unser rechtsstandpunkt sich vor dem bundesverwaltungsgericht durchsetzen wird " , sagte struck am 23 .
april 2004 .
das verwaltungsgericht hatte entschieden , dass die derzeitige einberufungsregelung gegen das willkürverbot des grundgesetzes verstößt .
er empfinde die jetzige situation bei der einberufung " nicht als ungerecht " , so struck .
von den männern eines jahrgangs blieben für den wehrdienst nur etwa 35 prozent übrig , weil der rest verweigere oder aus gesundheitlichen gründen nicht eingezogen werden könne .
zur regelung , dass keine verheirateten und keine männer über 23 jahren mehr eingezogen werden , sei ein gesetzentwurf in arbeit .
the issue of patriotism , long controversial in germany , will be a central plank of this week 's conservative pow-wow . analysts say the focus on these kinds of questions reflects their realization that internal struggles over questions of health reform and personnel have been damaging .
they 're now looking for common ground with which they can score points in the lead-up to the 2006 election . " we will send a signal of unity at the party congress , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers said last week .
" the time for internal debates is over . " fusty image the party will attempt to chart a new course following the resignation in october of merkel 's deputy parliamentary group leader and finance expert , friedrich merz , who walked out in a huff after a bitter power struggle . with the subsequent departure of the csu 's deputy parliamentary group leader horst seehofer over merkel 's health care reform scheme , the bloc is lacking high-profile figures who can sell its policies and connect with the public . in an internal report called " plea for a new direction , " parliamentary deputy julia klöckner , 31 , complained the party had an image as " cold , technocratic and dull " and was turning off city dwellers , families and young women . " the union does not embody their lifestyle , issues and does not speak their language , " she wrote in the report , quoted in the news magazine der spiegel . a survey this week by the independent polling institute forsa confirmed her view , showing that the christian union bloc 's support had dropped to 38 percent , far below the 50 percent it was garnering in march . schröder 's social democrats reached a respectable 32 percent , up from their historic low struck this summer of 23 percent . key state elections in schleswig-holstein in february and in north rhine-westphalia in may are fast approaching .
both of them will be seen as tests for both schröder and merkel and both politicians know there is little time to lose . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scotches rumors of power struggle germany ’ s conservative party leader angela merkel has brushed aside allegations that some senior members of her christian democratic union are plotting against her in an effort to unseat her as party chairwoman .

the national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- said an interim report on the scheme found it was affordable and could be implemented within six years .
it said it would benefit millions of pensioners , particularly women , and would be cheaper to administer .
it said the scheme would also be simpler for people to understand .
the beauty of the citizen 's pension lies in its simplicity christine farnish napf chief executive the citizen 's pension study was conducted by napf and the pensions policy institute -lrb- ppi -rrb- .
under the plan , the present system of state payments would be replaced with a universal payment starting at £ 105 per week and rising with earnings .
eligibility would be based on residency , rather than work record and national insurance contributions .
most means testing would be removed and " contracting out " of the state pension would no longer be allowed .
immediate benefit the scheme would be of immediate benefit to around eight million pensioners who currently receive less than £ 105 a week from the state , the napf said .
richard scott , of bbc radio five live 's money programme , said napf claimed it would particularly benefit women , who often miss out on the full basic state pension because bringing up children stops them making enough national insurance contributions .
napf chief executive christine farnish said the citizen 's pension would fix britain 's " horrendously complicated " system .
" the beauty of the citizen 's pension lies in its simplicity .
the state will provide £ 105 a week and any saving you do on top of that is yours .
" immediately , the deal from the state is clear .
anyone wanting a better income in retirement understands the need to make additional saving , either through a workplace pension or some other means . "
long-term costs the report found the new system could be implemented by 2010 and would cost no more than the amount currently spent by the government on pensions .
pensioners rallied in august for higher payments however the long-term costs of the scheme could require measures such as cutting government spending in other areas , raising taxes or national insurance contributions or lifting the state pension age .
the report said such measures would be required eventually under the current system as well .
ppi director alison o 'connell , who worked on the study , said the transition to a new system would require careful planning , but that such a change would ease public concern .
" the report shows that a citizen 's pension , while not without some concerns , would be possible and could also have real advantages for state , occupational and personal pensions .
" we know from previous research that what people want above all else is a simple pension system , and a citizen 's pension would achieve that . "
the report also said a state pension review board should be established to advise the government on pensions and a cross-party agreement on the principles of pension policy should be drafted .
the study is open to public consultation before a final report on the plan is released .

under the plan , the present system of state payments would be replaced with a universal payment starting at £ 105 per week and rising with earnings .
eligibility would be based on residency , rather than work record and national insurance contributions .
most means testing would be removed and " contracting out " of the state pension would no longer be allowed .
immediate benefit the scheme would be of immediate benefit to around eight million pensioners who currently receive less than £ 105 a week from the state , the napf said .
richard scott , of bbc radio five live 's money programme , said napf claimed it would particularly benefit women , who often miss out on the full basic state pension because bringing up children stops them making enough national insurance contributions .
napf chief executive christine farnish said the citizen 's pension would fix britain 's " horrendously complicated " system .
" the beauty of the citizen 's pension lies in its simplicity .
the state will provide £ 105 a week and any saving you do on top of that is yours .
" immediately , the deal from the state is clear .
anyone wanting a better income in retirement understands the need to make additional saving , either through a workplace pension or some other means . "
long-term costs the report found the new system could be implemented by 2010 and would cost no more than the amount currently spent by the government on pensions .
pensioners rallied in august for higher payments however the long-term costs of the scheme could require measures such as cutting government spending in other areas , raising taxes or national insurance contributions or lifting the state pension age .
the report said such measures would be required eventually under the current system as well .
ppi director alison o 'connell , who worked on the study , said the transition to a new system would require careful planning , but that such a change would ease public concern .
" the report shows that a citizen 's pension , while not without some concerns , would be possible and could also have real advantages for state , occupational and personal pensions .
" we know from previous research that what people want above all else is a simple pension system , and a citizen 's pension would achieve that . "
the report also said a state pension review board should be established to advise the government on pensions and a cross-party agreement on the principles of pension policy should be drafted .
the study is open to public consultation before a final report on the plan is released .

sir john mogg , chairman of ofgem , has written to energy providers and the government urging " more co-ordinated action " over combating fuel poverty .
new research published by the regulator suggests many vulnerable customers are unaware of the help available to them .
sir john wants more suppliers to develop tariffs aimed at low-income and vulnerable customers .
low-income households are expected to struggle with energy bills this winter , because of rising prices .
most energy firms have increased prices more than once over the last year , citing rising oil prices and depleting uk natural resources .
once a net exporter of gas and oil , the uk is on the brink of becoming a net importer in the next year or two for the first time since north sea oil was discovered in the 1970s .
by 2015 , it is forecast that 75 % of the uk 's gas requirements will need to be imported , which is expected to push up prices further .
knowledge gap ofgem 's research suggests that less than a fifth of customers who could have taken up help to make their homes more energy efficient have done so .
there should be greater co-ordination sir john mogg , ofgem and three-quarters of vulnerable customers have not heard of the priority services register , a free service which can help pensioners and disabled people save money on bills and ensure they are treated with care .
priority services register the register is a list of elderly , disabled -lrb- including customers who are blind or partially sighted , deaf or hard of hearing -rrb- and chronically ill customers , who may need additional help each domestic electricity and gas supplier is obliged to maintain a register of these people and offer special help to customers benefits include " easy read " bills , a scheme to deter bogus callers , and priority reconnection after a power cut source : ofgem changing energy supplier disconnections - know your rights although the government has set targets to cut fuel poverty , energy firms are not obliged to offer widespread support to vulnerable users , although many do .
sir john said ofgem would be carrying out an audit of what help companies are currently offering , which it expects to publish early next year .
an ofgem spokesman insisted this would not be a " naming and shaming exercise " but would highlight good practice within the industry .
" there should be greater co-ordination among all organisations - ourselves , suppliers , the government and voluntary bodies - in helping customers most in need , " said sir john .
" i have seen at first hand the differences that can be made in the home when help is targeted in the right way . "
consumer action the regulator and consumer watchdog energywatch recently launched a campaign called " energy smart " to encourage gas and electricity consumers to beat this winter 's rising energy prices .
the campaign estimates customers can make significant savings by following a few simple steps .
as well as making typical savings of up to £ 100 a year for switching supplier , customers save about £ 20 a year if they switch their payment method - from cheque or cash to direct debit .
customers or their carers are being urged to contact their energy suppliers for details and help .
factsheets can also be obtained from the websites of ofgem and energywatch .

recent findings have shown that many drivers feel they will not be caught drink driving .
but lothian and borders police said its research revealed that , in a four-month period , 420 drivers were arrested resulting in 654 years of driving bans .
all eight scottish forces are beginning their festive drink drive crackdowns .
despite a scottish executive survey which revealed many motorists believed they could avoid being caught drink driving , the lothian and borders force said the facts showed something different .
since august , officers have been monitoring those caught drinking and driving and the outcome of their court cases .
my advice to any motorist who is prepared to drive after taking drink or drugs is do n't risk it as the consequences can be far reaching pat docherty strathclyde police a total of 105 motorists were arrested every month and 482 high profile road checks were carried out equivalent to four every day .
charles michie , assistant chief constable of lothian and borders police , said the research revealed that drink drivers would be caught .
he said : " the executive findings were worrying as they showed that many motorists felt they would not be caught if they drove under the influence of alcohol .
" however , detailed research by lothian and borders police has robustly demonstrated that this is not the case .
" police officers are out arresting drink drivers round the clock , every day of the year .
no one is exempt from the police catching them and putting them to court . "
at the launch of strathclyde police 's campaign , chief inspector pat docherty had a strong warning for those considering drinking and driving .
police stress that the penalties can be severe he said : " my advice to any motorist who is prepared to drive after taking drink or drugs is do n't risk it as the consequences can be far reaching .
" conviction means an automatic ban , so i would urge drivers to consider the effect losing their licence would have on their work and social life .
" this applies equally to ' morning after ' drivers , who may think a few hours ' sleep negates the effect of drink or drugs . "
both officers stressed drivers under the influence put lives at risk and the ultimate sentence could be having to live with causing a death .
completely anonymous mr michie said public had an important part to play in this year 's campaign by contacting the police if they were aware of drink drivers he added that the public could also use the crimestoppers number on 0800 555 111 with calls completely anonymous and free .
the campaign will be promoted through radio adverts , on buses , posters and beer mats .
one recent drink drive case involved a woman driver travelling on the a68 in midlothian without her lights on .
when she stopped in a dangerous position on the carriageway , members of the public went over to the car to discover the woman driver to be drunk .
they took the car keys from her and contacted police .
she was later found to be three-and-a-half times over the limit .

opinion polls had suggested new political and citizens groups were set to pose a stiff challenge to traditional parties .
the new groups emerged in the wake of last year 's huge protests at government plans to export bolivia 's natural gas .
they argued such a vital natural resource should remain in bolivia to benefit everyone , not just the elite .
about four million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election to choose mayors and councillors in the country 's 327 municipalities .
opposition gains unofficial results based on about 80 % of the ballots showed candidates from indigenous and peasant organisations winning in major cities .
" these results are tantamount to the sinking of the traditional political parties , " political scientist jorge lazarte told the associated press news agency .
while local elections do not usually arouse much excitement , any test of democracy is always watched closely in politically unstable bolivia , says the bbc 's south america correspondent elliott gotkine .
" we will probably see a reshuffle of our political map , " said bolivian president carlos mesa after casting his vote as polls opened .
evo morales is now a key figure on the political stage he urged people to vote to " find the best men and women " to serve on local councils .
mr mesa himself came to power just over a year ago after a popular revolt left around 80 people dead and forced the then president to resign .
mr mesa , whose term in office ends in 2007 , has since brought a measure of stability to bolivia .
left-wing opposition politician evo morales , leader of bolivia 's coca growers and a key figure in last year 's protests , was expected to use the municipal elections as a springboard for his presidential ambitions .
his movement towards socialism -lrb- mas -rrb- was expected to win about a quarter of the vote .
our correspondent says this is largely because many of its rivals , which have dominated the political scene for decades , are discredited by corruption or their support for unpopular economic policies .
the new groups campaign mostly on issues they say are crucial to bolivians , such as cleaner streets , more access to health and education and better transport .

it follows a public meeting in october at which boat crews reported sailing through raw sewage off the kent coast .
the meeting in broadstairs on monday evening will be attended by thanet district council , southern water and the environment agency .
an investigation is under way into why the samples failed two tests in august .
defective sewers southern water has said no waste water is discharged into viking bay .
it is investigating other causes for the failure , such as whether contamination occurred as a result of faulty drainage ducts or defective sewers .
a council spokesman said southern water and the environment agency had responsibility for waste water , while the council was responsible for drains .
an environment agency statement said bathing water in england and wales was monitored weekly through the summer and judged on two sets of standards within a european commission directive on bathing water quality .
twenty samples were taken at viking bay , of which two failed the bathing water standard this year .
the meeting will take place at 1900 gmt in the pavilion in broadstairs .

if approved by states members , the 5 % tax could be added to goods and services in jersey as early as 2007 .
it is designed to plug holes in government finances caused by zero-rate corporation tax to encourage businesses to remain on the island .
but ernst and young tax director john shenton said he believed uncertainty over it could unsettle some companies .
other measures part of the reason the zero-rate corporation tax is being introduced is to keep the finance industry in jersey at a time of strong competition from other offshore financial centres as low tax areas .
mr shenton said he wanted to know whether any financial services or products would be taxed with the new levy .
he said that some sectors , such as securities , which were initially attracted to jersey because there was not such a tax , could be driven away .
the states has been previously told that other measures , such as a capital gains tax or company tax , would not raise enough money to fill the gap and could damage the economy .

bulldozers started tearing down the prime site overlooking the bristol channel last week .
by easter they will have razed to the ground the old blue lagoon swimming pool , the bars , theatres and canteen which have provided holiday entertainment for so many happy campers down the years .
now what is left of the camp - the old world war ii emergency army accommodation , which became the campers ' chalets , were demolished in favour of private homes a decade ago - looks destined to be transformed into a tourism college .
sir billy butlin allegedly had the idea for his holiday camps which provided the annual-two-week escape for so many in britain through the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s after he stayed at a b & b at barry island .
the camp regularly entertained up to 7,000 holidaymakers a week , soaking up visitors looking for two weeks of entertainment from the south wales valleys and beyond .
but the enthusiasm among some of those who worked there still remains high and a reunion for former barry butlins staff is being held next 5 november at trecco bay , in porthcawl .
holidaymakers packed barry island beach in the camp 's heyday " it 's the last old fashioned holiday camp " said simon warry , himself a veteran of the ice cream parlour , and now organiser of next year 's reunion .
" theme parks are so commercial now . "
fellow bluecoat debbie bunce remembers warmly the two april-to-october seasons she spent entertaining the families who flocked to the south wales resort .
" it was just like a family .
we got paid absolutely rubbish money - £ 92 a week - and worked 15 hours a day , but it was just so great . "
she said she recently returned to look through the gates of the camp - it closed its doors in 1996 - with a teenager who she had looked after at the camp when she had holidayed there with her family .
" she just burst into tears - the memories meant so much to her , " said ms bunce , who is now a student radio presenter .
asbestos john cuddy , joint managing director of the llandarcy-based company which is carrying out the demolition work , said the £ 380,000 contract , said " size wise it 's not big for us " .
" but this is a bit different .
we rarely get the opportunity top demolish a leisure complex because most of them are so new . "
between 150 to 200 tonnes of asbestos have to be removed from site during the demolition which will have 25 workers involved at its peak .
" i think the main issue will be to prevent the public and those who have an interest in it from getting on the site " said mr cuddy .
the old chalet accommodation was demolished four or five years ago , he said , making way for houses with commanding views across the channel .
now the vale of glamorgan council which owns the barry island resort site is in talks to transform the rest of the site into a tourism and leisure management college , run by uwic , the university of wales institute , cardiff .
mike harvey , the council 's cabinet member for economic regeneration , tourism and leisure , said uwic was planning to relocate its existing college from colchester avenue , cardiff in a £ 20m project .
" we are working with other partners , like the welsh development agency in order that they can develop a college here . "
however , mr harvey said the project still had a funding gap and if the college could not relocate to the old holiday camp site , the authority would have to investigate other options .
" we want employment here , that has always been our objective .

bulldozers started tearing down the prime site overlooking the bristol channel last week .
by easter they will have razed to the ground the old blue lagoon swimming pool , the bars , theatres and canteen which have provided holiday entertainment for so many happy campers down the years .
now what is left of the camp - the old world war ii emergency army accommodation , which became the campers ' chalets , were demolished in favour of private homes a decade ago - looks destined to be transformed into a tourism college .
sir billy butlin allegedly had the idea for his holiday camps which provided the annual-two-week escape for so many in britain through the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s after he stayed at a b & b at barry island .
the camp regularly entertained up to 7,000 holidaymakers a week , soaking up visitors looking for two weeks of entertainment from the south wales valleys and beyond .
but the enthusiasm among some of those who worked there still remains high and a reunion for former barry butlins staff is being held next 5 november at trecco bay , in porthcawl .
holidaymakers packed barry island beach in the camp 's heyday " it 's the last old fashioned holiday camp " said simon warry , himself a veteran of the ice cream parlour , and now organiser of next year 's reunion .
" theme parks are so commercial now . "
fellow bluecoat debbie bunce remembers warmly the two april-to-october seasons she spent entertaining the families who flocked to the south wales resort .
" it was just like a family .
we got paid absolutely rubbish money - £ 92 a week - and worked 15 hours a day , but it was just so great . "
she said she recently returned to look through the gates of the camp - it closed its doors in 1996 - with a teenager who she had looked after at the camp when she had holidayed there with her family .
" she just burst into tears - the memories meant so much to her , " said ms bunce , who is now a student radio presenter .
asbestos john cuddy , joint managing director of the llandarcy-based company which is carrying out the demolition work , said the £ 380,000 contract , said " size wise it 's not big for us " .
" but this is a bit different .
we rarely get the opportunity top demolish a leisure complex because most of them are so new . "
between 150 to 200 tonnes of asbestos have to be removed from site during the demolition which will have 25 workers involved at its peak .
" i think the main issue will be to prevent the public and those who have an interest in it from getting on the site " said mr cuddy .
the old chalet accommodation was demolished four or five years ago , he said , making way for houses with commanding views across the channel .
now the vale of glamorgan council which owns the barry island resort site is in talks to transform the rest of the site into a tourism and leisure management college , run by uwic , the university of wales institute , cardiff .
mike harvey , the council 's cabinet member for economic regeneration , tourism and leisure , said uwic was planning to relocate its existing college from colchester avenue , cardiff in a £ 20m project .
" we are working with other partners , like the welsh development agency in order that they can develop a college here . "
however , mr harvey said the project still had a funding gap and if the college could not relocate to the old holiday camp site , the authority would have to investigate other options .
" we want employment here , that has always been our objective .
but if we ca n't get it through a college we will have to look at other options " .
