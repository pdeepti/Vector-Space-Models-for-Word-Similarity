chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .

french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .

with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .

francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .
" it ’ s difficult there -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- to talk about weaknesses in our own work .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 france slashes unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in germany , the chronically unemployed are the target in france .
french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .
“ that said , it ’ s good news to see mister chirac is finally making jobs the priority for 2004 . ” dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leads mediation talks on reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .

convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 eu split over sky marshals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the real thing : a u.s. sky marshal in a mock hijacking attempt .
a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .

many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .

as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.01.2004 germany grapples with bse scare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : careful does it .
as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .
" it ’ s difficult there -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- to talk about weaknesses in our own work .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 france slashes unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in germany , the chronically unemployed are the target in france .
french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .
“ that said , it ’ s good news to see mister chirac is finally making jobs the priority for 2004 . ” dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leads mediation talks on reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .

many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .

slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2004 airbus overtakes boeing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus parent eads is also gaining ground .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 france slashes unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in germany , the chronically unemployed are the target in france .
french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 08.01.2004 are german universities losing their luster ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's students are facing hard times .
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .

a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .

“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc blair wants to take uk into euro by 2007 in order to secure this ambition , blair wants the government to make a public pledge that the great britain will join the common monetary union .
according to the london-based independent , blair intends to call for the referendum soon after the country ’ s next general election , which is expected to take place in may or june next year .
but not all cabinet members endorse the move .
in particular , chancellor gordon brown is believed to be strongly against the idea of a public announcement .
he is allegedly concerned that such a declaration would prejudge the economic analysis his department is conducting on membership in the euro zone .
in june last year , brown rejected introducing the single currency in the near future , saying that only one of his famous ' five tests ' had been met .
since then , the issue has been buried , and most experts regard a referendum in the next few years as unlikely .
but blair ’ s persistent tactics show that he has not abandoned his goal of cashing in the pound for the euro .
britain , denmark and sweden are the only three eu countries that remain outside the single currency zone .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .
" we have to banish danger on the ground , " he said .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .

although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable .

shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights .

" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital . german interior minister otto schily will soon have a better eye on those supposed to keep tabs on everybody else . with the aim of concentrating germany ’ s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies near the government , schily on wednesday announced the bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , the country ’ s federal police force , would move from two western locations to berlin by 2008 . “ the concentration of a number of operational units to one location and the grouping of police competence makes sense organizationally and is justified due to the increased challenges from the fight against international terrorism , ” schily said . only last autumn , germany ’ s main foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , announced it would move to berlin from the sleepy town of pullach outside of munich to be closer to important decision-making in the capital .
although germany has a long tradition of placing federal agencies throughout the country , many officials like schily feel a more centralized security apparatus would be better suited to the tackling the threats of a post-sept .

and schily may have enough on his plate contending with unhappy bka officials , who have begun to complain about the relocation plans . klaus jansen , head of a german law enforcement association , told the associated press that there was no professional reason to move the bka to berlin and that relocating the agency could actually have a negative effect on morale . “ what we need is a highly-motivated police force especially in light of the current challenges , ” jansen said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism alarm in hamburg german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .

to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .
the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital . german interior minister otto schily will soon have a better eye on those supposed to keep tabs on everybody else . with the aim of concentrating germany ’ s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies near the government , schily on wednesday announced the bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , the country ’ s federal police force , would move from two western locations to berlin by 2008 . “ the concentration of a number of operational units to one location and the grouping of police competence makes sense organizationally and is justified due to the increased challenges from the fight against international terrorism , ” schily said . only last autumn , germany ’ s main foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , announced it would move to berlin from the sleepy town of pullach outside of munich to be closer to important decision-making in the capital .
although germany has a long tradition of placing federal agencies throughout the country , many officials like schily feel a more centralized security apparatus would be better suited to the tackling the threats of a post-sept .
11 world . bka will still have two centers the bka presently is based in wiesbaden near frankfurt , with a small branch in meckenheim near germany ’ s former capital bonn .
now , by pushing for the unexpected relocation of the agency , schily has made clear he wants to improve the government ’ s crisis management ability by having key law enforcement authorities within his reach as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kersten , president of the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .
the bka ’ s berlin office , currently with a staff of 500 , will this year increase by 300 .
bka director ulrich kersten -lrb- photo -rrb- and the entire directorate will complete their move by 2006 .
but around half of the agency ’ s total 5,000 employees will stay in wiesbaden , which will remain an important center for information technology , research , administration and education . domestic intelligence still in cologne the decision to bring the bka also to berlin leaves only one other important security agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- in cologne in western germany , far away from the federal government .
whereas the bnd is involved in foreign intelligence gathering , the bfv is germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency , focusing primarily on the activities of left- and right-wing extremists and counter-espionage . although schily is thought to be keen to also bring the bfv to the capital , the head of the agency , heinz fromm , for the moment appears set against a move .
and schily may have enough on his plate contending with unhappy bka officials , who have begun to complain about the relocation plans . klaus jansen , head of a german law enforcement association , told the associated press that there was no professional reason to move the bka to berlin and that relocating the agency could actually have a negative effect on morale . “ what we need is a highly-motivated police force especially in light of the current challenges , ” jansen said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism alarm in hamburg german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

8 , eu chief foreign policy officer , javier solana , pushed ireland - traditionally a neutral country in security matters - to implement the european union ’ s security strategy .
eu leaders agreed to the document , which outlines the major threats to european security , during last month 's summit in brussels .
with its focus on terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , regional conflicts and organized crime , the strategy has been described by solana as " a new strategic approach " for the eu ’ s foreign policy .
" it will fall to ireland to put the strategy into practice , " solana said .
but with polls showing ireland as having the lowest level of support for common defense policy , the matter is a delicate one for the irish presidency .
in an effort to counter accusations that the common security strategy represents a militarization of the eu , solana said " the eu is not a military bloc – it has not been and it will not be . " solana also denied that the eu was trying to compete with the u.s. in terms of power and military strength .
instead he emphasized the need to " develop a strategic culture that fosters early , rapid and when necessary , robust intervention . "

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

8 , eu chief foreign policy officer , javier solana , pushed ireland - traditionally a neutral country in security matters - to implement the european union ’ s security strategy .
eu leaders agreed to the document , which outlines the major threats to european security , during last month 's summit in brussels .

" it will fall to ireland to put the strategy into practice , " solana said .
but with polls showing ireland as having the lowest level of support for common defense policy , the matter is a delicate one for the irish presidency .
in an effort to counter accusations that the common security strategy represents a militarization of the eu , solana said " the eu is not a military bloc – it has not been and it will not be . " solana also denied that the eu was trying to compete with the u.s. in terms of power and military strength .

8 , eu chief foreign policy officer , javier solana , pushed ireland - traditionally a neutral country in security matters - to implement the european union ’ s security strategy .
eu leaders agreed to the document , which outlines the major threats to european security , during last month 's summit in brussels .
with its focus on terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , regional conflicts and organized crime , the strategy has been described by solana as " a new strategic approach " for the eu ’ s foreign policy .
" it will fall to ireland to put the strategy into practice , " solana said .
but with polls showing ireland as having the lowest level of support for common defense policy , the matter is a delicate one for the irish presidency .
in an effort to counter accusations that the common security strategy represents a militarization of the eu , solana said " the eu is not a military bloc – it has not been and it will not be . " solana also denied that the eu was trying to compete with the u.s. in terms of power and military strength .
instead he emphasized the need to " develop a strategic culture that fosters early , rapid and when necessary , robust intervention . "

ecb president jean-claude trichet did not directly address the issue of the soaring euro , which has climbed steadily against the u.s. dollar in recent months , but said that “ export growth should continue to benefit from the dynamic expansion of the world economy . ”
only in the last month , the euro has gained about 5 percent against the dollar to its present high of $ 1.27 .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .

farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .

the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .

currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .

he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .

farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

and schily may have enough on his plate contending with unhappy bka officials , who have begun to complain about the relocation plans . klaus jansen , head of a german law enforcement association , told the associated press that there was no professional reason to move the bka to berlin and that relocating the agency could actually have a negative effect on morale . “ what we need is a highly-motivated police force especially in light of the current challenges , ” jansen said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism alarm in hamburg german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .

" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.01.2004 germany grapples with bse scare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : careful does it .
as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .
“ that said , it ’ s good news to see mister chirac is finally making jobs the priority for 2004 . ” dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leads mediation talks on reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.01.2004 germany grapples with bse scare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : careful does it .
as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .
the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital . german interior minister otto schily will soon have a better eye on those supposed to keep tabs on everybody else . with the aim of concentrating germany ’ s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies near the government , schily on wednesday announced the bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , the country ’ s federal police force , would move from two western locations to berlin by 2008 . “ the concentration of a number of operational units to one location and the grouping of police competence makes sense organizationally and is justified due to the increased challenges from the fight against international terrorism , ” schily said . only last autumn , germany ’ s main foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , announced it would move to berlin from the sleepy town of pullach outside of munich to be closer to important decision-making in the capital .
although germany has a long tradition of placing federal agencies throughout the country , many officials like schily feel a more centralized security apparatus would be better suited to the tackling the threats of a post-sept .
11 world . bka will still have two centers the bka presently is based in wiesbaden near frankfurt , with a small branch in meckenheim near germany ’ s former capital bonn .
now , by pushing for the unexpected relocation of the agency , schily has made clear he wants to improve the government ’ s crisis management ability by having key law enforcement authorities within his reach as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kersten , president of the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .
the bka ’ s berlin office , currently with a staff of 500 , will this year increase by 300 .
bka director ulrich kersten -lrb- photo -rrb- and the entire directorate will complete their move by 2006 .
but around half of the agency ’ s total 5,000 employees will stay in wiesbaden , which will remain an important center for information technology , research , administration and education . domestic intelligence still in cologne the decision to bring the bka also to berlin leaves only one other important security agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- in cologne in western germany , far away from the federal government .
whereas the bnd is involved in foreign intelligence gathering , the bfv is germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency , focusing primarily on the activities of left- and right-wing extremists and counter-espionage . although schily is thought to be keen to also bring the bfv to the capital , the head of the agency , heinz fromm , for the moment appears set against a move .
and schily may have enough on his plate contending with unhappy bka officials , who have begun to complain about the relocation plans . klaus jansen , head of a german law enforcement association , told the associated press that there was no professional reason to move the bka to berlin and that relocating the agency could actually have a negative effect on morale . “ what we need is a highly-motivated police force especially in light of the current challenges , ” jansen said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism alarm in hamburg german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .
the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital . german interior minister otto schily will soon have a better eye on those supposed to keep tabs on everybody else . with the aim of concentrating germany ’ s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies near the government , schily on wednesday announced the bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , the country ’ s federal police force , would move from two western locations to berlin by 2008 . “ the concentration of a number of operational units to one location and the grouping of police competence makes sense organizationally and is justified due to the increased challenges from the fight against international terrorism , ” schily said . only last autumn , germany ’ s main foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , announced it would move to berlin from the sleepy town of pullach outside of munich to be closer to important decision-making in the capital .
although germany has a long tradition of placing federal agencies throughout the country , many officials like schily feel a more centralized security apparatus would be better suited to the tackling the threats of a post-sept .

and schily may have enough on his plate contending with unhappy bka officials , who have begun to complain about the relocation plans . klaus jansen , head of a german law enforcement association , told the associated press that there was no professional reason to move the bka to berlin and that relocating the agency could actually have a negative effect on morale . “ what we need is a highly-motivated police force especially in light of the current challenges , ” jansen said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism alarm in hamburg german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .

to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .
the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital . german interior minister otto schily will soon have a better eye on those supposed to keep tabs on everybody else . with the aim of concentrating germany ’ s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies near the government , schily on wednesday announced the bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , the country ’ s federal police force , would move from two western locations to berlin by 2008 . “ the concentration of a number of operational units to one location and the grouping of police competence makes sense organizationally and is justified due to the increased challenges from the fight against international terrorism , ” schily said . only last autumn , germany ’ s main foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , announced it would move to berlin from the sleepy town of pullach outside of munich to be closer to important decision-making in the capital .
although germany has a long tradition of placing federal agencies throughout the country , many officials like schily feel a more centralized security apparatus would be better suited to the tackling the threats of a post-sept .
11 world . bka will still have two centers the bka presently is based in wiesbaden near frankfurt , with a small branch in meckenheim near germany ’ s former capital bonn .
now , by pushing for the unexpected relocation of the agency , schily has made clear he wants to improve the government ’ s crisis management ability by having key law enforcement authorities within his reach as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kersten , president of the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .
the bka ’ s berlin office , currently with a staff of 500 , will this year increase by 300 .
bka director ulrich kersten -lrb- photo -rrb- and the entire directorate will complete their move by 2006 .
but around half of the agency ’ s total 5,000 employees will stay in wiesbaden , which will remain an important center for information technology , research , administration and education . domestic intelligence still in cologne the decision to bring the bka also to berlin leaves only one other important security agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- in cologne in western germany , far away from the federal government .
whereas the bnd is involved in foreign intelligence gathering , the bfv is germany ’ s domestic intelligence agency , focusing primarily on the activities of left- and right-wing extremists and counter-espionage . although schily is thought to be keen to also bring the bfv to the capital , the head of the agency , heinz fromm , for the moment appears set against a move .
and schily may have enough on his plate contending with unhappy bka officials , who have begun to complain about the relocation plans . klaus jansen , head of a german law enforcement association , told the associated press that there was no professional reason to move the bka to berlin and that relocating the agency could actually have a negative effect on morale . “ what we need is a highly-motivated police force especially in light of the current challenges , ” jansen said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism alarm in hamburg german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .

the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .

a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .
“ that said , it ’ s good news to see mister chirac is finally making jobs the priority for 2004 . ” dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leads mediation talks on reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 france slashes unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like in germany , the chronically unemployed are the target in france .
french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2004 eu split over sky marshals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the real thing : a u.s. sky marshal in a mock hijacking attempt .
a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .
" we have to banish danger on the ground , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2004 airbus overtakes boeing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus parent eads is also gaining ground .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .
germany has 287 officially confirmed cases of bse to date , 49 of which were discovered in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe cautiously eyes u.s. mad cow case following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude .

meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .
“ that said , it ’ s good news to see mister chirac is finally making jobs the priority for 2004 . ” dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leads mediation talks on reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .
the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital . german interior minister otto schily will soon have a better eye on those supposed to keep tabs on everybody else . with the aim of concentrating germany ’ s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies near the government , schily on wednesday announced the bundeskriminalamt -lrb- bka -rrb- , the country ’ s federal police force , would move from two western locations to berlin by 2008 . “ the concentration of a number of operational units to one location and the grouping of police competence makes sense organizationally and is justified due to the increased challenges from the fight against international terrorism , ” schily said . only last autumn , germany ’ s main foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , announced it would move to berlin from the sleepy town of pullach outside of munich to be closer to important decision-making in the capital .
although germany has a long tradition of placing federal agencies throughout the country , many officials like schily feel a more centralized security apparatus would be better suited to the tackling the threats of a post-sept .
11 world . bka will still have two centers the bka presently is based in wiesbaden near frankfurt , with a small branch in meckenheim near germany ’ s former capital bonn .
now , by pushing for the unexpected relocation of the agency , schily has made clear he wants to improve the government ’ s crisis management ability by having key law enforcement authorities within his reach as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kersten , president of the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .
the bka ’ s berlin office , currently with a staff of 500 , will this year increase by 300 .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing . several german states admitted this week that authorities had failed to conduct bse tests on cattle before they were slaughtered and said unchecked beef could have well landed on the market by now .
officials estimate that the total number of untested cattle germany-wide runs into the hundreds .
" criminal energy " the revelation has sparked outrage and disbelief in berlin .
deputy minister for consumer protection , alexander müller , said " criminal energy " was at play and said cattle were apparently slaughtered off the books in several cases without any concern for meat hygiene .
" obviously there was an attempt to save money , by avoiding conducting tests on cattle over 24 months , " müller said in a radio interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bse tests in germany , all cattle over 24 months have to be tested for the deadly brain wasting disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , as opposed to the 30 months stipulated by the eu .
the more stringent regulation was imposed by germany in the wake of the first case of mad cow detected three years ago .
scientists believe cattle under 30 months old are least likely to carry mad cow disease .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of the disease , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from infected patients .
discrepancies in central bse database müller however downplayed fears that germany was dealing with another bse outbreak .
he said that from a statistical point of view , the possibility that animals infected with the disease were among the untested cattle is " very slim . "
at the same time the minister stressed that the important thing was implementing the basic law governing bse , namely , " every animal has to be thoroughly investigated . "
authorities stumbled upon the current failures in the testing system by detecting discrepancies between the number of slaughtered and tested cattle in a central database , where all states are supposed to feed in bse test data since 2003 .
the german agricultural ministry said at least 0.6 percent or 17,000 of three million beef cattle that were meant to be tested in 2003 were affected .
however , authorities have pointed out that the inconsistencies in the data don ’ t necessarily mean that bse testing wasn ’ t carried out in thousands of cattle .
in some cases , administrative errors such as data entered too late or wrong addresses of farmers was responsible for the miscalculation .
possible consumer backlash though the fallout from the disaster remains unclear , experts aren ’ t ruling out a dip in consumer confidence that had been painfully restored after the bse crisis of 2000 .
matthias wolfschmidt from consumer group foodwatch told dw-world that it was too early to speculate on how high the risk for consumers could be .
" we don ’ t have any information on animals that have tested positive for bse , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canadian beef rib-eye steaks at the same time wolfschmidt pointed out that there is an emotional and psychological dimension to the issue .
" there was a huge fall in beef eaters when the first bse case came to light in nov .
2000 .
and though it has picked up again , it ’ s not the same as it used to be before the arrival of bse , he said .
" consumers do tend to get jittery . "
statistics show that beef consumption in germany has normalized to 8.4 kilograms per person in 2003 as opposed to 6.8 kilograms in 2001 .
that rate is still behind the 9.5 to 10.5 kg average per person prior to the bse crisis .

french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .
meanwhile , cutbacks that began in january are already drawing criticism . french president jacques chirac is vowing to make 2004 the year of employment .
and new rules on unemployment that cut benefits dramatically and attempt to get the chronically unemployed back to work are part of the plan .
for starters , unemployment benefits will be limited to 22 months instead of 30 .
this change will effect nearly 200,000 people . evelyne zylbermann is one of thos hit by the reforms .
until now , she received € 1,400 -lrb- $ 1,780 -rrb- of unemployment benefits per month .
starting this month that will be cut to € 400 per month in emergency benefits .
“ i don ’ t know what i should do , ” zylbermann told deutsche welle .
“ i have rent and insurance to pay and a child to feed .
what am i supposed to do , i don ’ t know . ”
reforms are result of negotiations in 2002 like germany , france is in the midst of a reform course aimed at strengthening the economy .
with unemployment pushing 10 percent , this is one area of focus .
the changes going into effect are the result of negotiations between business and union leaders in 2002 .
“ the challenge in 2004 is to make the most of the return of growth with one priority : employment , ” chirac said in a new year ’ s address .
indeed , french voters rank unemployment as their top concern .
the changes to unemployment rules being implemented in france this year do not go as far as the reforms passed recently in germany , which will cut unemployment benefits to 12 months starting next year .
but they have nonetheless sparked criticism and protest from the media and union leaders .
“ it will be those with the fewest means who will pay the price of unjust policies , ” said le monde .
will reforms encourage growth ?
francois dessenty , head of cgt , the largest union in france , questioned whether the unemployment reforms will encourage growth .
“ these measures don ’ t make sense , ” dessenty told deutsche welle .
“ it isn ’ t only the unions who know that unemployment lasts longer when there is less financial support for the unemployed .
that means that the cuts won ’ t only push the jobless into poverty , they will also make it more difficult for them to eventually find a new job . ”
francois chereque , head of the cfdt union , characterized chirac ’ s plans as political posturing .
“ one gets the impression the government is in a hurry now that regional and european elections are coming , ” chereque said in an interview with le monde .
there are french regional elections in march and european parliament elections in june .
“ that said , it ’ s good news to see mister chirac is finally making jobs the priority for 2004 . ” dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder leads mediation talks on reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday took part in a parliamentary mediation committee meeting in an attempt to keep his economic and welfare reforms on track with a bold new proposal on financing tax cuts .

the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing the longtime american leader .
good products and management are behind the success , an industry analyst said . the aircraft industry was hit hard by the terrorist attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .
" we have to banish danger on the ground , " he said .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .

a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .
" it ’ s difficult there -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- to talk about weaknesses in our own work .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .

this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .
11 , 2001 .
although washington has not yet specified with what frequency and on what routes it expects airlines to have sky marshals on board , some european airlines say compliance will mean economic disadvantages . georg fongern of the international pilots ' association ifalpa described the u.s. directive as " unaffordable . " he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

" he said the measures will hinder the competitveness of european airlines , which unlike american airlines , wo n't be able to count on government support for the implementation of the measures and the cost of the seats taken up by air marshals . air marshals not new in europe some european airlines , however , are taking the new u.s. directive in stride . the german carrier lufthansa , for example , has been deploying air marshals on some flights since october 2001 .
shortly after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , germany 's federal border guard assembled a troop of around 100 marshals to accompany randomly selected lufthansa flights to north american destinations . so far the marshals have never had cause to intervene . switzerland , although not a member of the eu , has been using air marshals for over 30 years , with specially trained undercover police and army recruits boarding random international flights . france , which up until the 2003 pre-christmas period had never had armed guards on flights , has said it would put air marshals on flights to the u.s. if information from american or domestic intelligence showed it was necessary . british pilots unhappy the u.s. demands have created controversy in its traditional ally britain , where government officials defended the additional security measures despite opposition from british pilots , who fear the presence of armed air marshals could create more danger on transatlantic flights . " the thought that you have got people behind you in a pressurized cabin with guns and bullets is not a happy thought , " said a spokesman for the british pilot 's association , balpa .
" but if the government persists , we want certain conditions laid down . " the british pilots ' union is now working on gaining concessions , such as the right for pilots to be informed when air marshals are on board , and an agreement that the flight captain should retain overall command . the union also wants assurances that pilots and crew be given the choice not to fly on planes that will be manned with air marshals . british airways has said it will accept the presence of air marshals , but charter company thomas cook airlines , which is partly owned by lufthansa , announced that it would rather ground its flights to the u.s. than have armed marshals on board . german pilots ' good experience german pilots with experience of flying with air marshals on board have said they 've overcome their initial mistrust of the situation .
" i 've so far only had positive experiences , " said capt. markus kirscheck from the pilots ' association cockpit , adding that good training is essential for good cooperation .
he said german pilots work together with the trainers of air marshals in a simulator , so that both sides understand each other 's jobs . still , ifalpa views the u.s. directive as an attack on the sovereignty of other states , and says there are other , less expensive ways to prevent an airplane from turning into a terrorist weapon . the security improvements to cockpit doors , and increased security measures in airports for example , mean air marshals can offer limited additional security , according to ifalpa 's georg fongern .

a u.s. government demand that foreign airlines put armed marshals on selected flights to and from the u.s. is putting european airlines opposed to the practice under pressure and creating yet another transatlantic row . ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it plans to hold a summit of eu aviation officials to resolve the crisis between europe and the u.s. over the deployment of armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights . several eu member states - including sweden , denmark , and portugal - have said they oppose the new regulations , which are part of the u.s. government 's tighter security precautions aimed to prevent a terrorist attack similar to that on sept .

but airbus is showing that there are still ways to get ahead .
the european manufacturer delivered more than 300 planes in 2003 , surpassing boeing , the long-time leader , which made just 281 planes .
there are many reasons for the airbus success .
“ they have worked well , have good products and a good client structure , ” said nils machemehl , an industry analyst at m.m. warburg , adding that the main reason boeing lost its top position is that its products are too old . airbus and boeing remain competitive in the so-called narrow body airplanes -lrb- those with just one aisle -rrb- that are used almost exclusively for short-haul flights , according to machemehl .
but airbus leads with the long-haul machines such as the a 330 and a 340 , which are more modern than boeing ’ s models . only the 777 is competitive “ with the 777 , boeing has just one modern product in this segment , ” machemehl said .
“ the 767 and 747 are outdated models . ” even the defence industry , which has long been dominated by u.s. firms , may soon be dominated by europe .
the airbus parent company eads , the european aeronautic defence company , is competitive in three out of four defence industry segments . machemehl said eads is competitive in fighter planes , rockets and satellites .
the best-known eads project is the eurofighter plane .
eads is also building a military satellite system for britain . eads lags when it comes to military transport planes only when it comes to military transport planes does eads lag behind the american competition . the market for aircraft is not expected to change significantly in 2004 for either airbus or boeing .
the industry is still experiencing a downturn and needs time for consolidation , the german head of airbus said in a recent interview . hopes for growth lie mainly with the discount airlines .
growth in this market could help compensate for the decline of the traditional airlines , machemehl said . michael knigge -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby airbus spreads its wings , finally the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .
with its 70,000 hectares , it is nearly three times the size of its german counterpart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynx , bavarian forest with the entry of the czech republic into the european union on may 1 , 2004 , wanninger hopes that the first steps can be taken to expand the bavarian forest biosphere - not only in the direction of the communities surrounding it , but also across the border into the czech republic .
" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .
" with its entry into the eu , we hope the cooperation will be easier and i am sure we will begin work on an expanded cross-border biosphere . "
such an area would include nearly 100,000 hectares of forest .
the bavarian forest will need another generation before it recovers from the damage incurred by the bark beetles .
they have destroyed close to 4,000 hectares , or nearly one-sixth of the national park .
however , the beetle attacks have been receding in the past two years and destruction , while it still goes on , has slowed down . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalpark bayerischer wald the bavarian forest national park ’ s official website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .
" people always say that tourism destroys what it discovers , " says henne .
" but that means we have to channel it in a way that is responsible .
that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "
a tricky balancing act those involved in tourism know that attracting visitors without compromising the reserve ’ s environmental regulations can be a tricky balancing act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin the people who enforce these regulations and explain them to the public are the biosphere rangers .
klaus christian arndt is one of the rangers , who is in close contact with the local community .
he says visitors are often more understanding of the biosphere ’ s measures to protect the environment than many locals .
many people who live in the biosphere , for example , are annoyed by the old cobblestone roads , he says .
in other parts of eastern germany , they ’ ve long been paved over .
but they serve a useful environmental purpose , because they slow down traffic and allow rain water to trickle through into the ground .
" very few people know about the special status of the region they live in , " says arndt .
many take the area for granted , and think they don ’ t need the reserve .
" they think they ’ ve always done fine without it , and that ’ s why it ’ s difficult to explain that we are trying to find new ways for people to live and work in a sustainable manner , and to find ways how more people can find work here again .

within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .
say , for example , when it comes to transporting their products to berlin .
we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .
berliners already know a certain amount about our produce , but we have to create more awareness about what sustainable agriculture really means and that ’ s a slow process . "

visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .

that ’ s why we ’ re building things like a fish otter enclosure right next to the visitor ’ s center .
people can see the animals close up in their natural habitat without causing harm .
there will be areas where we can allow only a very small numbers of visitors , but there will be places where many people can go . "

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .

the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world . when the glaciers in the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve melt in the summer , the water in the streams turns white .
glacier milk is what the locals call it .
the mountains rise straight into the sky , birds sing , and a lone eagle circles on a thermal wave before flying back to its nest .
the sounds of cowbells from a distant pasture add their reassuring peal .
the berchtesgaden alpine and national park in bavaria was founded 25 years ago .
unesco declared it part of the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve in 1990 .
its core comprises alpine meadows , mountains and lakes .
altogether , the biosphere forms an area of nearly 500 square kilometers .
it doesn ’ t only include this wilderness , though , but also towns , farms and recreation areas .
zukunft biosphäre administers projects in the reserve .
it is precisely these human areas in the biosphere ’ s outermost zone , which concern director werner d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
in this so-called " transitional " zone , the most important goal of the biosphere is that the human population gets into contact with the concept of sustainable development , he says .
" the very fundamental idea is that we use our surrounding , our biosphere in a way that our children can use it also . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden the sustainable use of the biosphere calls for conservation measures .
currently , d ’ oleire-oltmanns and his team are working on automobile-free tourism projects .
one calls for bicycle trails in the transitional zone , another involves an online booking system , in which tourists can organize car-free holidays in the biosphere .
he says tourism is falling in berchtesgaden and the local officials welcome anything , which will attract new ecologically-sound tourism to the area .
" we need a certain mix , " he says .
" hiking is important .
wellness is also important and a combination is also a possibility , but it ’ s best if you have a mix . "
convincing the farming community but attracting tourists is not the only goal .
the reserve authorities also want to convince the people living within the biosphere .
for the region ’ s farmers , many of whom can barely make a living by farming alone , the biosphere idea was viewed with skepticism .
" farmers are very conservative , " says d ’ oleire-oltmanns .
" we have two groups : those who see the possibility of an advantage and those who sternly oppose any change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden because of its topography , it is almost impossible to separate wilderness sectors from agricultural use areas in berchtesgaden .
the mountainous terrain leaves farmers with very little flat land , not enough to support grazing animals .
over the centuries , they have cleared forest and still maintain the practice of taking their animals to summer pastures in the mountains .
as a result , there are cows in the national park and farmers maintain their century-old grazing rights , even in the high meadows .
" i don ’ t think we really needed this . "
franz kuchlbauer farms the kederbacherhof , a farm that was first recorded in a land deed in 1380 .
he has 13 hectares of land .
most of it is so steep , he has to mow the hay by hand .
without his alpine meadows , he would be unable to continue farming .
he takes his 20 cows into the mountains , where they remain each year from the beginning of june to the end of september , grazing in two of his pastures .
kuchelbauer ’ s attitude to the biosphere reserve is wait and see .
" so far , nothing has changed , but that usually happens later , " he says .
" as farmers , i don ’ t think we really needed this .
farmers have formed our landscape since the 13th century and , as you can see , it is still beautiful .
and neither a national park nor a biosphere could have done it better .
all we can do is maintain it and for that , you also need farmers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berchtesgaden if the farmers give up , he adds , there would only be a wilderness in the valley .
" and that ’ s not anything anybody wants . "
farmers get no financial help from the biosphere project .
kuchlbauer can only survive thanks to his second job as an electrician .
many small farmers like him depend on second jobs .
for their children , the idea of working eight hours in town , then going home to put in another 8 hours on the farm is not very attractive .
prices of produce and meat are so low ; it is hardly worth it to raise them on the labor-intensive alpine farms .
farmers have to sell their produce locally .
expensive transport to metropolitan markets , where they have to compete with agro businesses just doesn ’ t pay .
the biosphere can only offer farmers encouragement , but no funds to help them .
funding problem perhaps that is the crux of the biosphere problem .
it has the responsibility to preserve and sustain an area , but no real political power and no source of funding .
the idea is that the label " biosphere reserve " is in itself attractive enough to galvanize local governments to pitch in .
but for that , major marketing measures are needed , says d ’ oleire-oltmanns , and there is no funding for such measures .
" one problem of biospheres is that they ’ re not very well known , and not important politically , " he says .
" the second problem is that all biosphere reserves have a weak administration , so they are working hard , but developing concepts needs public support , " he adds .
without marketing possibilities , however , this goal remains as out of reach as the surrounding mountaintops . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berchtesgaden national park further information on the park 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .
it estimated that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the u.s. and added that three of the four germans who have won a nobel prize are currently working in the u.s. germany once an education mecca the country ’ s current academic misery is a far cry from the golden age of education reformer wilhelm von humboldt -lrb- 1767-1835 -rrb- when germany ’ s oldest universities such as heidelberg , tübingen , leipzig and freiburg enjoyed a reputation beyond the country 's borders . in 1810 humboldt founded the university in berlin that now bears his name .
humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .
" it ’ s like with the eu , " simon white of the max planck institute for astrophysics told the paper .
" researchers in europe have learned to work together even when there are differences of opinion . "
white said greater competition in the u.s. often hindered cooperation .

the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment . the unesco biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin north of berlin was set up just days before german reunification in 1990 by the east german authorities .
it was a last minute attempt to give this region something special , something to make it stand out and put it on the map .
and that it is , says eberhard henne , head of the reserve .
for him , the uckermark , with its rolling hills and unspoiled landscape , is a natural gem still waiting to be discovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin " for me , it ’ s one of the nicest landscapes in europe .
it really is ! " he says .
" there are lots of wonderful lakes , moors and forests .
landscapes that have long disappeared in other parts of germany have been preserved here because of the region ’ s small population . "
" there are tiny villages , much smaller than you would find elsewhere in germany , " he adds .
" and there are lots of rare animal and plant species , too .
for anyone who ’ s open to nature , this is a true dorado . "
a paradise indeed : this is one of the few areas in germany were you can walk for hours without encountering another person .
visitors are more likely to see eagles , cranes , red deer or beavers , to name but a few of the animals that live in the protected environment of the biosphere .
recognizing potential for the local communities though , this natural paradise is a difficult place to make a living .
since the collapse of communist east germany , state-subsidized farms and industries have disappeared - and with them , thousands of jobs .
in the years following reunification in 1990 , when hardly any west german companies chose to settle here , many locals blamed the biosphere ’ s strict environmental guidelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin but manfred birthler , the farming and environment minister of the state of brandenburg , disagrees .
" i personally see a very different picture , " he says .
" i see lots of initiative from the nature reserves to promote the region , and help create jobs .
within the area of the biosphere reserve , there is far less unemployment than outside it , because we have created jobs here . "
slowly , people are beginning to see the potential in that special status .
the biosphere reserve has discovered that it has huge marketing value for the region .
it has created a regional brand , which stands for high-quality farming produce and eco-friendly nature tourism .
" over 60 businesses have so far been awarded the regional brand of the biosphere reserve , " says birthler .
" this is creating and securing jobs in the countryside . "
working together so far , only about three percent of german consumers regularly buy organic products .
but henne - who ’ s seen the reserve ’ s own organic shop in berlin fail - admits that it ’ s a difficult market , which is growing more slowly than many expected .
he believes farmers in the biosphere only have a chance if they work together , not just using the same seal , but also sharing the same logistics .
" i know there isn ’ t much buying power here in the region with over 20 percent unemployment , but that ’ s why we have to do something now to counteract that , " he says .
" the people who live here and who produce or process food here have to work together .

we can ’ t have everyone driving there separately .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schorfheide-chorin , kaiserbahnhof to speed things up , the reserve is counting on tourism .
visitors to the region are introduced to local products and learn about the importance of sustainability , in agriculture and in tourism .

the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating . the forest presents an eerie picture .
from afar , huge sections stretching to the horizon appear lilac-gray .
when you enter the forest , giant trees lie on the ground , along with broken branches .
those still standing are broken in half - rotting wood as far as the eye can see .
but the forest is not dead .
beneath the trunks of fallen trees , young spruce have already started building a new forest .
beech , mountain ash and other deciduous trees are also growing in the areas cleared by the spruce bark beetle .
hans kiener , head of the department for nature conservation at the bavarian forest national park , says the new mountain mixed forest will be far superior to the old spruce wood stands that it replaces .
" when you looked at this area 20 years ago , you saw a beautiful spruce forest , green and alive .
but this spruce forest was not natural , " kiener explains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest " it was manmade , tended for hundreds of years by the foresters .
what we can see now is a new generation of trees that is of different ages and mixed , like a mosaic .
we can expect the new generation will be more resistant to the bark beetles , which affected the old stand of trees before . "
the bavarian forest national park is the largest forest area in central europe where nothing has been done to interfere with nature .
the forest has simply been left to its own devices .
dead wood is not removed and nothing is done against pests , like the bark beetle .
no intervention in 1981 , the bavarian forest national park was named a unesco biosphere .
joseph wanninger is in charge of the biosphere project .
he says the inhabitants , for whom the forest represents an important asset in terms of natural resources in the past and as a tourist attraction in the present , were appalled that officials did nothing to stop the insect ’ s damage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian forest in winter " in the beginning , there were many problems , " says wanninger .
" the people here wanted us to change the national park concept to allow us to stop the bark beetle , so to come into the forest with power saws and fight the beetle .
then , it became clear to them that such action would result in huge bare areas . "
due to the park ’ s importance for the tourist industry , this would be bad for the region .
" now , although they are still very critical , they accept that we do not intervene , " he says .
the spruce bark beetle is less than 6 millimeters long .
it only attacks spruce trees , burrowing through the bark and feeding on the layer of tissue right beneath it , the cambium .
these tissues carry nutrients from the foliage to the roots , and water from the roots to the foliage .
the bark beetle digs tunnels in the cambium , where it lays its eggs .
eventually it girdles the tree , cutting off the nutrients .
just 50 beetles are enough to kill a fully-grown tree in just eight weeks .
the larvae laid in the tunnels hatch to produce tens of thousands of new beetles to attack neighboring trees .
the only effective way to stop destruction is to fell the tree and remove it from the park .
the park officials only follow this procedure in the buffer zone between wilderness areas and commercial forests , in order to prevent the bark beetle from spreading outside the confines of the park .
expansion to the east across the border from the bavarian forest is the sumova national park in the czech republic .

" the goal is one biosphere that crosses the border and includes both parks , " says wanninger .
he says after may 1 , it will be much easier to deal with cross-border issues with the czech republic .

chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore . even as berlin students continue with a long-running strike to protest against drastic cuts and looming tuition fees , germany ’ s ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have announced they will place education and research high on their agenda this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder chancellor schröder ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- party announced on tuesday it would raise spending for innovation and research to three percent of gdp from the current 2.5 percent by 2010 .
in addition , the spd wants to set up at least ten elite universities in germany modeled along the lines of harvard and stanford in the u.s. education minster edelgard buhlmann has defended the elite university concept , saying that none of germany ’ s universities enjoy a reputation for greater overall excellence and the move would ensure the country kept abreast with international developments and educational requirements .
the spd is also at pains to emphasize that no new elite universities would be founded , but would rather be formed from the competition between existing educational institutions .
" we must search for ways for german universities to keep pace with internationally renowned ones abroad , " spd general secretary olaf scholz said .
critics slam elite university proposal both the media and critics within the spd have seized on the elite university concept .
most point out that many german universities are already in shambles owing to a dire lack of funds , overcrowding in lecture halls and poorly equipped libraries and laboratories and that an elite university would only exacerbate the problems .
others point out there ’ s no tradition in germany of foundations and endowments such as those that fund american elite universities .
the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- has calculated that at least a € 100 million would be needed every year to bring a part of german universities up to top-notch international standards , an impossible feat considering germany ’ s poorly-performing economy .
government blamed for brain-drain the respected conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also criticized the education ministry for driving away young scientists and graduates through a lack of incentive , a sentiment echoed by many of the country ’ s leading newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a laboratory peers into a microscope .
a recent report in the scientist magazine quoted a number of germany ’ s business leaders saying they feared the continuing exodus of young scientists is now threatening the future of the country ’ s biotechnology industry .

humboldt ’ s reforms of higher education were largely responsible for the fact that german universities attained a leadership in science and the humanities up to world war ii .
large-scale reforms in the 1960s and 1970s have , however , brought about several changes in the german university landscape .
in an attempt to modernize , the country has seen a cropping up of business and technical universities that aim to offer quick-fix international degrees such as the b.a. and mba and attract a corresponding rush of foreign students .
but in the face of overall dwindling funds , germany ’ s new internationalism has failed to catch on .
a high-profile example is that of the berlin-based european school of management and technology , backed by big business , which is still waiting to open its doors , after a missed deadline last september .
brain drain being reversed ?
but despite pessimistic reports of germany ’ s falling education standards and the appalling lack of funds for education and research in the country , things may actually not be as bad as they are made out to be .
a recent report in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung suggested the so-called brain drain may be exaggerated .
a number of top german researchers , who had returned to germany from the u.s. in recent years , cited better security in germany , astronomical rents in the u.s , the growing strength of the euro , a better quality of life for their kids in germany and washington ’ s increasing exclusionist policies towards researchers from so-called " rogue " countries as reasons for coming back .

the estate , run by the late musician 's family , says dr gilbert lederman of staten island university hospital coerced harrison to sign souvenirs .
the action also alleges dr lederman used harrison 's treatment to gain publicity for himself and his hospital .
dr lederman , through his solicitor , has strongly denied the allegations .
harrison died of cancer in november 2001 in los angeles .
one of the main allegations of the legal action , filed in brooklyn federal court , was that dr lederman got an extremely sick harrison to sign his son 's guitar and autographs for his two daughters .
in the latest legal move , mr lederman has offered to donate the guitar , which has been valued at less than $ 10,000 to a charity agreed upon by both sides .
but harrison 's family dismissed the offer as " spin " and said they would not drop the lawsuit .
as far as mr harrison being forced to sign the guitar goes , he absolutely and categorically denies that dr lederman 's lawyer court papers claim dr lederman " preyed upon mr harrison while he was in a greatly deteriorated mental and physical condition by coercing " him to sign the items .
they suggest dr lederman took his children to see harrison , making the musician listen to his son playing the guitar .
they go on to say that when harrison resisted signing autographs , dr lederman held his hand to help him write .
return " as far as mr harrison being forced to sign the guitar goes , he absolutely and categorically denies that , " said the doctor 's lawyer , wayne roth .
it is also alleged that the doctor sold his story to the national enquirer after harrison 's death , along with pictures of his son holding the guitar .
" staten island university hospital takes patient confidentiality very seriously and has not breached confidentiality , " said hospital spokeswoman arleen ryback .

english partnerships and milton keynes council have put forward plans for a so-called partnerships committee - to co-ordinate plans for 70,000 new homes in the town over the next 20 years .
environmental campaigners are concerned about the power the committee will have and its lack of democratic accountability .
but an english partnerships ' spokeswoman said the fears were not justified and that environmental issues were at the top of its agenda .
the committee , which aims to start work at the end of april 2004 , is in charge of plans which could see milton keynes become bigger than nottingham and nearly as large as liverpool . "
it seems that the normal planning process is collapsing in this top-down initiative " alice crampin , chairwoman of cpre bedfordshire the town 's population is likely to rise from 210,000 to nearly 400,000 .
the proposals could also see major expansion in upton , northampton .
on wednesday , henry oliver , head of planning for the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- , spoke of his concerns about the area around milton keynes designated for expansion and about the committee itself .
areas earmarked for development include greenfield land to the west of the town near the village of calverton and land to the east near wavendon and woburn sands .
mr oliver said he was concerned that some of the land singled out by the committee had not been earmarked for development in the region 's local plan .
" the amount of greenfield land is worrying , " he said .
he said the committee , which is made up of appointees by the government and councils , should not pre-empt local democratic planning decisions .
mr oliver said the wide-ranging powers of the committee were also a cause for concern .
the committee could undertake compulsory purchase -lrb- as can local authorities -rrb- , buy sites , invest in roads and undertake promotional activities .
" there is a danger this committee could be bulldozing through the countryside and public opinion , " he said .
andrew lockley , planning spokesman for friends of the earth in milton keynes , said he feared the committee would not contain a " sufficient range of experts on the environment " .
he also thought the committee would push through the development of greenfield land on the outskirts of the town instead of brownfield or urban land in the centre of milton keynes .
" these greenfield sites could account for most of the growth needed .
these are not the right places to develop , " he told bbc news online . "
it is very much the ethos of english partnerships to work in partnership and environmental issues are on the top of our agenda and thought " english partnerships ' spokeswoman alice crampin , chairwoman of cpre bedfordshire , criticised the committee 's lack of democratic accountability .
" it seems that the normal planning process is collapsing in this top-down initiative , " she said .
a spokeswoman for english partnerships said the committee would not " bulldoze " through plans and public consultation was taking place on the plans .
" it is very much the ethos of english partnerships to work in partnership and environmental issues are on the top of our agenda and thought , " she said .
she said the committee would not have power to over-rule regional local plans .
it will also include independent members , who will apply for the posts , although the final decision on appointments would be the government 's , she said .
about 1,800 hectares is expected to be needed for the main area of development for the expansion of milton keynes .
one of the last major urban expansions in the uk took place at the end of the 1940s with the development of 30 new towns .

english partnerships and milton keynes council have put forward plans for a so-called partnerships committee - to co-ordinate plans for 70,000 new homes in the town over the next 20 years .
environmental campaigners are concerned about the power the committee will have and its lack of democratic accountability .
but an english partnerships ' spokeswoman said the fears were not justified and that environmental issues were at the top of its agenda .
the committee , which aims to start work at the end of april 2004 , is in charge of plans which could see milton keynes become bigger than nottingham and nearly as large as liverpool .

on wednesday , henry oliver , head of planning for the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- , spoke of his concerns about the area around milton keynes designated for expansion and about the committee itself .
areas earmarked for development include greenfield land to the west of the town near the village of calverton and land to the east near wavendon and woburn sands .
mr oliver said he was concerned that some of the land singled out by the committee had not been earmarked for development in the region 's local plan .
" the amount of greenfield land is worrying , " he said .
he said the committee , which is made up of appointees by the government and councils , should not pre-empt local democratic planning decisions .
mr oliver said the wide-ranging powers of the committee were also a cause for concern .
the committee could undertake compulsory purchase -lrb- as can local authorities -rrb- , buy sites , invest in roads and undertake promotional activities .
" there is a danger this committee could be bulldozing through the countryside and public opinion , " he said .
andrew lockley , planning spokesman for friends of the earth in milton keynes , said he feared the committee would not contain a " sufficient range of experts on the environment " .
he also thought the committee would push through the development of greenfield land on the outskirts of the town instead of brownfield or urban land in the centre of milton keynes .

english partnerships and milton keynes council have put forward plans for a so-called partnerships committee - to co-ordinate plans for 70,000 new homes in the town over the next 20 years .
environmental campaigners are concerned about the power the committee will have and its lack of democratic accountability .
but an english partnerships ' spokeswoman said the fears were not justified and that environmental issues were at the top of its agenda .
the committee , which aims to start work at the end of april 2004 , is in charge of plans which could see milton keynes become bigger than nottingham and nearly as large as liverpool .

areas earmarked for development include greenfield land to the west of the town near the village of calverton and land to the east near wavendon and woburn sands .
mr oliver said he was concerned that some of the land singled out by the committee had not been earmarked for development in the region 's local plan .

the met office confirmed that it was the hottest year since its official records began in 1961 .
environmental group wwf scotland went further and claimed it was the hottest year for at least 140 years - and issued a warning over climate change .
head of policy dr richard dixon expressed concern at the figures .

it said greenhouse gas emissions had fallen and that the uk was on course to meet international commitments .
wwf scotland said the met office 's records had previously identified 1997 as the hottest year since 1861 .
an average temperature of 8c was recorded that year .

" temperatures were quite variable across the uk but in all the scottish regions - the north , the east and the west - 2003 was the warmest year we have recorded . "
it was the sunniest year since 1961 in the north and east of the country , and the third sunniest in the west .

a government backed report suggests local authorities should be given the power to introduce " pay-as-you-throw " schemes .
oxfordshire county council chiefs say the scheme would see most taxpayers paying less as those producing large amounts of rubbish took on a greater financial burden .
adam symons , the council 's head of waste management , said : " everyone knows that if you charge for rubbish people recycle more and throw away less but , although we are under pressure to recycle more , we can not act in this way . "
we have to consider everything that could help to reduce the amount of rubbish that is created in oxfordshire " county councillor anne purse " it might happen and then we would expect individuals to pay for their rubbish rather than the general taxpayer .
" i know some householders who are upset that they pay the same as other people even though they recycle all their rubbish . "

james harris was returning home from a family break in the us when he was separated from his wife and three children and taken off for an intense hour of questioning .
the family had spent a few days in new york to celebrate mr harris ' 50th birthday and were travelling back on new year 's day , as security checks were stepped up .
agents later told mr harris , who is a town councillor in caldicot , that he shared the same name and description as someone on their most wanted list .
as he tried to board the flight to heathrow , mr harris had already been searched twice , once in the presence of 60 security guards , before the interrogation took place .
" the first question was a bit of a mindblower , he said ' are you a member of any terrorist organisation ? ' , " he said .
i think there was somebody watching me all the way back to heathrow james harris " he wanted my family background , my wife 's background , places i have travelled to .
" at the end of the interview , he really said that there was a terrorist fitting my description with exactly the same name - i was a bit dumbfounded .
" my saving grace was that i had n't visited pakistan so i was free to go .
" after that , there was a massive armed escort and , as a family , we were split up on the aeroplane - i think there was somebody watching me all the way back to heathrow . "
mr harris said the ordeal had been " frightening " , but said he completely understood why it had happened .
" they have got to do these things for the security of their country and i appreciate that 100 % , " he said .
" i think the british people have got to accept this is a way of life now - we are going to have enhanced security checks and put time on our holidays . "
