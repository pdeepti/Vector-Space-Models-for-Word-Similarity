but the role of christianity still blocks agreement . though the ministers left brussels without any final agreement , they said they had made way on the key question of voting powers , one of the issues preventing the eu constitution from being made reality . " our continuing discussions see a consensus on that issue broadening , " irish prime minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters . the draft document foresees that a double majority of 50 percent of eu states representing at least 60 percent of the total population can decide votes in the eu council of ministers .
but countries such as spain and poland have rejected the plan as giving too much weight to larger states .
for their part , germany , france and britain are trying to stick as close as possible to the draft proposal . " everyone was willing to move to a double majority , german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
" there were different views on the figures … we wo n't accept anything nonsensical , but today 's discussion was within reasonable bands . " religion divisive none of the member states have budged on the role christianity should play in the constitution .
the czech republic , italy , lithuania , malta , poland , portugal and slovakia had just before the session sent a letter to the irish eu presidency calling for the meeting to address the hotly debated issue . " the amendment we ask for is aimed to recognize a historical truth , " the foreign ministers from mainly roman catholic countries wrote .
" we do not want to disregard either the secular nature -lrb- of the eu -rrb- … or the respect of any other religious or philosophical belief . " the current draft refers to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance . " france and belgium , where church and state are strictly kept separate , have been the most vociferous opponents to mentioning religion in the document . the irish eu presidency aims to propose compromises on the remaining issues hindering adoption of the constitution shortly before the next eu summit on june 17-18 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .

beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said .

" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go .

" we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?

the region has been racked by inter-arab violence and arab-african ethnic clashes which have left tens of thousands dead .
between 650,000 and 1.2 million people have been forced to flee their homes .
the sudanese government has been accused of aiding the janjaweed militia which is causing much of the damage and the strength of voices demanding action from the international community is increasing .
today the brussels and washington based international crisis group called on the eu , u.s. and un to take urgent action including an " aggressive public and private diplomatic offensive " aimed at easing the situation .
" it is too late to prevent substantial ethnic cleansing , " said the group , while calling on the eu to engage sudan 's neighbours in an attempt to ease the passage of aid and aid workers to the region .
the sudanese government recently announced that it would be allowing better access for humanitarian groups - granting three month visas .
an eu mission to the country has been mooted for some time , although some in brussels are keen to see the african union take a lead role .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .

" we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said .

" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .

" we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .

" we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .

" we can not help but be conscious of the symbolism , at this time , of reaching out a hand to a country whose population is overwhelmingly muslim , " patten said .
underlining the strategic importance of the upcoming commission report on turkey , which will be released next autumn , the commissioner stated : " i look forward to the debate preceding the commission ’ s opinion on the matter in the autumn .
in making it , we will be conscious that we potentially pave the way for a very different eu – and that should be squarely and honestly confronted . "
in his speech , the uk commissioner avoided predicting the exact content of the commission 's report , which will evaluate whether ankara complies with the eu 's criteria on human rights and democracy .
but he strongly rejected defining the eu as a " christian " club - which would make it impossible for turkey as an islamic country to join .
on the basis of the commission 's opinion in the autumn , eu leaders will decide during a summit in december whether or not to start formal accession negotiations with turkey .

a € 300 million surveillance and communications network , with over 1,000 outdoor cameras and two-way microphones will only be able to be tested in the final weeks before the event , which takes place from aug .

under new measures that came into force on saturday , greek cypriots living on the island would still have to present their passports .
this decision has reportedly angered greek cypriot officials , particularly after the cyprus commissioner markos kyprianou was refused entry into the turkish part on friday , unless he showed his passport .
however , talat added that the issue of whether to allow greek cypriots to cross without showing their passports is still being examined .
cyprus joined the eu on may 1 , but eu law only applies to the greek cypriot part , after a un blueprint for the island ’ s reunification was rejected by the greek side last month .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.05.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc patten : eu handling of turkey crucial to avert islam-west clash speaking at the oxford center for islamic studies , the eu 's external relations commissioner chris patten argued that the correct treatment of turkey by the eu would help avert the scenario of a " clash of civilizations " between the western and islamic world - as famously predicted by the political scientist samuel huntington in 1993 .
" we can not help but be conscious of the symbolism , at this time , of reaching out a hand to a country whose population is overwhelmingly muslim , " patten said .
underlining the strategic importance of the upcoming commission report on turkey , which will be released next autumn , the commissioner stated : " i look forward to the debate preceding the commission ’ s opinion on the matter in the autumn .
in making it , we will be conscious that we potentially pave the way for a very different eu – and that should be squarely and honestly confronted . "
in his speech , the uk commissioner avoided predicting the exact content of the commission 's report , which will evaluate whether ankara complies with the eu 's criteria on human rights and democracy .
but he strongly rejected defining the eu as a " christian " club - which would make it impossible for turkey as an islamic country to join .
on the basis of the commission 's opinion in the autumn , eu leaders will decide during a summit in december whether or not to start formal accession negotiations with turkey .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed .

greece has asked nato to provide security for the olympics . with its long coastline , athens would like the organization to help patrol the sea .
twelve of its airborne early warning aircraft -lrb- awacs -rrb- will also be on standby to help greece with air surveillance .

each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

but the role of christianity still blocks agreement . though the ministers left brussels without any final agreement , they said they had made way on the key question of voting powers , one of the issues preventing the eu constitution from being made reality . " our continuing discussions see a consensus on that issue broadening , " irish prime minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters . the draft document foresees that a double majority of 50 percent of eu states representing at least 60 percent of the total population can decide votes in the eu council of ministers .

the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .

beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .

it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

carved out carrots , tuned up turnips and a rattle of radish are not exactly your typical orchestra instruments .
but a group from vienna is proving that veggies not only taste good , they sound good too . forget marinated sound ideas and canned listening habits - there 's a new music waiting to be discovered .
the viennese vegetable orchestra has set out to prove that vegetables are good for you in more ways than one .
featuring a line-up of nine different instruments carved and peeled from ordinary garden varieties , the austrian ensemble shows just how tubers can toot , radishes rattle and salad shakes .
since 1998 the three men and six women making up the world 's first -lrb- and only ? -rrb- vegetable orchestra have been touring the world , demonstrating that there 's more to music than the sounds traditional instruments produce .
using simple kitchen utensils , they turn cucumbers into cuke-o-phones , eggplants into cymbals and carrots into flutes .
each instrument has its own unique sound , and when blown , banged and rubbed together they create an interesting , entirely new blend .
in the ensemble 's own words , their self-composed melodies present a " transfer of electronic music pieces and structures to the instruments of the vegetable garden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrot sticks - not your ordinary lunch-box variety .
sounds like dinner time for audiences , there 's more to the group 's performance than a night at the symphony .
at a hamburg concert over the weekend , several listeners expressed amazement at the sound one can produce from a cucumber , others commented on the raw vegetable aroma accompanying the tunes .
that 's not surprising , considering the orchestra uses 40 kilos of vegetables for every concert .
each one is freshly sliced and peeled no sooner than an hour before each performance .
size , texture and water content are vital to achieving the correct sound , says matthias meinharter , who plays a violin fashioned from leeks .
to keep the veggies from drying out during the performance , the musicians drape damp cloths around them .
but because the instruments are organic , nothing is predictable and occasionally one of them fails to create the right sound . as a result , each performance is different .
it 's really a constantly evolving type of experimental sound .
and for those listeners who grow hungry listening to leeks , potatoes and peppers , at the end of the performance all the instruments are diced up and turned into a vegetable stew .
now that 's a recipe for success . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when plants say " ouch " with a laser-driven microphone , scientists in bonn have found that flowers whimper when a leaf is cut and cucumbers squeal when they get sick .

carved out carrots , tuned up turnips and a rattle of radish are not exactly your typical orchestra instruments .
but a group from vienna is proving that veggies not only taste good , they sound good too . forget marinated sound ideas and canned listening habits - there 's a new music waiting to be discovered .
the viennese vegetable orchestra has set out to prove that vegetables are good for you in more ways than one .
featuring a line-up of nine different instruments carved and peeled from ordinary garden varieties , the austrian ensemble shows just how tubers can toot , radishes rattle and salad shakes .
since 1998 the three men and six women making up the world 's first -lrb- and only ? -rrb- vegetable orchestra have been touring the world , demonstrating that there 's more to music than the sounds traditional instruments produce .
using simple kitchen utensils , they turn cucumbers into cuke-o-phones , eggplants into cymbals and carrots into flutes .
each instrument has its own unique sound , and when blown , banged and rubbed together they create an interesting , entirely new blend .
in the ensemble 's own words , their self-composed melodies present a " transfer of electronic music pieces and structures to the instruments of the vegetable garden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrot sticks - not your ordinary lunch-box variety .
sounds like dinner time for audiences , there 's more to the group 's performance than a night at the symphony .
at a hamburg concert over the weekend , several listeners expressed amazement at the sound one can produce from a cucumber , others commented on the raw vegetable aroma accompanying the tunes .
that 's not surprising , considering the orchestra uses 40 kilos of vegetables for every concert .
each one is freshly sliced and peeled no sooner than an hour before each performance .
size , texture and water content are vital to achieving the correct sound , says matthias meinharter , who plays a violin fashioned from leeks .
to keep the veggies from drying out during the performance , the musicians drape damp cloths around them .
but because the instruments are organic , nothing is predictable and occasionally one of them fails to create the right sound . as a result , each performance is different .
it 's really a constantly evolving type of experimental sound .
and for those listeners who grow hungry listening to leeks , potatoes and peppers , at the end of the performance all the instruments are diced up and turned into a vegetable stew .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism .

the viennese vegetable orchestra has set out to prove that vegetables are good for you in more ways than one .
featuring a line-up of nine different instruments carved and peeled from ordinary garden varieties , the austrian ensemble shows just how tubers can toot , radishes rattle and salad shakes .
since 1998 the three men and six women making up the world 's first -lrb- and only ? -rrb- vegetable orchestra have been touring the world , demonstrating that there 's more to music than the sounds traditional instruments produce .

sounds like dinner time for audiences , there 's more to the group 's performance than a night at the symphony .
at a hamburg concert over the weekend , several listeners expressed amazement at the sound one can produce from a cucumber , others commented on the raw vegetable aroma accompanying the tunes .
that 's not surprising , considering the orchestra uses 40 kilos of vegetables for every concert .
each one is freshly sliced and peeled no sooner than an hour before each performance .
size , texture and water content are vital to achieving the correct sound , says matthias meinharter , who plays a violin fashioned from leeks .
to keep the veggies from drying out during the performance , the musicians drape damp cloths around them .
but because the instruments are organic , nothing is predictable and occasionally one of them fails to create the right sound . as a result , each performance is different .
it 's really a constantly evolving type of experimental sound .

the court accepted the motion put forth by german retailer and defendant karstadtquelle to dismiss the case because it did not fall under the court 's auspices , the company which now owns some of the family 's assets said in a statement monday .
" the difficulty with the plaintiff 's argument is that none of karstadt 's subsidiaries are themselves doing business in new york , " u.s. district judge william g. bassler wrote in his dismissal .
" the assertion of jurisdiction ... would seriously trespass on the sovereignty of germany and the integrity of its own legal system , " he said while adding that evidence suggested the wertheim family had indeed been defrauded during the nazi-era .
the u.s. case had been filed by the daughter and grandson of günther wortham -lrb- previously wertheim -rrb- , who owned a chain of department stores in berlin .
in 1938 the family was forced to sell all its shares to a non-jewish consortium .
the wertheim descendents , who now live in the united states , alleged the original founders were defrauded of their post-war restitution claims when the wertheim stores were sold to the hertie chain in 1951 and then again when karstadt bought hertie and its wertheim subsidiary in 1994 .
they are seeking at least $ 150 million in damages from karstadt and have said they will file an appeal and pursue the case in german courts . dw-world.de berlin library caught up in controversial legal battle controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .

the companies now have two weeks to respond to the claims that a 50-50 tie-up would result in unfair dominance in the recording industry .
bertelsmann 's music publishing group , bmg , said it was examining the eu 's concerns , but said in a statement on tuesday that " the merger will not impede competition . "
if the two companies do go through with the deal , it would leave only four global music majors holding about 80 percent of the market .
similar concerns derailed merger plans between emi group plc and warner music group inc. four years ago .
the eu has until july 22 to reach a final decision regarding the merger . dw-world.de bertelsmann plans asia push despite a global slump on the advertising and music market , germany-based bertelsmann is looking towards a major expansion in asia this year .

the new set of rules , originally drafted in 2000 to help recruit talented immigrants to fill a shortage of skilled labor , has become bogged down in fears that the law allows foreign extremists to enter the country .
an ensuing partisan dispute broke out with the conservatives linking any agreement on immigration to demands for tougher measures against terror suspects .

in an attempt to find a compromise , schröder 's social democrats have hinted there might be room for discussion on the issue .
but the junior coalition partner , the greens , have adamantly opposed such measures and have signaled they would not sign on to such a law .
after years of talks and two failed attempts to push through the package , schröder said if no deal is reached during this final round , he will go ahead without the opposition 's approval and try to introduce those aspects of the bill which do not require the support of the upper house of parliament , where the opposition has the majority . dw-world.de schröder said ready to deal on immigration ahead of top-level talks on germany 's controversial immigration law , opposition members are calling for the imprisonment of top terror suspects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.05.2004 deutsche telekom to buy u.s. mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom expects more mobile phone growth in america .
deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?
deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies .

carved out carrots , tuned up turnips and a rattle of radish are not exactly your typical orchestra instruments .
but a group from vienna is proving that veggies not only taste good , they sound good too . forget marinated sound ideas and canned listening habits - there 's a new music waiting to be discovered .
the viennese vegetable orchestra has set out to prove that vegetables are good for you in more ways than one .
featuring a line-up of nine different instruments carved and peeled from ordinary garden varieties , the austrian ensemble shows just how tubers can toot , radishes rattle and salad shakes .
since 1998 the three men and six women making up the world 's first -lrb- and only ? -rrb- vegetable orchestra have been touring the world , demonstrating that there 's more to music than the sounds traditional instruments produce .
using simple kitchen utensils , they turn cucumbers into cuke-o-phones , eggplants into cymbals and carrots into flutes .
each instrument has its own unique sound , and when blown , banged and rubbed together they create an interesting , entirely new blend .
in the ensemble 's own words , their self-composed melodies present a " transfer of electronic music pieces and structures to the instruments of the vegetable garden . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc schröder starts make-or-break immigration talks chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday launched a final round of negotiations with opposition leaders in the hopes of reaching a last-chance compromise on a complex and controversial immigration law .
the new set of rules , originally drafted in 2000 to help recruit talented immigrants to fill a shortage of skilled labor , has become bogged down in fears that the law allows foreign extremists to enter the country .
an ensuing partisan dispute broke out with the conservatives linking any agreement on immigration to demands for tougher measures against terror suspects .
many prominent opposition politicians have called for a proposal allowing for foreigners who are deemed dangerous to be held up to two years in custody .
in an attempt to find a compromise , schröder 's social democrats have hinted there might be room for discussion on the issue .
but the junior coalition partner , the greens , have adamantly opposed such measures and have signaled they would not sign on to such a law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.05.2004 deutsche telekom to buy u.s. mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom expects more mobile phone growth in america .
deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?
deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies .

deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?
deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies .

the court accepted the motion put forth by german retailer and defendant karstadtquelle to dismiss the case because it did not fall under the court 's auspices , the company which now owns some of the family 's assets said in a statement monday .
" the difficulty with the plaintiff 's argument is that none of karstadt 's subsidiaries are themselves doing business in new york , " u.s. district judge william g. bassler wrote in his dismissal .
" the assertion of jurisdiction ... would seriously trespass on the sovereignty of germany and the integrity of its own legal system , " he said while adding that evidence suggested the wertheim family had indeed been defrauded during the nazi-era .
the u.s. case had been filed by the daughter and grandson of günther wortham -lrb- previously wertheim -rrb- , who owned a chain of department stores in berlin .
in 1938 the family was forced to sell all its shares to a non-jewish consortium .
the wertheim descendents , who now live in the united states , alleged the original founders were defrauded of their post-war restitution claims when the wertheim stores were sold to the hertie chain in 1951 and then again when karstadt bought hertie and its wertheim subsidiary in 1994 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.05.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc declining domestic demand undermines german growth germany 's economy grew by 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2004 , according to the federal statistics office .
the increase is solely the result of strong exports and a continuing high demand for german goods abroad while domestic demand declined in the first part of the year , the data showed on tuesday .
high unemployment and uncertainty over government reform plans as well as rocketing oil prices contributed to a decline in consumer spending within germany , the statistics office reported .
in fact , domestic demand contracted by 0.4 percent compared to the previous three months .

the court accepted the motion put forth by german retailer and defendant karstadtquelle to dismiss the case because it did not fall under the court 's auspices , the company which now owns some of the family 's assets said in a statement monday .
" the difficulty with the plaintiff 's argument is that none of karstadt 's subsidiaries are themselves doing business in new york , " u.s. district judge william g. bassler wrote in his dismissal .
" the assertion of jurisdiction ... would seriously trespass on the sovereignty of germany and the integrity of its own legal system , " he said while adding that evidence suggested the wertheim family had indeed been defrauded during the nazi-era .
the u.s. case had been filed by the daughter and grandson of günther wortham -lrb- previously wertheim -rrb- , who owned a chain of department stores in berlin .
in 1938 the family was forced to sell all its shares to a non-jewish consortium .
the wertheim descendents , who now live in the united states , alleged the original founders were defrauded of their post-war restitution claims when the wertheim stores were sold to the hertie chain in 1951 and then again when karstadt bought hertie and its wertheim subsidiary in 1994 .
they are seeking at least $ 150 million in damages from karstadt and have said they will file an appeal and pursue the case in german courts . dw-world.de berlin library caught up in controversial legal battle controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

" i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

but the role of christianity still blocks agreement . though the ministers left brussels without any final agreement , they said they had made way on the key question of voting powers , one of the issues preventing the eu constitution from being made reality . " our continuing discussions see a consensus on that issue broadening , " irish prime minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters . the draft document foresees that a double majority of 50 percent of eu states representing at least 60 percent of the total population can decide votes in the eu council of ministers .
but countries such as spain and poland have rejected the plan as giving too much weight to larger states .
for their part , germany , france and britain are trying to stick as close as possible to the draft proposal . " everyone was willing to move to a double majority , german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
" there were different views on the figures … we wo n't accept anything nonsensical , but today 's discussion was within reasonable bands . " religion divisive none of the member states have budged on the role christianity should play in the constitution .
the czech republic , italy , lithuania , malta , poland , portugal and slovakia had just before the session sent a letter to the irish eu presidency calling for the meeting to address the hotly debated issue . " the amendment we ask for is aimed to recognize a historical truth , " the foreign ministers from mainly roman catholic countries wrote .
" we do not want to disregard either the secular nature -lrb- of the eu -rrb- … or the respect of any other religious or philosophical belief . " the current draft refers to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance . " france and belgium , where church and state are strictly kept separate , have been the most vociferous opponents to mentioning religion in the document . the irish eu presidency aims to propose compromises on the remaining issues hindering adoption of the constitution shortly before the next eu summit on june 17-18 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

but the role of christianity still blocks agreement . though the ministers left brussels without any final agreement , they said they had made way on the key question of voting powers , one of the issues preventing the eu constitution from being made reality . " our continuing discussions see a consensus on that issue broadening , " irish prime minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters . the draft document foresees that a double majority of 50 percent of eu states representing at least 60 percent of the total population can decide votes in the eu council of ministers .
but countries such as spain and poland have rejected the plan as giving too much weight to larger states .
for their part , germany , france and britain are trying to stick as close as possible to the draft proposal . " everyone was willing to move to a double majority , german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
" there were different views on the figures … we wo n't accept anything nonsensical , but today 's discussion was within reasonable bands . " religion divisive none of the member states have budged on the role christianity should play in the constitution .
the czech republic , italy , lithuania , malta , poland , portugal and slovakia had just before the session sent a letter to the irish eu presidency calling for the meeting to address the hotly debated issue . " the amendment we ask for is aimed to recognize a historical truth , " the foreign ministers from mainly roman catholic countries wrote .
" we do not want to disregard either the secular nature -lrb- of the eu -rrb- … or the respect of any other religious or philosophical belief . " the current draft refers to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance . " france and belgium , where church and state are strictly kept separate , have been the most vociferous opponents to mentioning religion in the document . the irish eu presidency aims to propose compromises on the remaining issues hindering adoption of the constitution shortly before the next eu summit on june 17-18 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december .

deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?
deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

" it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?
deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .

the viennese vegetable orchestra has set out to prove that vegetables are good for you in more ways than one .
featuring a line-up of nine different instruments carved and peeled from ordinary garden varieties , the austrian ensemble shows just how tubers can toot , radishes rattle and salad shakes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.05.2004 deutsche telekom to buy u.s. mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom expects more mobile phone growth in america .
deutsche telekom said on tuesday it planned to buy mobile phone networks from cingular wireless for $ 2.5 billion to expand its business in the united states . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest phone company , said it would buy cingular 's networks in california and nevada to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing american market .
the acquisition will end an agreement with cingular which allowed both companies to use the other 's networks . " we are certain that this investment will accelerate the long-term profitable growth of our u.s. mobile business , " deutsche telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke said . deutsche telekom said the deal was made possible by cingular 's impending purchase of at & t wireless which will increase the company 's nationwide network capacity .
telekom will pay cingular $ 2.3 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- and will subtract $ 200 million for ending the network-sharing venture .
the payments will be made in early 2005 .
the bonn-based telekom expects to earn " at least $ 1.2 billion " from cingular over the next four years as it continues the network for its california and nevada mobile traffic . telekom said it will also spend $ 180 million for the wireless spectrum to increase its capacities in various american cities . no more debt reduction ? the purchases end a phase of thrifty cost-cutting for the german company and the cingular deal will be the largest acquisition under ricke 's stewardship since he took over in 2002 .
his savings measures have allowed the firm to lower its debt levels from € 60 billion to around € 44 billion .
chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick said he did n't expect the new acquisitions to hurt deutsche telekom 's credit rating . " they need access to these areas because the u.s. is what 's driving growth , " friedrich diel , a fund manager at frankfurt trust investment in frankfurt , told bloomberg news .
" the investment makes sense . " deutsche telekom began delving into the american market in 2001 when it took over voicestream wireless for $ 35 billion .
its u.s. operations have since become telekom 's fastest-growing unit .
the company has pegged its hopes on the potential for further expansion , saying that whereas 80 percent of the population in europe already has mobile phones , only 55 percent in the united states does . telekom said it expected its number of u.s. customers to increase to 16 million by the end of the year from 14.3 million currently .
in ten years it hopes to double that figure to around 35 million customers . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom goes shopping : good business or bad habit ?
deutsche telekom wants to spend € 1 billion for complete control of polish mobile operator ptc .
but it remains unclear whether the deal shows the german giant is back in form or simply returning to indulgent tendencies .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said .

" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .

" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot .

but the role of christianity still blocks agreement . though the ministers left brussels without any final agreement , they said they had made way on the key question of voting powers , one of the issues preventing the eu constitution from being made reality . " our continuing discussions see a consensus on that issue broadening , " irish prime minister brian cowen , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters . the draft document foresees that a double majority of 50 percent of eu states representing at least 60 percent of the total population can decide votes in the eu council of ministers .
but countries such as spain and poland have rejected the plan as giving too much weight to larger states .
for their part , germany , france and britain are trying to stick as close as possible to the draft proposal . " everyone was willing to move to a double majority , german foreign minister joschka fischer said .
" there were different views on the figures … we wo n't accept anything nonsensical , but today 's discussion was within reasonable bands . " religion divisive none of the member states have budged on the role christianity should play in the constitution .
the czech republic , italy , lithuania , malta , poland , portugal and slovakia had just before the session sent a letter to the irish eu presidency calling for the meeting to address the hotly debated issue . " the amendment we ask for is aimed to recognize a historical truth , " the foreign ministers from mainly roman catholic countries wrote .
" we do not want to disregard either the secular nature -lrb- of the eu -rrb- … or the respect of any other religious or philosophical belief . " the current draft refers to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance . " france and belgium , where church and state are strictly kept separate , have been the most vociferous opponents to mentioning religion in the document . the irish eu presidency aims to propose compromises on the remaining issues hindering adoption of the constitution shortly before the next eu summit on june 17-18 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n.

he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.05.2004 inquiry blames organizational failures for beagle loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lost in space an official probe into europe 's doomed beagle 2 mars lander , which vanished without a single bleep last december , has blamed mismanagement for the disaster .
but , it has n't ruled out another mission to the red planet . on december 19 , britain 's much-hyped beagle 2 martian lander designed to look specifically for life on the red planet detached successfully from its mother ship , the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- mars express orbiter . the jubilation among scientists however was short-lived .
the tiny space probe , which was supposed to touch down on mars on christmas day , went completely silent and did n't send back a signal . hope finally turned to resignation and by february , scientists and engineers accepted that their ambitious mission had been lost .
it was speculated that beagle 2 may have smashed into the martian surface as its parachute may have failed or faulty wiring could have reduced it to ashes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression showing the beagle 2 lander on mars .
beagle 2 's exact fate may never be known , but an independent official investigation jointly commissioned by the british government and the esa into the doomed mission attempted this week to pinpoint the lessons that could be learned from the debacle . the full report into the loss of the beagle 2 mars lander will not be published in order to protect sensitive commercial interests behind the project .
but the commission , which has interviewed the major participants in the mission , has issued a list of recommendations generated from the probe . organizational failures at fault britain 's science minister , lord david john sainsbury said that no single technical failure was to blame but suggested that scientists may have overestimated the success of the ambitious project . " it 's now clear that the very high potential scientific benefits of the project may have contributed to a collective institutional underestimate of ways to identify and mitigate the risks , " sainsbury said . the inquiry also lay the blame on organizational shortcomings . " failure was institutional , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told a media briefing in london .
" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

" we were working in a system which was n't right , where the organizational structures were n't right and people did n't have the right level of empowerment , authority or resources . " insufficient funding at the wrong time the british government invested more than $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.1 million -rrb- into the british-built martian lander , while the remaining $ 80 million was financed by private companies . however beagle 2 's funding levels were hardly criticized by the inquiry .
it did however call for future missions to be better " scoped " early on in the planning process to anticipate any possible problems . though beagle 2 's engineering was achieved in the tightest of schedules , it was widely believed that end-to-end testing of the probe before the launch was insufficient . " i do n't think that , overall , beagle had too little money ; it just did n't have it at the right time , " southwood said in a reference to the fact that support from both the british government and esa came late in the life of the project .
" it should have had it at the beginning and there should have been a contracting authority to make sure the mission was put together in a way that allowed managers to control costs effectively , " he said . " we were right to have a go " named after the ship that carried charles darwin on his celebrated voyage , beagle 2 was the brainchild of professor colin pillinger of the open university in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the esa 's mars express orbiter the size of a garden barbecue set , beagle 2 was meant to spend six months probing and analyzing rocks on the martian surface with the help of a robotic arm and send the data back to earth via the esa 's mars express orbiter -lrb- photo -rrb- . pillinger however has remained undeterred by beagle 2 's disappearance .
" we gave beagle the very best shot we could within the constraints that were placed upon us , " he said .
" we were right to have a go . " another mars mission ? pillinger urged esa to launch a replacement as soon as possible and has called for the creation of a british space agency such as nasa in the united states . " we 've heard from the recommendations that if we do n't make decisions early , we end up in the situation that you have no way of retiring the risks , " pillinger said .
" you have to give the engineers a chance .
so i am asking esa to make the earliest possible decision to go to mars again . " that could happen sooner than expected . despite the odds - two thirds of all missions to mars have ended in failure - sainsbury has indicated they might give the mission another shot . " i am sure we will go back to mars and we need to look at the best way of doing this and i hope something like beagle will be part of it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mars express finds ice and water european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so . the incidents came to light earlier this year when the 18-year-old victim , known only by his first name , dieter , confided in a school psychologist . he was allegedly beaten , stripped and humiliated about twice a week for around two months .
each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

but france has expressed reservations whether it would make iraq " truly sovereign . " hoping to pave the way for a transition to a new iraqi-run authority on june 30 , washington and london submitted the draft resolution to the u.n. security council on monday .
the measure aims to bolster international support for the new government in baghdad , but some governments are likely to take issue with wide latitude given to the u.s.-led forces in iraq . the resolution would allow american and british troops to operate almost indefinitely in the country and would let them " take all necessary measure to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq , including by preventing and deterring terrorism . "
france and germany , both strong opponents of the war , are likely to want a more definite timeframe for the withdrawal of the occupying troops or clearer language allowing the iraqis more say in ordering their departure .
french foreign minister michel barnier said paris was concerned the interim government would not be " truly sovereign " if it did not have the backing of the iraqi people . " i think the transfer of power to the new iraqi government from july 1 should be a complete , sincere and clear transfer , even if there is naturally , for a certain time , a sharing of responsibilities on security until the january elections , " barnier told journalists after the resolution was submitted . a round-table discussion ? in an interview with the le figaro newspaper , he suggested holding a round-table meeting to " verify how representative " the authority would be .
he said the new resolution must have a triple objective of returning sovereignty , " clearly marking " the authority of the united nations and launching a political and economic reconstruction process in iraq . other countries were more reserved in their assessment of the draft text .
germany 's ambassador to the united nation gunter pleuger said the draft resolution was " a good basis for discussion " and other members of the security council said they wanted to wait to hear from the u.n. 's representative in iraq lakhdar brahimi . brahimi is expected to return to the united nations by the end of the month to name a president and other cabinet members for the transitional government in iraq . in an attempt to get france and germany behind the resolution , british foreign secretary jack straw met with his french and german counterparts in brussels on monday .
he said there had been plenty of negotiations before the draft was submitted with the aim of reaching a quick consensus . " we have entered into the discussion with partners in the hope that we will be able to reach agreement and reach agreement pretty soon , " he told journalists . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as spain withdraws , italy pledges to keep troops in iraq even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured .

each time different groups of fellow students would join in , and on several occasions , one of them captured the torture with a digital camera . only a couple of weeks after he joined the werner-von-siemens vocational school in the town of hildesheim near hanover for a one-year course , he was taken to a storeroom , beaten , forced to take his clothes off , to eat chalk and cigarette filters . sometimes he was forced to cover his head with a bucket . as time went on , the incidents became more frequent ; the prosecutor says by the end he was being maltreated almost daily . he had bruises and cuts on his face and body and began to suffer from psychological problems . four of the 11 teenagers charged are considered to have been the ringleaders and have been held on remand since early february . the victim has claimed that one of the teachers regularly failed to come to his assistance , although he knew what was going on . this is the third case of serious maltreatment of school students to come to light in the last few months in which the participants have filmed their actions . according to a recent study , most violence in schools is at a much less extreme , but 13 percent of school students admitted having robbed other students or forced them to part with something . eight percent said they had threatened another student with a knife or a gun . the trial will take place behind closed doors , because the accused are minors , and is expected to last three days . michael lawton -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed .

the viennese vegetable orchestra has set out to prove that vegetables are good for you in more ways than one .

at a hamburg concert over the weekend , several listeners expressed amazement at the sound one can produce from a cucumber , others commented on the raw vegetable aroma accompanying the tunes .
that 's not surprising , considering the orchestra uses 40 kilos of vegetables for every concert .
each one is freshly sliced and peeled no sooner than an hour before each performance .
size , texture and water content are vital to achieving the correct sound , says matthias meinharter , who plays a violin fashioned from leeks .
to keep the veggies from drying out during the performance , the musicians drape damp cloths around them .
but because the instruments are organic , nothing is predictable and occasionally one of them fails to create the right sound . as a result , each performance is different .
it 's really a constantly evolving type of experimental sound .

waving goodbye to uk ownership ?
after the united states , britain is the world 's second biggest arms exporter .
defence and aerospace groups such as bae systems and rolls-royce are major players in the field , generating billions of pounds in sales and employing hundreds of thousands of staff .
but could much of britain 's defence industrial base be on the verge of falling into foreign hands ?
the european commission is expected to rule on wednesday on the £ 309m -lrb- $ 553m -rrb- takeover of the uk 's only tank builder , alvis , by us defence firm general dynamics .
the ruling comes the week after uk engineering group gkn revealed it was in talks to offload its stake in helicopter maker agusta westland to its italian partner finmeccanica , signalling an end to british ownership in the industry .

the ruling comes the week after uk engineering group gkn revealed it was in talks to offload its stake in helicopter maker agusta westland to its italian partner finmeccanica , signalling an end to british ownership in the industry .

brussels ' objections to the deal remain confidential , but are understood to centre on market share .
combined , the two would rival universal for top spot in the $ 30bn industry .
but some fear that the consolidation would damage competition and give the big firms too much control over the emerging online music market .
as well as responding on paper within two weeks , sony and bertelsmann - bmg 's parent company - can call for a closed-door hearing .
that could happen in mid-june , with the european commission 's final decision due on 22 july .
consolidation the argument behind the merger is that competition from dvds and other media , piracy and the challenge of the online environment means consolidation is inevitable .
the two firms say they could save $ 300m a year in annual costs .
on recent figures , their combined market share would be 25.2 % , just a whisker behind universal 's 25.9 % .
a merger would create a stable of artists including beyonce knowles and bruce springsteen from sony and justin timberlake and elvis presley from bertelsmann .
the sheer size , opponents say , is precisely the problem - not least because the ec blocked an emi-time warner tie-up four years ago on similar grounds .
the merger would mean four companies controlled 80 % of the global music market .
sony 's strong position in consumer electronics would give the combined entity too much power over the way the sale of online music evolves , according to some critics - including apple computer , keen to protect its itunes online music store .

all services last year , the committee produced a series of draft recommendations .
one of these involved doing away with the districts and making the county council responsible for all services .
the other options did away with the county council and consisted of various combinations of the craven , harrogate , hambleton , richmondshire , ryedale and scarborough districts .
selby would be moved into the east riding .
all purpose authorities already exist in all other parts of the yorkshire and the humber region , including york .
on tuesday , the boundary committee is expected to produce two options which will be put to the voters of north yorkshire at the same time as the assembly referendum in the autumn .

the boundary committee for england has revealed there will be a single council for lancashire or seven smaller ones if there is a yes vote for the assembly .
while cheshire could have a similar single authority or three councils .
deputy prime minister john prescott will have the final say before the assembly referendum in the autumn .
one tier the government believes if the region votes for a regional assembly there should only be one other tier of local government .
the committee has revealed the following options .
one idea for lancashire is to have an all-purpose council for most of the county taking in more than a million people but retaining the existing blackburn with darwen unitary authority and an extended blackpool taking in fylde and wyre .
the other option would see seven councils again including an expanded blackpool along with a morecambe and lancaster council also taking part of south cumbria .
consultation period ormskirk , in lancashire , would join sefton , in merseyside , while west lancashire -lrb- which covers skelmersdale -rrb- would amalgamate with wigan , in greater manchester .
cheshire could have a single council covering 670,000 people or three councils grouping macclesfield with congleton , vale royal with crewe and chester with ellesmere port .
an idea to join the whitworth area with rochdale has been ditched .
the ideas to join skelmersdale with wigan and ormskirk with sefton were hotly opposed during a consultation period last winter but committee officials have stuck with their original plan .

the resignation was widely expected , but president roh had tried to persuade him to endorse cabinet changes first .
president roh said the replacement of the unification , culture and health ministers would now have to wait .
mr goh had reportedly argued that he should not recommend ministers as an outgoing prime minister .
mr roh accepted mr goh 's resignation at a breakfast meeting on tuesday .
his exit is a political set-back for the president , who had repeatedly asked him to approve changes to his cabinet which would have rewarded three senior members of the uri party .
the uri party won the majority of seats during a parliamentary election last month , and mr roh has subsequently joined it .
now mr roh will have to wait for a new prime minister to endorse his cabinet changes .
his reported choice for this post is controversial , but must be approved by the national assembly .
he is widely thought to favour kim hyuk-kyu , a long-time member of the opposition grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- who switched to the uri party this year .
the gnp has argued that his switch showed that he was opportunistic and lacked integrity .
finance minister and deputy prime minister lee jun-hae will assume mr goh 's duties until a new prime minister is appointed , the presidential spokesman said .

the two countries are already members of the g20 bloc of developing states , designed to counter us and european bargaining power on trade .
in a statement issued in beijing , the two said they would work to ensure the world trade organisation 's negotiations " reflected everyone 's interests " .
brazil 's president , luiz inacio lula da silva , is in china to heighten economic links between the countries .
the two countries are among the main protagonists in the g20 's efforts to make world trade talks more beneficial to developing countries , not least the grouping 's defeat of eu and us proposals in cancun in 2003 .
brazil and china already have a strong trading relationship , worth $ 8bn in 2003 and more than five times the level of 2000 .
brazil 's exports of primary products such as soy and iron are being sucked in by china 's rapidly-growing economy .
in domestic terms , the fruits of the six-day trip are making themselves felt .
brazil 's companhia vale do rio doce -lrb- cvrd -rrb- , the world 's number one iron ore miner , signed a $ 5bn deal on tuesday .
cvrd will ship iron ore , alumina - a product of bauxite and a key ingredient in aluminium - and steel to feed china 's factories , while china ships back coke - a fuel derived from coal or petroleum - to fire the firm 's furnaces .
chinese firms will also help pay for a steel plant and an alumina refinery in the northeast of brazil .
