it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .

in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .

indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .

just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .

in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .

these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .

indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .
some may argue that they do this wherever they may be in the world but the czech republic offers that historical twist and a respect of hops and barley that germans can relate to . tradition and ingredients prove popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horse drawn carriages in old town square in prague , czech republic .
just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .
mrs. schröder-kopf can almost guarantee that her gerhard will have spent a good far while in one the city 's beerhouses after a visit .
indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .
some may argue that they do this wherever they may be in the world but the czech republic offers that historical twist and a respect of hops and barley that germans can relate to . tradition and ingredients prove popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horse drawn carriages in old town square in prague , czech republic .
just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

vladimir putin is set for another term as president after russians go to the polls on sunday .
but is there any real competition offering an alternative to the ex-kgb man ? the result of the general election on sunday is practically a foregone conclusion .
polls say vladimir putin will garner 70 to 80 percent of the russian electorate 's votes ; the strongest of his six challengers can only bank on 5 percent . the enthusiasm for the kgb agent-turned-politician stems from the public perception that putin put russia on the right road economically after he succeeded boris yeltsin as president in march 2000 .
since then , the country 's gross domestic product has risen every year at a rate of around 5 percent .
the economy , largely fed by oil and natural gas exports and foreign investors attracted by political stability and liberal reforms , has been robust .
inflation has been fairly low , and wages , pensions and foreign debts are largely paid on time . putin has pushed through needed reforms , key among them a law permitting the sale of farmland for the first time since the czarist era .
he reined in russia 's unruly regional leaders who had flourished under yeltsin as well as powerful heads of the business community .
those who did n't comply were chased into exile or thrown in jail , like oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky , currently biding his time in a moscow prison under charges of tax evasion . his power was further cemented by sweeping wins in december 's parliamentary elections that gave the kremlin-loyal united russia party a two-thirds majority in the duma , and effectively deprived opposition parties of influence over the president 's policies . developing a teflon-coating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three women hostages and one of their captors , a woman , are seen inside the theater seized by armed chechens in moscow , oct .

but putin has had to weather storms during his first term too .
he faced harsh criticism when he was perceived as reacting too slowly to the sinking of the russian atomic submarine and subsequent death of 118 sailors in the barents sea in august 2000 .
but he appears to have learned his lesson from that public relations disaster .
in october 2002 , when chechen rebels took over 800 moscow theatre-goers hostage , he handled the crisis with aplomb .
he emerged practically unscathed after security forces stormed the theatre and 129 hostages died - most of them succumbing to police nerve gas . despite criticism from human rights organizations , chechnya did n't turn into the achilles heel it had been for yeltsin , as violence remained relatively low .
at the same time , the sept .
11 attacks in washington and new york afforded putin an opportunity to forge closer ties to u.s. president george w. bush .
putin was able to defend the kremlin 's fight against chechen separatists in the breakaway republic as russia 's fight against terrorism . independent media silenced putin 's critics allege that he rules autocratically and is not committed to democracy .
civil liberties are said to be eroding .
the president has muzzled the country 's critical media , bringing television under state control and severely limiting russians ' access to independent news sources .
during a recent visit to moscow , u.s. secretary of state colin powell expressed concern about the lack of free media . putin 's grip remains tight .
while elsewhere cabinet revamps are interpreted as admissions of weakness , his reshuffle on tuesday was considered a move to further entrench the 51-year-old in power .
his new , streamlined assembly of ministers is dominated by prominent economic liberals and modernizers who will help putin push through more reforms after his almost certain reelection . putin 's opponents can only hope for low voter turnout on sunday . if less than 50 percent of the electorate casts a ballot , the vote will be declared invalid and new elections will be called .
the head of russia 's yabloko liberal party , grigory yavlinsky , has called on voters to boycott the poll , saying a boycott is " the citizen 's position , a moral position , an important signal to society . "

vladimir putin is set for another term as president after russians go to the polls on sunday .
but is there any real competition offering an alternative to the ex-kgb man ? the result of the general election on sunday is practically a foregone conclusion .
polls say vladimir putin will garner 70 to 80 percent of the russian electorate 's votes ; the strongest of his six challengers can only bank on 5 percent . the enthusiasm for the kgb agent-turned-politician stems from the public perception that putin put russia on the right road economically after he succeeded boris yeltsin as president in march 2000 .
since then , the country 's gross domestic product has risen every year at a rate of around 5 percent .
the economy , largely fed by oil and natural gas exports and foreign investors attracted by political stability and liberal reforms , has been robust .
inflation has been fairly low , and wages , pensions and foreign debts are largely paid on time . putin has pushed through needed reforms , key among them a law permitting the sale of farmland for the first time since the czarist era .
he reined in russia 's unruly regional leaders who had flourished under yeltsin as well as powerful heads of the business community .
those who did n't comply were chased into exile or thrown in jail , like oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky , currently biding his time in a moscow prison under charges of tax evasion . his power was further cemented by sweeping wins in december 's parliamentary elections that gave the kremlin-loyal united russia party a two-thirds majority in the duma , and effectively deprived opposition parties of influence over the president 's policies . developing a teflon-coating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three women hostages and one of their captors , a woman , are seen inside the theater seized by armed chechens in moscow , oct .
25 , 2002 .
but putin has had to weather storms during his first term too .
he faced harsh criticism when he was perceived as reacting too slowly to the sinking of the russian atomic submarine and subsequent death of 118 sailors in the barents sea in august 2000 .
but he appears to have learned his lesson from that public relations disaster .
in october 2002 , when chechen rebels took over 800 moscow theatre-goers hostage , he handled the crisis with aplomb .
he emerged practically unscathed after security forces stormed the theatre and 129 hostages died - most of them succumbing to police nerve gas . despite criticism from human rights organizations , chechnya did n't turn into the achilles heel it had been for yeltsin , as violence remained relatively low .
at the same time , the sept .
11 attacks in washington and new york afforded putin an opportunity to forge closer ties to u.s. president george w. bush .
putin was able to defend the kremlin 's fight against chechen separatists in the breakaway republic as russia 's fight against terrorism . independent media silenced putin 's critics allege that he rules autocratically and is not committed to democracy .
civil liberties are said to be eroding .
the president has muzzled the country 's critical media , bringing television under state control and severely limiting russians ' access to independent news sources .
during a recent visit to moscow , u.s. secretary of state colin powell expressed concern about the lack of free media . putin 's grip remains tight .
while elsewhere cabinet revamps are interpreted as admissions of weakness , his reshuffle on tuesday was considered a move to further entrench the 51-year-old in power .
his new , streamlined assembly of ministers is dominated by prominent economic liberals and modernizers who will help putin push through more reforms after his almost certain reelection . putin 's opponents can only hope for low voter turnout on sunday . if less than 50 percent of the electorate casts a ballot , the vote will be declared invalid and new elections will be called .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .
mrs. schröder-kopf can almost guarantee that her gerhard will have spent a good far while in one the city 's beerhouses after a visit .
indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .
some may argue that they do this wherever they may be in the world but the czech republic offers that historical twist and a respect of hops and barley that germans can relate to . tradition and ingredients prove popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horse drawn carriages in old town square in prague , czech republic .
just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .

in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .

just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .

in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .

these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .
mrs. schröder-kopf can almost guarantee that her gerhard will have spent a good far while in one the city 's beerhouses after a visit .
indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .
some may argue that they do this wherever they may be in the world but the czech republic offers that historical twist and a respect of hops and barley that germans can relate to . tradition and ingredients prove popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horse drawn carriages in old town square in prague , czech republic .
just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .
germans may not boast as many liters per person in their homeland as the czechs , but the figures do n't show the number of germans consuming in other lands .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .
mrs. schröder-kopf can almost guarantee that her gerhard will have spent a good far while in one the city 's beerhouses after a visit .
indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .

just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .

once renowned as the world 's most prolific nation of beer drinkers , germany has slipped from its pedestal .
the reason could be that more and more germans are crossing the border to sample the barley water of prague . prague is a city steeped in culture and history with its associations with literature , music and social values .
it is an ideal place for international politicians to meet and discuss the policies that will shape their collective futures and expand their understanding of each other .
however , when german european union commissioner günter verheugen is in town , there are other things that are in danger of expanding - his waistline for one . this is mainly due to another factor that expands on every visit , verheugen 's love of czech beer and food .
" my wife does not like this at all , " confessed the eu commissioner in an interview with germany 's spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frau verheugen may not be the only politician 's wife who might be wielding the rolling pin when her husband returns from a " business " trip to the czech capital .
mrs. schröder-kopf can almost guarantee that her gerhard will have spent a good far while in one the city 's beerhouses after a visit .
indeed it is the requisite for any successful trip to prague for the prominent visitor to indulge in some local hospitality . czechs top consumption league table the fact is that while the czech republic can not rightfully justify its claim that it produces the world 's best beer , it does however produce many a tipple that inspires even the proud german drinkers to quaff czech ales in large amounts .
in terms of consumption , the czechs put away enough lager to put them on the top of the drinking charts .
in 2003 , czechs - no doubt assisted by the legions of willing foreign assistants - managed to consume an average of 162 liters each , according to the brewing federation in prague , making it the best performance in terms of beer drinking in the world that year . germany could only stumble towards third place with an average of 123 liters per person , a few jars behind the mighty irish in second place who guzzled 146 liters each , mainly of the dublin brewed guinness no doubt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer garden in cologne .
it would surprise many that germany , a nation of dedicated beer drinkers , would flounder into a third spot in such a league table .
after all , with such a rich tradition of production and consumption stretching back centuries , the germans should easily be the last ones standing after all the other lightweights of the world are soundly snoring under the table .
how , then , can germany have slipped so far back ? promotion of beer tourism the main reason is likely to be the czech-instigated " beer path " which crosses the borders from the southern states of germany and france into bohemia and moravia and onto poland and slovakia .
organized by prague 's brewing federation , this cultural exchange program with a difference connects germany and the czech republic in the same way as the river elbe flows between the two countries … except this time it 's a flow of beer and a shared tradition of ancient brewing . the promotion of beer tourism has prompted masses of germans to combine one of their greatest loves with another - drinking and vacations .
some may argue that they do this wherever they may be in the world but the czech republic offers that historical twist and a respect of hops and barley that germans can relate to . tradition and ingredients prove popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horse drawn carriages in old town square in prague , czech republic .
just as in germany , beer is the national drink of the czechs .
there are more than 100 breweries in bohemia and moravia , brewing everything from dark malty beers to bright , crisp pilsners .
hops , malt and brewing water exist in unusually high quality throughout the republic , and this is the basis for its success . one of the most renowned of czech beers is brewed not far from the german border , in the industrial town pilsen , the famed urquell pilsner . first produced in 1842 , it still carries the name of the town in which it was created .
these days , the brewery is a popular stop for those germans crossing the border to taste the beer at its source . famous brands in original surroundings elsewhere , germans are lured to the town of ceske budejovice where the world famous budvar is produced .
the makers of the original budweiser , taken from the translated name of the town , are as famous for taking on the u.s. brewing giant anheuser bush who sells its own international recognized budweiser as they are for the beer itself .
as a result of the spat , the american beer , brought over by a czech emigrant , can not be sold under the budweiser name in the republic . with such a tradition , great tasting beer and close proximity to home , it 's no surprise that germans are heading into bohemia by the bus load to experience czech beer in its native land .
germans may not boast as many liters per person in their homeland as the czechs , but the figures do n't show the number of germans consuming in other lands .

marine christopher maddison , 24 , of scarborough , died on a river patrol on the al faw peninsular in march 2003 .
an internal inquiry has discovered the marine was killed by his own side after a series of operational errors .
the inquiry 's leaked report also criticised the original investigation as flawed and full of factual errors .
review recommended plymouth-based marine maddison died of shrapnel wounds after his landing craft came under fire .
the internal board of inquiry report was prompted by bbc one documentary fighting the war , which claimed to have unearthed new information that cast into doubt the belief that he died in combat .
bad planning , unreliable communications , inadequate equipment and poor leadership the mod 's board of inquiry view of the 3 commando operation in which marine maddison was killed the leaked report said marine maddison was the victim of a 3 commando operation plagued by " bad planning , unreliable communications , inadequate equipment and poor leadership " .
it said the ability to make sure everyone in the battlefield knew where everyone else was - known as battle space management - had broken down .
there was no chain of command , standard operational procedures were not used and communications were unreliable , the report said .
it recommended that some of the brigade 's practices should be reviewed .
' inaccurate findings ' the leaked report also criticised the initial investigation into marine maddison 's death by the mod 's special investigation branch -lrb- sib -rrb- .
it is disgraceful that we might never have known what happened to christopher , and we had the right to know christopher maddison 's mother julie " it is the board 's view that professional inadequacies , factual errors , a lack of rigorous investigation of the facts available at the time ... were the prime causes of the production of an inaccurate set of findings , " the report concluded .
marine maddison 's mother julie told bbc news : " it is disgraceful that we might never have known what happened to christopher , and we had the right to know .
" the military sometimes , i think , have this idea that once they have signed up a recruit they do not belong to us anymore .
but they are quite happy to send them home in a coffin . "
a spokeswoman for the mod said efforts were being made to minimise the chances of the incident being repeated .
she said the board of inquiry 's report was an internal document and as such , she could not comment on the reports of its specific contents .
however , the mod has confirmed that marines from 40 and 42 commando were on either side of the waterway where marine maddison 's 9 assault squadron was working .
he was one of a group of marines on a craft heading up an iraqi river which came within range of another group of marines equipped with anti-tank rockets .
they thought they were observing an enemy craft and fired a rocket which hit the craft .
marine maddison was injured and later died .

marine christopher maddison , 24 , of scarborough , died on a river patrol on the al faw peninsular in march 2003 .
an internal inquiry has discovered the marine was killed by his own side after a series of operational errors .
the inquiry 's leaked report also criticised the original investigation as flawed and full of factual errors .
review recommended plymouth-based marine maddison died of shrapnel wounds after his landing craft came under fire .
the internal board of inquiry report was prompted by bbc one documentary fighting the war , which claimed to have unearthed new information that cast into doubt the belief that he died in combat . "
bad planning , unreliable communications , inadequate equipment and poor leadership " the mod 's board of inquiry view of the 3 commando operation in which marine maddison was killed the leaked report said marine maddison was the victim of a 3 commando operation plagued by " bad planning , unreliable communications , inadequate equipment and poor leadership " .
it said the ability to make sure everyone in the battlefield knew where everyone else was - known as battle space management - had broken down .
there was no chain of command , standard operational procedures were not used and communications were unreliable , the report said .
it recommended that some of the brigade 's practices should be reviewed .
' inaccurate findings ' the leaked report also criticised the initial investigation into marine maddison 's death by the mod 's special investigation branch -lrb- sib -rrb- . "
it is disgraceful that we might never have known what happened to christopher , and we had the right to know " christopher maddison 's mother julie " it is the board 's view that professional inadequacies , factual errors , a lack of rigorous investigation of the facts available at the time ... were the prime causes of the production of an inaccurate set of findings , " the report concluded .
marine maddison 's mother julie told bbc news : " it is disgraceful that we might never have known what happened to christopher , and we had the right to know .
" the military sometimes , i think , have this idea that once they have signed up a recruit they do not belong to us anymore .
but they are quite happy to send them home in a coffin . "
a spokeswoman for the mod said efforts were being made to minimise the chances of the incident being repeated .
she said the board of inquiry 's report was an internal document and as such , she could not comment on the reports of its specific contents .
however , the mod has confirmed that marines from 40 and 42 commando were on either side of the waterway where marine maddison 's 9 assault squadron was working .
he was one of a group of marines on a craft heading up an iraqi river which came within range of another group of marines equipped with anti-tank rockets .
they thought they were observing an enemy craft and fired a rocket which hit the craft .
marine maddison was injured and later died .

they will target people dropping litter , including matches , cigarette ends and chewing gum , and dog owners who allow their pets to foul streets .
people who receive a fixed penalty notice have 14 days to pay .

" we had a cold snap recently which may have caused the pipes to expand and contract and then burst , or it could have been a tree root growing down .
we do not believe it is vandalism .
" our number one priority is the customers , who have been extremely patient .
we are now helping with the clean-up operation . "
thames water took at least 700 calls from customers complaining about the loss of water on friday .
six families were put in up hotels overnight while the rest stayed with friends or relatives .
among them were richard morley , his wife and two boys aged six and three , who were woken by a neighbour 's call at 0545 gmt on friday .
sandbags limit damage they managed to limit damage to their house by putting down sandbags , but their car was submerged up to the steering wheel .
he told bbc news online he was " taken aback " to find water up to his doorstep but said all the agencies involved had been very supportive .
he said : " we had the salvation army bringing sandwiches and cups of tea .
it was what you 'd imagine it was like in war time .
" the police marine response unit was there and some people had to be taken out by boat .
" we put sandbags on the door so most of the water was limited to the hallway and front of the lounge .
" but unfortunately , in some of the other houses , the water came in through the front door and washed all the way through to the back . "
loss adjusters have also been at the scene , trying to asses the extent of the damage .

but his opponents see him as an outsider and a menace - some have called him an amateur who lacks the dignity to be president .
the opposition has now made its move , after many months of ferocious political conflict , and removed him from office - at least for the time being .
" the attacks started three days after his inauguration , they never recognised him as president , " says yu jay-kun , an mp for the pro-roh uri party which physically blocked a vote on impeachment for three days .
in the end the president 's supporters were dragged out by security guards and the vote went ahead .
" the political elite think they 're from the noble class and they looked down on him as a self- made man from a poor farming background , " said mr yu .
there is an element of class conflict in the current struggle .
it is also about generational change and the transition to a more liberal democratic culture .
mr roh came to office with support from young voters , who favour closer ties with north korea and are suspicious of the long standing alliance with the united states .
candelit protest the fury and frustration in parliament found its echo on the streets .
what happens next ?
president roh 's powers suspended case decided by constitutional court , could take six months pm goh kun becomes acting head of state 15 april national assembly elections to go ahead click to watch the scuffle in parliament within hours of the vote thousands gathered for a candle lit vigil to support the president .
opinion polls suggest at least 70 % of the population oppose impeachment .
many say the main grounds for impeachment - illegal campaigning - are simply too trivial .
president roh in february had called for support for his own parliamentary faction in upcoming elections and received a mild censure for the national election commission .
" i thought a coup was carried out by tanks and guns , but this was a coup disguised as a legal process , " said one of the demonstrators outside the national assembly .
mr roh remains hunkered down in the presidential mansion , the blue house , but he 's been stripped of his powers and must wait the verdict of the constitutional court which has six months to make its decision .
prime minister goh kun , who has taken over as acting president , said he hoped it would decide as soon as possible .
he has called for calm and is trying to assert his authority over the machinery of government .
but south korea has been left with a political vacuum that could have damaging consequences for the economy and national security - at a time when north korea is resisting international demands to abandon its development of nuclear weapons .
yet for all the sound and fury it is a measure of south korea 's democratic progress that no-one is talking about the danger of an uprising or a military coup .
on two previous occasions when south korea has been without a strong president , the military took over .
those days are long over .
but many koreans are concerned about the continuing immaturity of the political process and what are seen as the wildly irresponsible antics of politicians .
the opposition parties appear to have decided on impeachment as a last resort in the run up to hotly contested national assembly elections on 15 april .
they are up to their necks in a massive political finding scandal and have been losing support to the reformist mps who back president roh .
sympathy vote mr roh 's aides and relatives were also found to have taken millions in illegal contributions .
that severely weakened his position .
but many voters still see the president as cleaner than his opponents .
mr roh has shown extraordinary resilience in the past .
he defied all the odds to emerge as his party 's presidential candidate and then to win the 2002 election by a whisker .
it would be a mistake to count him out now .
he will be hoping for exoneration by the constitutional court .
meanwhile his supporters could emerge as the majority party in the upcoming legislative election , buoyed by a sympathy vote .
the gloves have come off in south korea 's bitter political feud and the contestants are preparing themselves for the second round .

the uk government has agreed in principle to the commercial growing of one variety of genetically modified maize .
the decision follows five years of tests and consultation .
the first gm maize crop is unlikely to be planted before 2005 because of related legal challenges and unanswered scientific questions .
what do you think about the government 's decision to allow commercial gm maize ?
do you read labels to check for gm ?
send us your thoughts .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by william w , uk why are gm crops to be given the go-ahead despite massive public opposition and a lack of scientific investigation ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think that we should look very closely at the interests of the most vocal anti-gm lobby .
just as certain scientists and politicians can be suspected of being too close to the industries that control gm commercialisation , it is possible that some these people have their own not-so-noble reasons for wanting to block gm technology .
the scientific results for the gm maize are as plain as day - it is less harmful to biodiversity than conventially grown crops .
why ca n't the anti-gmers see past their prejudice ?
gordon mcdougall , dundee , scotland i have stayed away from politics most of my life but now this issue of gm crops is making me mad .
labour has lost all sense of what is right .
next election i will make a point to vote them out and will encourage everyone i know to do the same .
it is time to rise up and take control of our country .
how does the government not understand the people do not want gm ?
anthony morton , winchester like hey , did we expect any other decision from a government that consistently ignores public opinion .
but i am looking forward to the next election ... this time i wo n't be so stupid !
russell chamberlain , telford , england i think they are very misguided .
unlike the majority of the public , i have a pretty good understanding of how these foods are created and the pitfalls of such unnatural genetic modification and the horrible viruses they use to bring it about .
i have received information about adverse effects of gm crops , suppressed negative research , etc .
i think that the whole set-up stinks .
a. m. wilson , oxford , uk there is more than enough food to feed the world john , wales widespread gm contamination has already occurred in north america , would be inevitable here , unnecessarily risking the health of the nation .
there is more than enough food to feed the world .
john , wales yes , of course it 's right .
we must not allow ourselves to be bullied and misinformed by single-issue anti-gm activists .
gm technology is both safe and useful , and should be welcomed .
this is the 21st century , after all .
nick , london i seem to remember that we were lied to by the government about animal feed resulting in cattle getting bse and humans cjd .
how more dangerous is this ?
barry cornell , wokingham , england a small step , but a significant one .
i hope that this opens the way for further gm crops to be grown in the uk so that we all may benefit from the environmental advantages .
nick todd , folkestone , uk it 's curious to see how many people say that we should shut up and listen to the scientists .
would those be the same scientists who said thalidomide was safe ?
if gm food is virtually the same as non-gm there are two clear questions - firstly who will take liability in the event of a mistake , and secondly will these foodstuffs be clearly labelled so those who prefer not to eat them can avoid them ?
john b , uk why is it that , just because we have technology to do things , we feel we have to ? ?
nature provides us with the best food possible and if we work with her we reap all the rewards of a rich countryside .
how many times have we been told things are safe only to be told at a later date that the scientists / government are wrong ?
the government should listen to its people .
sue gordon , derby , england the issue has been biased in favour of the bio-tech companies .
they are suggesting that gm should be allowed because there is no proof that there is risk .
however the same burden of proof is not being applied to them in that they can not prove that it is safe .
in fact they refuse to stand over their products by accepting liability .
peter hawkins , belfast why does the uk government persist in foisting this problem onto us ?
jl , wiltshire i am a manager of a major supermarket and i receive more queries about gm products than any other query .
everyone wants to be assured that we will not stock any gm food .
why does the uk government persist in foisting this problem onto us ?
jl , wiltshire when do we get a democracy in this country ?
when will politicians learn they are there to do what we want ?
whether it is gm crops or iraq this country 's views should reflect those of us , the people .
andrew milne , largs , ayrshire this new gm maize crop will be used to feed livestock - and we will have no way of knowing whether the milk that we drink or the meat that we eat has come from a gm-fed animal .
it sounds to me that this government really does n't care about consumer choice , or our right to know what goes into what we eat .
mark wilkinson , london , uk the number of people that swallowed the gm industry line that it will help mankind is rather worrying .
monsanto etc are n't investing millions in research to help third world peoples , they 're doing it for their own profits , which will be guaranteed when they 've infested the globe .
and as for those claiming that gm has been going on for thousands of years , well , that is patently rubbish .
no bronze age farmer inserted fish genes into tomatoes , they just crossbred very similar and closely related species .
greg brown , norwich , uk i do not recall any manifesto statement allowing a mandate to destroy organic farming -lrb- which it will -rrb- increasing chemical pollution -lrb- which it will -rrb- and permission to arrogantly ignore the clear voice of the people .
no no no , when will blair understand no ?
if we can not trust a government on food and health we can trust them on nothing .
richard , oxford yes it 's right .
i can not believe that there are so many damn luddites in the uk .
the british empire was built on scientific revolution .
the current crumbling state of the uk is in no small way down to the re-emergence of king ludd and his blinkered followers .
wake up people and take a chance on life .
mike daws , oslo , norway as many people seem to be saying , the voters should chose .
but those that vote against gm crops are not benefiting anyone .
people should listen and not doubt what the scientists say .
they have done more than five years testing on these crops and have published the findings which no one can doubt .
people do n't realise that with current food production , people in britain will starve and die .
and yet people pay more for food of " better quality " .
dave , stamford , uk i think that the government and most scientists have my welfare at heart g.g.heathcote , england i am probably the same as 99 % of people in this country in that i do n't know whether the gm crop decision is the right one .
i , therefore , have to rely on expert opinion to help me .
i think that the government and most scientists have my welfare at heart and are not trying to poison me and am prepared to go along with their decision .
the alternative is to listen to ill-informed do-gooders who know no more than i do but have some political agenda to follow .
g.g.heathcote , england whatever the scientific case , i can not see any economic justification for gm technology in food production .
already europe produces much more food than required , with the result that the excess is dumped in the third world .
the consequence of this is that a sustainable and independent agricultural economy does not develop in these countries .
gm technology in food production is solely for the benefit of the companies themselves .
nigel , lee on solent , uk most people are only getting very biased opinions from all the scaremongering stories the newspapers have decided to print .
unless unbiased information is reported then people will continue to be against anything like this as the man on the street wo n't bother digging to try and get hidden information .
do people know how they 're gm ?
as a general rule people are afraid of change .
personally , i have no problem accepting gm crops .
mags , oxford , uk as a biologist i believe that it is not possible to argue , on scientific grounds at least , that all gm crops are intrinsically risky .
however , i have seen nothing to suggest that their introduction will be of any benefit whatsoever to society - their introduction merely serves to strengthen the corporate monopolies that have lobbied for their introduction .
surely governments should make policy based on the best interests of the public that they represent .
c o 'byrne , galway , ireland the majority of their so called benefits would be better met with clever environmental farm management hugh knowles , london i am aware of most of the arguments against gm crops but so far i have not heard a reasonable argument as to why they should be grown here .
we do not need them and the majority of their so called benefits would be better met with clever environmental farm management .
there is only one reason for the government and that is the influence of big business .
hugh knowles , london let 's not forget there are millions of acres of gm crops planted across north america , and have been for many years .
there 's clearly no associated health risk there .
this whole ' debate ' is just a storm in a teacup whipped up by so-called environmental groups looking to fill their subscription coffers .
john , this website 's own poll indicates 80 % of people being against gm maize .
yet our democratically elected government chooses to ignore the will of the majority .
frankly it does n't matter to new labour what we think - until about six months before a general election .
chris hollett , uk using gm will start the process seen with antibiotics where nature responds , then we respond back and so on until normal crops ca n't survive without a little gm .
no hard evidence to think this but it seems to happen whenever you challenge nature .
antibiotics were worth it , is gm ?
barry carter , chelmsford , england there is no economic , social or biological need for these crops pete , london , uk i 'm a scientist who was initially excited about the potential of gm - however the results of the field trials , and concerns raised about the safety of gm have changed my opinion .
there is no economic , social or biological need for these crops - the only ones who will benefit from them are the biotech companies .
pete , london , uk gm crops are produced by an advanced form of cross-pollination .
no-one should worry about ' contamination ' of organic crops .
people who purchase organic food can remain safe in the knowledge that only pesticides from an approved ' organic ' list are used in cultivation , and they can remain as ignorant as before of the breeding practices used to produce disease and pest-resistant strains of plants for organic growth .
they should really be arguing for using gm technology for this purpose if they want to promote the organic cause .
susan , york , england are gm crops safe ?
are inventions safe ?
let 's stop generalising .
each modified species is an individual experiment .
each one needs to be identified and tested before being released into the environment .
graham , high wycombe , bucks do we in europe actually need this , are n't there warehouses filled with rotting grain that needs to be eaten rather than more crop unnecessarily grown - gm or not - only to be wasted .
david hilton , hudds , uk after bothering to hold a public consultation exercise the government should listen to the opinion expressed john , uk after bothering to hold a public consultation exercise the government should listen to the opinion expressed , i.e. not to permit gm crops to be grown .
if such consultation is an attempt to broaden democracy it can not be ignored just because it did n't give the answer government wanted .
ultimately they 'll get a similar answer when it comes to a general election !
john , uk there is a simple way to deal with this - insist your supermarket , corner shop , cafe , take away and favourite restaurant serve and sell only gm food - demand gm food to be labelled - no one will willingly buy gm food so be vigilant about processed food too - with no demand for gm food there will be no gm crops by simple operation of the market tom , london if there is insufficient evidence to make an informed decision on the risks posed by gm crops , are n't the luddites who 've been trampling / uprooting field trials at every opportunity significantly to blame for this ?
david , milton keynes , uk the idea that the public do n't understand the arguments and so should n't be able to prevent the introduction of gm is dangerous nonsense .
the onus is upon the scientists to make the case .
if the public still say no then the answer is no .
i say this as a geneticist and a worker with recombinant dna .
the idea that a subsection of the population knows best and should make critical decisions regarding the shared environment is unacceptable .
phil , sheffield gm crops have been eaten in the uk for years kate donachie , edinburgh , scotland gm crops have been eaten in the uk for years .
most of our produce is grown using pesticides and if it was n't there would not be enough arable land to grow it .
if the world had taken this approach we would never had made any progress .
as the world 's population grows there will be a need to find ways of growing food more productively .
it is all very well sitting back now as we are alright , surely we should have some conscience for future generations .
kate donachie , edinburgh , scotland britain should have looked very carefully at the canadian gm experience .
it has been found that gm wheat seed has spread everywhere and pure seed , in bulk , is now impossible to find free from this contamination .
noel fowles , saltspring , bc , canada the potential damage to the environment and human health is still unknown , and could very possibly be devastating .
the only reason for going forward on this is purely economic , and therefore irresponsible on the part of those who are meant to protect the welfare of society .
this is a most distressing turn of events .
the people 's voice should be heard on this issue , but , as in the us , government and big business prevail. dniemann , new york , usa i 'm against all gm crops until further research is carried out .
the government has yet again gone against public opinion .
hopefully this will be reflected at the next election !
mike , london gm crops have the potential to feed the starving fletcher , poole , uk gm crops have the potential to feed the starving .
we can not allow fear and ignorance to stop this from happening .
the public in general will probably never be able to understand the scientific complexities of this subject - but the scientists must study until all the impacts are known .
only then should it be commercially produced .
fletcher , poole , uk the time has come for non-violent direct action to stop gm .
the country has clearly said a very loud no to gm , the scientists have said no , even economists have said no , and insurers have said they wont be ensuring anyone who goes ahead with gm against damage .
and when everything goes wrong a few years down the line , it 'll be tax payers that foot the bill .
you can stop irreversible genetic pollution , sign the green gloves pledge today - www.greengloves.org joss garman , uk i am not hugely knowledgeable about the gm debate but when the best the opponents can do is bring out the old line about not knowing the long term effects i think were probably safe .
long term effects in most environmental campaigners minds are testing things for 25 years effectively blocking any innovation no matter how safe .
dominic smith , reading , berks i do n't think there has ever been an issue with such a high majority of the public against it anonymous why is it that everything this government does is done in such a hurry ?
surely they must now have the record for badly thought through legislation that could have been useful if it had been properly prepared and researched .
i do n't think there has ever been an issue with such a high majority of the public against it as gm .
there is so much evidence from other countries of contamination and problems and unexpected effects .
why not do the trials without the atrazine , or is this like the war - being done because george bush says so ?
i understand this maize will be for animal food but i would n't want to eat meat that had been fed this maize .
anonymous it is alarming that companies have refused to accept any responsibility if things go wrong with gm crops .
this suggests two things to me : firstly , they are not very confident that there will be no problems ; secondly , the scale of any problems will be huge and hence extremely expensive for whoever has to clear them up , if indeed this is even possible .
until such time as companies are prepared to guarantee that they will put right any negative impact , gm crops should not be planted .
sue , barcelona , spain as with other important issues this government is ignoring the immense public objection to gm crops and going ahead with a potentially harmful and very little researched proposal .
if we choose to mutate our food and we are what we eat , what will that make us ?
m bennett , london , uk i like the way that the anti gm people like to portray the companies producing gm seeds as " big business " motivated purely by profit .
presumably all those supermarkets selling overpriced organic food are n't big businesses motivated by profit and are charging double the price of ordinary food out of some philanthropic instinct ?
peter , nottingham , uk why has the government not learned from the mistakes that led to the bse outbreak ?
jenny hubbard young , atlanta ga why has the government not learned from the mistakes that led to the bse outbreak ?
too busy salivating at the prospect of large donations from monsanto et al ?
i hope the welsh assembly has the courage to keep saying no !
jenny hubbard young , atlanta ga -lrb- and brecon -rrb- doom merchants and nay sayers have tried to put a stop to all scientific advances .
if we had listened to them we would still living in caves .
andy ross , uk cross contamination will inevitably result in the pollution of all we grow , eventually and judging from the state of our railways after privatisation , it would be sheer folly to entrust the genetic modification of our food to corporate global business .
amy womack , london if farm biodiversity is so important , why were the gm crops measured against the worst practice agriculture has to offer instead of the best , namely organic farms ?
if the gm wonder crops are really that good , then surely they should be measured against the best !
robert dunn , lancaster , uk it does not matter how much opposition to the gm crops there is in the uk , it is not a decision that our government can make as they have to allow the planting of any crop approved at eu level .
it 's just another example of how our politicians have handed control of the government of the united kingdom to brussels .
brian willis , slough , uk no .
there is absolutely no justification for going ahead with growing gm crops .
the only voices we hear in favour of gm foods are those of the lobbyists and ' sponsored ' scientific researchers .
david brower , glasgow rather than insulting us , answer our concerns !
cw , penrith , uk i 'm an environmentalist ; i also have a science degree , as many environmentalists do .
we are not luddite idiots , and i 'm fed up with being branded as such .
rather than insulting us , answer our concerns !
my objection is not so much that gm is bad for the environment , but that it has unknown and possibly catastrophic effects on human health , is uncontrollable , irreversible , is incompatible with other non-gm types of agriculture , and is completely unnecessary considering the current food excess , and lack of evidence of consistent higher gm crop yields .
none of these issues have been addressed by the uk field trials , and so-called science .
i also find it disgusting that the government wastes so much money asking a committee to investigate the issue , and canvassing public opinion only to ignore it yet again .
cw , penrith , uk this cynical action proves to the nation beyond any doubt that the government 's so-called consultation processes are a total sham .
quite clearly , their desire to satisfy the profit lust of the biotech companies is so strong that they are content even to ignore their own advisors .
hardly government on behalf of the greater good is it ?
keith calder , richmond , uk gm crops have got the go ahead for two reasons .
firstly , public opinion is wrong and the government is not going to be persuaded on an issue on the basis of the opinion of large numbers of uninformed people .
the second reason is that this technology is already 20 + years old and well proven .
only people who are ignorant of scientific methodology claim a lack of scientific evidence .
unfortunately , few people seem to have any ability to question their own judgement on a rational basis .
m home , aberystwyth , uk why did the government bother with the farce of public consultation ?
someone 's pockets must be getting well lined for gm crops to be approved in the face of such huge public opposition .
shame on you labour - in the pocket of the global nationals once again !
justin , brighton , uk how come the public have such strong opinions on this subject ?
i doubt 99 % even know how gm works let alone understand the implications well enough to have an informed opinion .
gavin , oxford this decision is an astounding success for corporate greed jim kenney , herts , uk this decision is an astounding success for corporate greed over democracy and common sense .
did the politicians learn nothing from bse ?
jim kenney , herts , uk the public voted an overwhelming ' no ' to gm because they knew that there were so many vested interests that getting to the truth was impossible , and the potential risks are very great .
the government ignored them and so declared itself also to have a vested interest .
the sooner we have a government that listens and does n't always think it knows best the better , but you wo n't ever get that while blair / brown are anywhere near power .
r scott-watson , fairfield , uk of course it is the wrong decision , which flies in the face of the whole consultation exercise that the government undertook at huge public expense .
can someone explain why they wasted all that time and money if they intended to ignore the outcome ?
graham shelton , oxford , england great news for consumers and farmers becci , loughborough , england it 's about time gm maize was allowed to be grown commercially .
it will produce more food at a cheaper cost , great news for consumers and farmers .
i am personally not worried at all about possible health risks of gm foods .
they 've been tested for years , and i trust the scientists and government enough to believe they would have done a thorough job of it all , making it safe for consumption .
becci , loughborough , england while not opposed to gm crops in principle , i query why the gm industry is not prepared to put its money where its mouth is by offering compensation to anyone who can prove they have been damaged by gm crops .
i certainly reject any suggestion that the rest of us should , via the public purse , underwrite these risks , rather than those who hope to profit from this technology .
peter north , sutton , uk i am very glad that the government has had the courage to make a decision based on facts and on the opinions of scientists , who have devoted their lives to understanding problems like this .
too often we are forced into following the views of those who are more bothered with scaremongering and sounding important than they are about truth and understanding .
mike , waterbeach , england yet again the government is being " irresponsible " , to quote the audit commission .
we do not need to grow more produce - the eu 's food mountain is big enough as it is !
jonathan , uk whatever the rights and wrongs of this issue , the uk does not need to grow gm crops .
therefore , while the slightest doubt remains about safety , why on earth should we take the risk ?
i also fear that this could signal the end of organic farming as i understand it .
how can it be possible to stop the bees etc from cross pollinating non gm crops ?
kay beresford , london , uk we do n't want and we do n't need gm crops .
their long-term effects on human health have not been tested .
jessica hodge , nailsworth , uk without informed debate , how can anyone decide ?
tom , burnley , uk the biggest problem with the gm " debate " is that the opposition is either ignorant and hysterical -lrb- ' gm crops ate my hamster ' -rrb- , or naive and bigoted .
without informed debate , how can anyone decide ?
the best thing is to go ahead and see what happens .
it is fatuous to claim that it will then be impossible to restore the status quo .
tom , burnley , uk seeds grown by the companies that specialise in making fertilisers and pesticides ?
sounds like a self-fulfilling cycle , does it not ?
this is for corporate profit ; not the good of the farmer , environment or consumer .
david , uk / usa this is an appalling decision .
i am very opposed to the idea of toying with nature , and think that this decision is very ill-thought out , and irreversible .
also , why bother with a massive and very expensive public consultation then take no notice of the overwhelming public opinion ?
chris , uk living as i do in a country in which it is now impossible to find a tomato that tastes like anything other than cardboard due to genetic manipulation , i sincerely hope that the uk government reconsiders its decision before it is too late .
genetically modified foods spread like a cancer , as we have seen with the destruction of the world 's corn crib in central america .
i am also at a loss to explain why consumers would bother even considering gm crops , taking into account the fact that most of them taste like -lrb- unappetising -rrb- tree bark .
i hope the uk populace has enough sense to not buy the gm maize , at the least .
bryan bailey , charlotte nc , usa i 'm opposed as all too often scientific zeal overlooks some small , but important factor .
there are too many things in nature which remain hidden for a generation at least .

stephen carlin , bangor , northern ireland the government surveys the people for their opinion regarding gm crops .
the people overwhelmingly say they do n't want gm crops .
the government plants gm crops .
roll on election time !
gerry noble , salisbury , uk gm means more pesticides , not less .
one of the main ' advantages ' of gm crops is that you can douse them with very strong pesticides , which they have been modified to be resistant to .
who wants to eat that ?
robert , london , uk we said no to this in the recent public consultation .
that means no .
neil , wrexham , uk we will be unable to go back and change clive wilkinson , henley-on-thames if allowed this will be without doubt the worst decision this government has made in its lifetime to date .
the potential damaging and far reaching consequences could be with us forever and we will be unable to go back and change them .
clive wilkinson , henley-on-thames , uk another decision made against the wishes of public opinion .
maybe the government has carried out field trails by eating a gm crop and has lost the ability to hear !
brian , sheffield , uk it seems that where the interests of big business are concerned , absolutely nothing is sacred to this government , not even our precious eco system .
chris , berkely , uk this decision will ruin the one great success story of british agriculture - organic farming .
experience in the us has shown that contamination of non gm crops by their gm neighbours has reached over 80 % .
gm producers and gm farmers must pay compensation when -lrb- not if -rrb- contamination occurs .
gill ward , lancashire , uk yet again the government completely ignores public opinion , as well as the recommendations of its own committees .
do we really live in a democracy ?
despite all the protestations of safety from the biotech companies , i think it 's very telling that they do n't want to be held financially accountable if things do go wrong in future .
kim richmond , aberdeen , uk we have been eating gm crops for centuries .
without modifying plants we would n't have the crops we know and eat today .
this is fear of new technology methods .
nothing is risk free , even the old methods of cross pollination did not come without risk .
i do not check labels for gm .
i am quite happy to eat gm .
people have been eating soya for years !
annette lamb , york , uk five years of extensive trials have found no detrimental affects on the environment steve , guildford , england good - common sense prevails at last !
five years of extensive trials have found no detrimental affects on the environment .
what the nay-sayers seem to forget is that gm means less pesticides and herbicides , which without doubt do harm the environment .
the only people who will be upset are the " soil association " and their supporters , who are worried about the consequences for their " organic " food rip off -lrb- pay twice the price for zero nutritional benefit ! -rrb- .
steve , guildford , england as a bee keeper i am worried about g.m crops .
i have no control over where my bees feed .
eric layer , sittingbourne i work for defra and i do n't recall anyone where i work being in favour of gm .
i think its a political decision made by the government and , like the iraq war , if they want to do something they will - regardless of what the voters want .
j hendrix , cheshire gm research to date has not been independent nor thorough enough .
over 90 % of it has been driven by the over-powerful commercial interests of a few large biotechnology companies .
in particular , whilst these same companies vehemently oppose accepting full liability for all unknown consequences that could possibly occur as a result of gm in the future , whether environmental -lrb- e.g. soil residues , gene transfer , superweeds , habitat destruction -rrb- or human health -lrb- e.g. immune reaction , allergies -rrb- the government is very wrong to accept this research and give the go ahead .
lh , uk no !
no !
no ! to gm !
colin hills , fleet , england the damage done to us farmer 's crops -lrb- organic / " normal farming " -rrb- through the planting of gm seed is enough proof that we should not go down that path .
people 's health is more important than corporate profits and the uk with the eu should refuse to accept the pressures of the us corporate interests .
there is no turning back once gm crops are planted so no !
no !
no ! to gm !
colin hills , fleet , england if , as supporters of gm technology say , there is no risk associated with it , why wo n't the biotechnology companies accept liability in the event of something going wrong ?
cw , penrith , uk britain is supposed to be a democratic system of government for the people by the people .
where are the vast majority of people asking for gm crops ?
big business is running the show , government is running scared and the people will be running the risk !
paul villa , wales , uk any decision to commercialize gm maize would be based on bad science , even though mrs beckett will say that she is forced by " the science " to agree to the listing of chardon ll .
the environmental audit committee has pointed to some of the bad science already - and there is plenty more , such as that published in nature last week .
there is great scientific uncertainty still - and any responsible government would have invoked the precautionary principle to maintain the " freeze " on the listing of gm crop varieties .
brian john , newport , pembs , uk i believe that there has n't been enough research into the possible long term effects of allowing commercial growing of gm crops .
in the us and canada some crops are causing harm as weeds become weed killer resistant meaning stronger and stronger doses of weed killers are required .
also the in the uk trials gm crops were compared to crops from intensive farming to see if there was less environmental damage , what about against organic agriculture ?
pete , amsterdam , the netherlands the motive for using gm crops is purely one of profit andrew thomas , swansea the motive for using gm crops is purely one of profit .
once again , the farmers are purely interested in cutting costs like they did when feeding cows to cows -lrb- which started the bse outbreak -rrb- or avoiding vaccination -lrb- which started the foot and mouth outbreak -rrb- .
it 's the same old story .
andrew thomas , swansea i fully support the government decision to grow gm crops .
with the advent of global warming we may find ourselves in the position where we ca n't grow enough food to feed all the people on the planet .
gm crops may increase the size of our crops and there ability to adapt to the changing climate .
we should also remember that people opposed the start of the industrial revolution as they did not understand what was happening .
david day , hamilton , scotland this situation is ridiculous .
we have so called environmentalists who clearly do not have the experience or knowledge to understand the science involved arguing against the scientists who do and against a technology that if used correctly would potentially benefit the environment .
dr. pam malarry , cambridge , uk i think any utilization of existing technologies to increase crop yields is a good thing as long as it is deemed safe .
like it or not , food is not an infinite resource and gm crops maximize the resources that we do have .
scott handel , arlington , va usa you can not contain genetically modified strains from the standard variety .
phillip holley , cambridgeshire , uk the question is not one of scale .
the issues with genetic modification is whether or not it happens at all .
you can not contain pollination by either wind or insect so you can not contain genetically modified strains from the standard variety .
it 's is this concern that creates so much objection .
i firmly believe that 's it 's a development that we can all happily do without .
phillip holley , cambridgeshire , uk i do n't know what the fuss is all about .
it is already too late - it is already in the environment !
tom salmon , swindon , wilts it 's the only sensible decision .
those who are anti-gm would no doubt have tried to ban mankind 's taming of fire on the grounds that it could possibly be dangerous .
some of them probably would n't even have come down from the trees in the first place because they thought walking on the ground was going to be too risky !
i want the opportunity to buy gm foods and reap the benefits they offer humankind for the future .
david moran , scotland / australia the biggest problem with gm is not the technology itself , but the application of the technology .
this move will result in large multi-nationals being able to patent and therefore ' own ' strains of crops , engineer them so that they do not naturally propagate -lrb- so farmers have to buy new seeds each season -rrb- and produce crops that are dependent on additives -lrb- supplied by the same multi-national , of course -rrb- .
anyone who thinks that this will help solve world poverty is living in cloud cuckoo land .
dave , swansea , wales the world 's population is increasing .
the amount of arable farm space is not - in fact it is decreasing .
to support a growing population we need to get more produce from a decreasing amount of farm space .
if famine is unacceptable then we have to choose stronger pesticides / fungicides or we could try using disease resistant gm crops .
the organic alternative is only suitable for the rich -lrb- i can tell that this is true every time i browse supermarket " organic " sections -rrb- .
gm crops will allow us to buy pesticide free produce at a reasonable price .
the battle is already over .
john bucknall , derby , uk it is a cautious and balanced approach mark g , evesham , uk i support the planting of gm maize in this country - i also support the fact that several other strains were shown in the trials to be unsuitable for widespread use just yet .
it is a cautious and balanced approach and only the extremists , who nothing will satisfy , on either side of the argument that are still moaning .
mark g , evesham , uk as far as i am concerned they can plant as much gm crops as they .
all that i want is to have the freedom to choose whether i , and my children , eat them or not - and that means proper controls on cross-pollination and effective labelling .
if these two things ca n't be guaranteed then planting should not be allowed .
phil britton , whitley bay , uk the government continues to incur massive opposition to gm crops but foolishly continues to push ahead with its gm folly in the hope that the uk public will change its mind and accept gm .
but why should we take risks with gm crops when perfectly natural varieties already exist in abundance ?

the uk government has agreed in principle to the commercial growing of one variety of genetically modified maize .
the decision follows five years of tests and consultation .
the first gm maize crop is unlikely to be planted before 2005 because of related legal challenges and unanswered scientific questions .
what do you think about the government 's decision to allow commercial gm maize ?
do you read labels to check for gm ?
send us your thoughts .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by william w , uk why are gm crops to be given the go-ahead despite massive public opposition and a lack of scientific investigation ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think that we should look very closely at the interests of the most vocal anti-gm lobby .
just as certain scientists and politicians can be suspected of being too close to the industries that control gm commercialisation , it is possible that some these people have their own not-so-noble reasons for wanting to block gm technology .
the scientific results for the gm maize are as plain as day - it is less harmful to biodiversity than conventially grown crops .
why ca n't the anti-gmers see past their prejudice ?
gordon mcdougall , dundee , scotland i have stayed away from politics most of my life but now this issue of gm crops is making me mad .
labour has lost all sense of what is right .
next election i will make a point to vote them out and will encourage everyone i know to do the same .
it is time to rise up and take control of our country .
how does the government not understand the people do not want gm ?
anthony morton , winchester like hey , did we expect any other decision from a government that consistently ignores public opinion .
but i am looking forward to the next election ... this time i wo n't be so stupid !
russell chamberlain , telford , england i think they are very misguided .
unlike the majority of the public , i have a pretty good understanding of how these foods are created and the pitfalls of such unnatural genetic modification and the horrible viruses they use to bring it about .
i have received information about adverse effects of gm crops , suppressed negative research , etc .
i think that the whole set-up stinks .
a. m. wilson , oxford , uk there is more than enough food to feed the world john , wales widespread gm contamination has already occurred in north america , would be inevitable here , unnecessarily risking the health of the nation .
there is more than enough food to feed the world .
john , wales yes , of course it 's right .
we must not allow ourselves to be bullied and misinformed by single-issue anti-gm activists .
gm technology is both safe and useful , and should be welcomed .
this is the 21st century , after all .
nick , london i seem to remember that we were lied to by the government about animal feed resulting in cattle getting bse and humans cjd .
how more dangerous is this ?
barry cornell , wokingham , england a small step , but a significant one .
i hope that this opens the way for further gm crops to be grown in the uk so that we all may benefit from the environmental advantages .
nick todd , folkestone , uk it 's curious to see how many people say that we should shut up and listen to the scientists .
would those be the same scientists who said thalidomide was safe ?
if gm food is virtually the same as non-gm there are two clear questions - firstly who will take liability in the event of a mistake , and secondly will these foodstuffs be clearly labelled so those who prefer not to eat them can avoid them ?
john b , uk why is it that , just because we have technology to do things , we feel we have to ? ?
nature provides us with the best food possible and if we work with her we reap all the rewards of a rich countryside .
how many times have we been told things are safe only to be told at a later date that the scientists / government are wrong ?
the government should listen to its people .
sue gordon , derby , england the issue has been biased in favour of the bio-tech companies .
they are suggesting that gm should be allowed because there is no proof that there is risk .
however the same burden of proof is not being applied to them in that they can not prove that it is safe .
in fact they refuse to stand over their products by accepting liability .
peter hawkins , belfast why does the uk government persist in foisting this problem onto us ?
jl , wiltshire i am a manager of a major supermarket and i receive more queries about gm products than any other query .
everyone wants to be assured that we will not stock any gm food .
why does the uk government persist in foisting this problem onto us ?
jl , wiltshire when do we get a democracy in this country ?
when will politicians learn they are there to do what we want ?
whether it is gm crops or iraq this country 's views should reflect those of us , the people .
andrew milne , largs , ayrshire this new gm maize crop will be used to feed livestock - and we will have no way of knowing whether the milk that we drink or the meat that we eat has come from a gm-fed animal .
it sounds to me that this government really does n't care about consumer choice , or our right to know what goes into what we eat .
mark wilkinson , london , uk the number of people that swallowed the gm industry line that it will help mankind is rather worrying .
monsanto etc are n't investing millions in research to help third world peoples , they 're doing it for their own profits , which will be guaranteed when they 've infested the globe .
and as for those claiming that gm has been going on for thousands of years , well , that is patently rubbish .
no bronze age farmer inserted fish genes into tomatoes , they just crossbred very similar and closely related species .
greg brown , norwich , uk i do not recall any manifesto statement allowing a mandate to destroy organic farming -lrb- which it will -rrb- increasing chemical pollution -lrb- which it will -rrb- and permission to arrogantly ignore the clear voice of the people .
no no no , when will blair understand no ?
if we can not trust a government on food and health we can trust them on nothing .
richard , oxford yes it 's right .
i can not believe that there are so many damn luddites in the uk .
the british empire was built on scientific revolution .
the current crumbling state of the uk is in no small way down to the re-emergence of king ludd and his blinkered followers .
wake up people and take a chance on life .
mike daws , oslo , norway as many people seem to be saying , the voters should chose .
but those that vote against gm crops are not benefiting anyone .
people should listen and not doubt what the scientists say .
they have done more than five years testing on these crops and have published the findings which no one can doubt .
people do n't realise that with current food production , people in britain will starve and die .
and yet people pay more for food of " better quality " .
dave , stamford , uk i think that the government and most scientists have my welfare at heart g.g.heathcote , england i am probably the same as 99 % of people in this country in that i do n't know whether the gm crop decision is the right one .
i , therefore , have to rely on expert opinion to help me .
i think that the government and most scientists have my welfare at heart and are not trying to poison me and am prepared to go along with their decision .
the alternative is to listen to ill-informed do-gooders who know no more than i do but have some political agenda to follow .
g.g.heathcote , england whatever the scientific case , i can not see any economic justification for gm technology in food production .
already europe produces much more food than required , with the result that the excess is dumped in the third world .
the consequence of this is that a sustainable and independent agricultural economy does not develop in these countries .
gm technology in food production is solely for the benefit of the companies themselves .
nigel , lee on solent , uk most people are only getting very biased opinions from all the scaremongering stories the newspapers have decided to print .
unless unbiased information is reported then people will continue to be against anything like this as the man on the street wo n't bother digging to try and get hidden information .
do people know how they 're gm ?
as a general rule people are afraid of change .
personally , i have no problem accepting gm crops .
mags , oxford , uk as a biologist i believe that it is not possible to argue , on scientific grounds at least , that all gm crops are intrinsically risky .
however , i have seen nothing to suggest that their introduction will be of any benefit whatsoever to society - their introduction merely serves to strengthen the corporate monopolies that have lobbied for their introduction .
surely governments should make policy based on the best interests of the public that they represent .
c o 'byrne , galway , ireland the majority of their so called benefits would be better met with clever environmental farm management hugh knowles , london i am aware of most of the arguments against gm crops but so far i have not heard a reasonable argument as to why they should be grown here .
we do not need them and the majority of their so called benefits would be better met with clever environmental farm management .
there is only one reason for the government and that is the influence of big business .
hugh knowles , london let 's not forget there are millions of acres of gm crops planted across north america , and have been for many years .
there 's clearly no associated health risk there .
this whole ' debate ' is just a storm in a teacup whipped up by so-called environmental groups looking to fill their subscription coffers .
john , this website 's own poll indicates 80 % of people being against gm maize .
yet our democratically elected government chooses to ignore the will of the majority .
frankly it does n't matter to new labour what we think - until about six months before a general election .
chris hollett , uk using gm will start the process seen with antibiotics where nature responds , then we respond back and so on until normal crops ca n't survive without a little gm .
no hard evidence to think this but it seems to happen whenever you challenge nature .
antibiotics were worth it , is gm ?
barry carter , chelmsford , england there is no economic , social or biological need for these crops pete , london , uk i 'm a scientist who was initially excited about the potential of gm - however the results of the field trials , and concerns raised about the safety of gm have changed my opinion .
there is no economic , social or biological need for these crops - the only ones who will benefit from them are the biotech companies .
pete , london , uk gm crops are produced by an advanced form of cross-pollination .
no-one should worry about ' contamination ' of organic crops .
people who purchase organic food can remain safe in the knowledge that only pesticides from an approved ' organic ' list are used in cultivation , and they can remain as ignorant as before of the breeding practices used to produce disease and pest-resistant strains of plants for organic growth .
they should really be arguing for using gm technology for this purpose if they want to promote the organic cause .
susan , york , england are gm crops safe ?
are inventions safe ?
let 's stop generalising .
each modified species is an individual experiment .
each one needs to be identified and tested before being released into the environment .
graham , high wycombe , bucks do we in europe actually need this , are n't there warehouses filled with rotting grain that needs to be eaten rather than more crop unnecessarily grown - gm or not - only to be wasted .
david hilton , hudds , uk after bothering to hold a public consultation exercise the government should listen to the opinion expressed john , uk after bothering to hold a public consultation exercise the government should listen to the opinion expressed , i.e. not to permit gm crops to be grown .
if such consultation is an attempt to broaden democracy it can not be ignored just because it did n't give the answer government wanted .
ultimately they 'll get a similar answer when it comes to a general election !
john , uk there is a simple way to deal with this - insist your supermarket , corner shop , cafe , take away and favourite restaurant serve and sell only gm food - demand gm food to be labelled - no one will willingly buy gm food so be vigilant about processed food too - with no demand for gm food there will be no gm crops by simple operation of the market tom , london if there is insufficient evidence to make an informed decision on the risks posed by gm crops , are n't the luddites who 've been trampling / uprooting field trials at every opportunity significantly to blame for this ?
david , milton keynes , uk the idea that the public do n't understand the arguments and so should n't be able to prevent the introduction of gm is dangerous nonsense .
the onus is upon the scientists to make the case .
if the public still say no then the answer is no .
i say this as a geneticist and a worker with recombinant dna .
the idea that a subsection of the population knows best and should make critical decisions regarding the shared environment is unacceptable .
phil , sheffield gm crops have been eaten in the uk for years kate donachie , edinburgh , scotland gm crops have been eaten in the uk for years .
most of our produce is grown using pesticides and if it was n't there would not be enough arable land to grow it .
if the world had taken this approach we would never had made any progress .
as the world 's population grows there will be a need to find ways of growing food more productively .
it is all very well sitting back now as we are alright , surely we should have some conscience for future generations .
kate donachie , edinburgh , scotland britain should have looked very carefully at the canadian gm experience .
it has been found that gm wheat seed has spread everywhere and pure seed , in bulk , is now impossible to find free from this contamination .
noel fowles , saltspring , bc , canada the potential damage to the environment and human health is still unknown , and could very possibly be devastating .
the only reason for going forward on this is purely economic , and therefore irresponsible on the part of those who are meant to protect the welfare of society .
this is a most distressing turn of events .
the people 's voice should be heard on this issue , but , as in the us , government and big business prevail. dniemann , new york , usa i 'm against all gm crops until further research is carried out .
the government has yet again gone against public opinion .
hopefully this will be reflected at the next election !
mike , london gm crops have the potential to feed the starving fletcher , poole , uk gm crops have the potential to feed the starving .
we can not allow fear and ignorance to stop this from happening .
the public in general will probably never be able to understand the scientific complexities of this subject - but the scientists must study until all the impacts are known .
only then should it be commercially produced .
fletcher , poole , uk the time has come for non-violent direct action to stop gm .
the country has clearly said a very loud no to gm , the scientists have said no , even economists have said no , and insurers have said they wont be ensuring anyone who goes ahead with gm against damage .
and when everything goes wrong a few years down the line , it 'll be tax payers that foot the bill .
you can stop irreversible genetic pollution , sign the green gloves pledge today - www.greengloves.org joss garman , uk i am not hugely knowledgeable about the gm debate but when the best the opponents can do is bring out the old line about not knowing the long term effects i think were probably safe .
long term effects in most environmental campaigners minds are testing things for 25 years effectively blocking any innovation no matter how safe .
dominic smith , reading , berks i do n't think there has ever been an issue with such a high majority of the public against it anonymous why is it that everything this government does is done in such a hurry ?
surely they must now have the record for badly thought through legislation that could have been useful if it had been properly prepared and researched .
i do n't think there has ever been an issue with such a high majority of the public against it as gm .
there is so much evidence from other countries of contamination and problems and unexpected effects .
why not do the trials without the atrazine , or is this like the war - being done because george bush says so ?
i understand this maize will be for animal food but i would n't want to eat meat that had been fed this maize .
anonymous it is alarming that companies have refused to accept any responsibility if things go wrong with gm crops .
this suggests two things to me : firstly , they are not very confident that there will be no problems ; secondly , the scale of any problems will be huge and hence extremely expensive for whoever has to clear them up , if indeed this is even possible .
until such time as companies are prepared to guarantee that they will put right any negative impact , gm crops should not be planted .
sue , barcelona , spain as with other important issues this government is ignoring the immense public objection to gm crops and going ahead with a potentially harmful and very little researched proposal .
if we choose to mutate our food and we are what we eat , what will that make us ?
m bennett , london , uk i like the way that the anti gm people like to portray the companies producing gm seeds as " big business " motivated purely by profit .
presumably all those supermarkets selling overpriced organic food are n't big businesses motivated by profit and are charging double the price of ordinary food out of some philanthropic instinct ?
peter , nottingham , uk why has the government not learned from the mistakes that led to the bse outbreak ?
jenny hubbard young , atlanta ga why has the government not learned from the mistakes that led to the bse outbreak ?
too busy salivating at the prospect of large donations from monsanto et al ?
i hope the welsh assembly has the courage to keep saying no !
jenny hubbard young , atlanta ga -lrb- and brecon -rrb- doom merchants and nay sayers have tried to put a stop to all scientific advances .
if we had listened to them we would still living in caves .
andy ross , uk cross contamination will inevitably result in the pollution of all we grow , eventually and judging from the state of our railways after privatisation , it would be sheer folly to entrust the genetic modification of our food to corporate global business .
amy womack , london if farm biodiversity is so important , why were the gm crops measured against the worst practice agriculture has to offer instead of the best , namely organic farms ?
if the gm wonder crops are really that good , then surely they should be measured against the best !
robert dunn , lancaster , uk it does not matter how much opposition to the gm crops there is in the uk , it is not a decision that our government can make as they have to allow the planting of any crop approved at eu level .
it 's just another example of how our politicians have handed control of the government of the united kingdom to brussels .
brian willis , slough , uk no .
there is absolutely no justification for going ahead with growing gm crops .
the only voices we hear in favour of gm foods are those of the lobbyists and ' sponsored ' scientific researchers .
david brower , glasgow rather than insulting us , answer our concerns !
cw , penrith , uk i 'm an environmentalist ; i also have a science degree , as many environmentalists do .
we are not luddite idiots , and i 'm fed up with being branded as such .
rather than insulting us , answer our concerns !
my objection is not so much that gm is bad for the environment , but that it has unknown and possibly catastrophic effects on human health , is uncontrollable , irreversible , is incompatible with other non-gm types of agriculture , and is completely unnecessary considering the current food excess , and lack of evidence of consistent higher gm crop yields .
none of these issues have been addressed by the uk field trials , and so-called science .
i also find it disgusting that the government wastes so much money asking a committee to investigate the issue , and canvassing public opinion only to ignore it yet again .
cw , penrith , uk this cynical action proves to the nation beyond any doubt that the government 's so-called consultation processes are a total sham .
quite clearly , their desire to satisfy the profit lust of the biotech companies is so strong that they are content even to ignore their own advisors .
hardly government on behalf of the greater good is it ?
keith calder , richmond , uk gm crops have got the go ahead for two reasons .
firstly , public opinion is wrong and the government is not going to be persuaded on an issue on the basis of the opinion of large numbers of uninformed people .
the second reason is that this technology is already 20 + years old and well proven .
only people who are ignorant of scientific methodology claim a lack of scientific evidence .
unfortunately , few people seem to have any ability to question their own judgement on a rational basis .
m home , aberystwyth , uk why did the government bother with the farce of public consultation ?
someone 's pockets must be getting well lined for gm crops to be approved in the face of such huge public opposition .
shame on you labour - in the pocket of the global nationals once again !
justin , brighton , uk how come the public have such strong opinions on this subject ?
i doubt 99 % even know how gm works let alone understand the implications well enough to have an informed opinion .
gavin , oxford this decision is an astounding success for corporate greed jim kenney , herts , uk this decision is an astounding success for corporate greed over democracy and common sense .
did the politicians learn nothing from bse ?
jim kenney , herts , uk the public voted an overwhelming ' no ' to gm because they knew that there were so many vested interests that getting to the truth was impossible , and the potential risks are very great .
the government ignored them and so declared itself also to have a vested interest .
the sooner we have a government that listens and does n't always think it knows best the better , but you wo n't ever get that while blair / brown are anywhere near power .
r scott-watson , fairfield , uk of course it is the wrong decision , which flies in the face of the whole consultation exercise that the government undertook at huge public expense .
can someone explain why they wasted all that time and money if they intended to ignore the outcome ?
graham shelton , oxford , england great news for consumers and farmers becci , loughborough , england it 's about time gm maize was allowed to be grown commercially .
it will produce more food at a cheaper cost , great news for consumers and farmers .
i am personally not worried at all about possible health risks of gm foods .
they 've been tested for years , and i trust the scientists and government enough to believe they would have done a thorough job of it all , making it safe for consumption .
becci , loughborough , england while not opposed to gm crops in principle , i query why the gm industry is not prepared to put its money where its mouth is by offering compensation to anyone who can prove they have been damaged by gm crops .
i certainly reject any suggestion that the rest of us should , via the public purse , underwrite these risks , rather than those who hope to profit from this technology .
peter north , sutton , uk i am very glad that the government has had the courage to make a decision based on facts and on the opinions of scientists , who have devoted their lives to understanding problems like this .
too often we are forced into following the views of those who are more bothered with scaremongering and sounding important than they are about truth and understanding .
mike , waterbeach , england yet again the government is being " irresponsible " , to quote the audit commission .
we do not need to grow more produce - the eu 's food mountain is big enough as it is !
jonathan , uk whatever the rights and wrongs of this issue , the uk does not need to grow gm crops .
therefore , while the slightest doubt remains about safety , why on earth should we take the risk ?
i also fear that this could signal the end of organic farming as i understand it .
how can it be possible to stop the bees etc from cross pollinating non gm crops ?
kay beresford , london , uk we do n't want and we do n't need gm crops .
their long-term effects on human health have not been tested .
jessica hodge , nailsworth , uk without informed debate , how can anyone decide ?
tom , burnley , uk the biggest problem with the gm " debate " is that the opposition is either ignorant and hysterical -lrb- ' gm crops ate my hamster ' -rrb- , or naive and bigoted .
without informed debate , how can anyone decide ?
the best thing is to go ahead and see what happens .
it is fatuous to claim that it will then be impossible to restore the status quo .
tom , burnley , uk seeds grown by the companies that specialise in making fertilisers and pesticides ?
sounds like a self-fulfilling cycle , does it not ?
this is for corporate profit ; not the good of the farmer , environment or consumer .
david , uk / usa this is an appalling decision .
i am very opposed to the idea of toying with nature , and think that this decision is very ill-thought out , and irreversible .
also , why bother with a massive and very expensive public consultation then take no notice of the overwhelming public opinion ?
chris , uk living as i do in a country in which it is now impossible to find a tomato that tastes like anything other than cardboard due to genetic manipulation , i sincerely hope that the uk government reconsiders its decision before it is too late .
genetically modified foods spread like a cancer , as we have seen with the destruction of the world 's corn crib in central america .
i am also at a loss to explain why consumers would bother even considering gm crops , taking into account the fact that most of them taste like -lrb- unappetising -rrb- tree bark .
i hope the uk populace has enough sense to not buy the gm maize , at the least .
bryan bailey , charlotte nc , usa i 'm opposed as all too often scientific zeal overlooks some small , but important factor .
there are too many things in nature which remain hidden for a generation at least .
five years is not enough , i.e. the public are to become guinea pigs .
it will be interesting to see how the rates of allergies change over the next 25 years .
stephen carlin , bangor , northern ireland the government surveys the people for their opinion regarding gm crops .
the people overwhelmingly say they do n't want gm crops .
the government plants gm crops .
roll on election time !
gerry noble , salisbury , uk gm means more pesticides , not less .
one of the main ' advantages ' of gm crops is that you can douse them with very strong pesticides , which they have been modified to be resistant to .
who wants to eat that ?
robert , london , uk we said no to this in the recent public consultation .
that means no .
neil , wrexham , uk we will be unable to go back and change clive wilkinson , henley-on-thames if allowed this will be without doubt the worst decision this government has made in its lifetime to date .
the potential damaging and far reaching consequences could be with us forever and we will be unable to go back and change them .
clive wilkinson , henley-on-thames , uk another decision made against the wishes of public opinion .
maybe the government has carried out field trails by eating a gm crop and has lost the ability to hear !
brian , sheffield , uk it seems that where the interests of big business are concerned , absolutely nothing is sacred to this government , not even our precious eco system .
chris , berkely , uk this decision will ruin the one great success story of british agriculture - organic farming .
experience in the us has shown that contamination of non gm crops by their gm neighbours has reached over 80 % .
gm producers and gm farmers must pay compensation when -lrb- not if -rrb- contamination occurs .
gill ward , lancashire , uk yet again the government completely ignores public opinion , as well as the recommendations of its own committees .
do we really live in a democracy ?
despite all the protestations of safety from the biotech companies , i think it 's very telling that they do n't want to be held financially accountable if things do go wrong in future .
kim richmond , aberdeen , uk we have been eating gm crops for centuries .
without modifying plants we would n't have the crops we know and eat today .
this is fear of new technology methods .
nothing is risk free , even the old methods of cross pollination did not come without risk .
i do not check labels for gm .
i am quite happy to eat gm .
people have been eating soya for years !
annette lamb , york , uk five years of extensive trials have found no detrimental affects on the environment steve , guildford , england good - common sense prevails at last !
five years of extensive trials have found no detrimental affects on the environment .
what the nay-sayers seem to forget is that gm means less pesticides and herbicides , which without doubt do harm the environment .
the only people who will be upset are the " soil association " and their supporters , who are worried about the consequences for their " organic " food rip off -lrb- pay twice the price for zero nutritional benefit ! -rrb- .
steve , guildford , england as a bee keeper i am worried about g.m crops .
i have no control over where my bees feed .
eric layer , sittingbourne i work for defra and i do n't recall anyone where i work being in favour of gm .
i think its a political decision made by the government and , like the iraq war , if they want to do something they will - regardless of what the voters want .
j hendrix , cheshire gm research to date has not been independent nor thorough enough .
over 90 % of it has been driven by the over-powerful commercial interests of a few large biotechnology companies .
in particular , whilst these same companies vehemently oppose accepting full liability for all unknown consequences that could possibly occur as a result of gm in the future , whether environmental -lrb- e.g. soil residues , gene transfer , superweeds , habitat destruction -rrb- or human health -lrb- e.g. immune reaction , allergies -rrb- the government is very wrong to accept this research and give the go ahead .
lh , uk no !
no !
no ! to gm !
colin hills , fleet , england the damage done to us farmer 's crops -lrb- organic / " normal farming " -rrb- through the planting of gm seed is enough proof that we should not go down that path .
people 's health is more important than corporate profits and the uk with the eu should refuse to accept the pressures of the us corporate interests .
there is no turning back once gm crops are planted so no !
no !
no ! to gm !
colin hills , fleet , england if , as supporters of gm technology say , there is no risk associated with it , why wo n't the biotechnology companies accept liability in the event of something going wrong ?
cw , penrith , uk britain is supposed to be a democratic system of government for the people by the people .
where are the vast majority of people asking for gm crops ?
big business is running the show , government is running scared and the people will be running the risk !
paul villa , wales , uk any decision to commercialize gm maize would be based on bad science , even though mrs beckett will say that she is forced by " the science " to agree to the listing of chardon ll .
the environmental audit committee has pointed to some of the bad science already - and there is plenty more , such as that published in nature last week .
there is great scientific uncertainty still - and any responsible government would have invoked the precautionary principle to maintain the " freeze " on the listing of gm crop varieties .
brian john , newport , pembs , uk i believe that there has n't been enough research into the possible long term effects of allowing commercial growing of gm crops .
in the us and canada some crops are causing harm as weeds become weed killer resistant meaning stronger and stronger doses of weed killers are required .
also the in the uk trials gm crops were compared to crops from intensive farming to see if there was less environmental

its central purpose was to finally draw a line under the iraq crisis and re-focus the eyes of both his party and the voters back onto the domestic agenda .
blair hopes to highlight the domestic agenda and , despite the horror of the madrid atrocity , the prime minister concentrated on doing just that .
he did devote the opening section of his address to warning people once again that they should not underestimate the threat posed by global terrorism , likening it to nazism and the cold war .
but he quickly moved on to the core of his address and it was hard not to see this as the speech which also fired the starting pistol on the next general election campaign .
his rallying call to his troops and his comprehensive assault on the tories have boosted speculation that that poll will indeed now come some time next summer .
it certainly had all the hallmarks of a pre-election speech .
it was peppered with talk of the prime minister 's vision , it attempted to remind people why they voted new labour in the first place seven years ago , and it promised a third term blair government would press ahead with radical reforms to put britain in the lead in the world .
party successes unlike some of his recent speeches on domestic issues , it was also more conciliatory towards his own party .
there was none of the old talk about wreckers or the forces of conservatism trying to destroy his programme of reform .
this speech was all about the successes he , the party and the government had already achieved .
it was all about " us " and " we " rather than the " me " and " you " which have often been the hallmarks of his previous speeches .
the prime minister also signalled a significant change of tack , away from reassurances that if people just held on a little longer they would soon start to feel the benefits of his massive investment programme .
this time it was all about how that delivery was well under way .
things really had got better .
individuals were already experiencing the benefits of better health and education provision - and there would be more to come , he said .
new tory threat what worries the government is the suggestion that , despite their personal experiences , voters still do not believe the improvements are widespread .
mr blair 's job is to persuade them that really is the case and that the tories would wreck it all by returning to the bad old days of thatcherism .
his attack on the opposition also had a new tone .
it implicitly acknowledged that the tory party under michael howard is a real electoral threat .
that can only do the prime minister good with his own troops and he is obviously eager to persuade his party and supporters that they now face a stark choice between new labour or a revitalised thatcherite tory party .
this was also a speech which betrayed no sign whatsoever that the prime minister may be preparing to stand down before the next general election .

the madrid bombings may have helped him to the extent that they appear to support his warnings about the threats posed by terrorism .
others , of course , will argue that his actions in iraq have made such attacks more , rather than less , likely .

lord penrose 's half million word report criticised both the company and the system of regulation operated by the government at the time .
but he made no recommendations about compensation for the million investors in equitable life who may have lost £ 3bn due to mismanagement at the company .
campaigners say lord penrose was prevented from considering compensation , a gap they now want filled .
but speaking on bbc radio 4 's money box programme , treasury minister ruth kelly denied lord penrose had been hampered in this way : " if you look at the letter he put out at the time of the publication of the report he said his brief was wide .
" he was free to interpret his brief in the manner he saw fit .
he chose to interpret his report to be a non-adversarial approach to examining the issues . "
acceptance and trust but that is not how campaigners see it .
paul braithwaite is chairman of the equitable members action group .
he wants penrose ii .
we would accept and trust his findings paul braithwaite , equitable members action group speaking to the programme , he said : " the remit of penrose cast in stone back in july 2002 precluded him from looking at compensation .
" go back to lord penrose who has now generated the trust of the policy-holders and say to him ' can you do the part of the job you were not asked to do first time around ? '
that is , to look at whether compensation is in your objective opinion appropriate .
we would accept and trust his findings . "
but ruth kelly claimed that lord penrose himself has ruled that out : " lord penrose has said he would need an adversarial statutory basis for examining those sorts of issues .
" he specifically says those are issues for the courts .
he also says it could not be done within a timescale , to quote from him , ' which has regard to the public interest . " '
issues for the courts ?
although ms kelly accepted that the regulators did not prevent the crisis , she said the blame lies elsewhere : " principally , it is the society that was at fault .
" yes , the regulatory system failed to pick it up .
but in no place did he suggest that the regulatory system failure was responsible for the economic loss of policy-holders .
we have to do what is right not just by equitable policy-holders but also by other tax-paying families up and down the country .
treasury minister ruth kelly " decisions were taken that were hidden from policy-holders , hidden from regulators , even hidden from its own board . "
and she was adamant that there are wider implications of paying out public money for private losses .
" we have to do what is right not just by equitable policy-holders but also by other tax-paying families up and down the country .
" it is a very important message for people to understand .

lord penrose 's half million word report criticised both the company and the system of regulation operated by the government at the time .
but he made no recommendations about compensation for the million investors in equitable life who may have lost £ 3bn due to mismanagement at the company .
campaigners say lord penrose was prevented from considering compensation , a gap they now want filled .
but speaking on bbc radio 4 's money box programme , treasury minister ruth kelly denied lord penrose had been hampered in this way : " if you look at the letter he put out at the time of the publication of the report he said his brief was wide .
" he was free to interpret his brief in the manner he saw fit .
he chose to interpret his report to be a non-adversarial approach to examining the issues . "
acceptance and trust but that is not how campaigners see it .
paul braithwaite is chairman of the equitable members action group .
he wants penrose ii .
we would accept and trust his findings paul braithwaite , equitable members action group speaking to the programme , he said : " the remit of penrose cast in stone back in july 2002 precluded him from looking at compensation .
" go back to lord penrose who has now generated the trust of the policy-holders and say to him ' can you do the part of the job you were not asked to do first time around ? '
that is , to look at whether compensation is in your objective opinion appropriate .
we would accept and trust his findings . "
but ruth kelly claimed that lord penrose himself has ruled that out : " lord penrose has said he would need an adversarial statutory basis for examining those sorts of issues .
" he specifically says those are issues for the courts .
he also says it could not be done within a timescale , to quote from him , ' which has regard to the public interest . " '
issues for the courts ?
although ms kelly accepted that the regulators did not prevent the crisis , she said the blame lies elsewhere : " principally , it is the society that was at fault .
" yes , the regulatory system failed to pick it up .
but in no place did he suggest that the regulatory system failure was responsible for the economic loss of policy-holders .
we have to do what is right not just by equitable policy-holders but also by other tax-paying families up and down the country .
treasury minister ruth kelly " decisions were taken that were hidden from policy-holders , hidden from regulators , even hidden from its own board . "
and she was adamant that there are wider implications of paying out public money for private losses .
" we have to do what is right not just by equitable policy-holders but also by other tax-paying families up and down the country .
" it is a very important message for people to understand .
we can not underwrite each and every business in the uk . "

however , the resolution stopped short of threatening un sanctions against tehran which the us had pressed for .
the deal comes after a week of intense negotiations by the 35-member board of governors of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
but iran described the resolution as a setback and implied that it had been imposed on the body by the us .
" a resolution is being imposed , and i think i am using the expression with true definition of the word , on the board by a single country , " senior foreign ministry official amir zamaninia told the meeting .
he added that the resolution had portrayed a " benign progressive situation " as a state of high alert .
but kenneth brill , the us envoy to the iaea , said the resolution made it clear that the board was not yet satisfied with iran 's co-operation .
' vacation issue ' the deal follows iran 's unexpected decision to postpone un inspections of its sites for the next month .
the inside of a gas centrifuge western diplomats said the move was disturbing , but tehran 's ambassador to the un in vienna , pirooz hosseini , said inspections would only be delayed three weeks because of iran 's new year celebrations which begin next week .
" this is just purely a vacation issue , " he told reuters news agency .
a diplomat close to iaea , says the postponement is expected to last much longer than the official four-day holiday and is clearly not the reason for tehran 's sudden decision .
the us accuses iran of systematically hiding evidence of nuclear weapons development .
iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only .
wording changed canada , australia and ireland presented the us-backed text for discussion , while malaysia spoke for the 13 non-aligned states on the iaea board .
non-aligned movement countries have been trying to soften the tone of the toughly-worded draft to avoid alienating tehran .
but diplomats said that while dropping most of their objections the countries had changed the wording of the resolution , in effect deferring the threat of action against iran until the board meets again in june .
iran 's ambassador had described the original draft as an act of us bullying .
mr hosseini later told afp news agency that iran would still co-operate with the iaea regardless of the resolution adopted .

life in downing street may indeed have seemed pretty rotten in recent months - ex-ministers and rebels picking on him ; the drip-drip criticism of the iraq war ; even the odd health scare .
the prime minister did not quite raise a monty pythonesque whistle to rally the grass roots at labour 's spring conference in manchester .
but to make delegates laugh and smile , though not sing , he had the kind of self-deprecating jokes guaranteed to go down well among the rank-and-file .
heart scare quip a broad grin sprang across his face as he said : " here 's three words you never thought you 'd hear me say .
vote for ken " - a reference to his u-turn in favour of london mayor ken livingstone .
there was a jibe about his famous inability to master computers .
and after a section about heart surgery , the man taken to hospital for an irregular heartbeat quipped ; " you can see what i 've been studying - what happens to heart patients .
that 's a joke incidentally guys . "
whenever i hear him speak it reminds me of where we are going in the great run of things tania rogers labour delegate then there were the lists of labour 's achievements , on the economy , on healthcare , on education .
the 39-minute speech , aimed at reconciliation with his party , did not contain a single mention of iraq but there were attacks and mockery against the tories .
leaning back and forward on the podium , this was mr blair as the enthuser , moving away from the kind of " no reverse gear emphasis " seen in recent conference outings .
' confidence ' instead , his message was that life might be a " perpetual struggle " , he said , again pressing the case for reform .
but britain was " winning " .
he accused the conservatives of trying to ferment national pessimism and his upbeat message was meant to send labour activists whistling their way from doorstep to doorstep ahead of this june 's local and european elections .
the buzzwords were all there : hope , opportunity , new , faith , pride and belief .
" believe your own experience , " pleaded mr blair .
" this is a time for confidence . "
inspiration it was an appeal which appeared to win a pretty united thumbs up from his audience , who after all had given up a weekend for their party .
the standing ovation of just over a minute from the 2,000 delegates was mirrored outside the hall .
lucy powell , a labour member from manchester , said : " it set out a vision for the country .
i will definitely go out with a spring in my step . "
tania rogers , a labour constituency party secretary from saffron walden , essex , called the speech inspiring .
" sometimes we forget the achievements we have made because people like you in the press sometimes ask about the things we have not yet done , " she said .
" whenever i hear him speak it reminds me of where we are going in the great run of things and to get on and do it . "
durham city councillor les sheppard said the speech had given him the right kind of vision to take to voters who often did not look too far into the future .
" it was straight to the point , " he said .
" he did not demean or lower himself to chastising certain individuals .
" it 's now up to people like us to put forward the aspirations of the government and particularly of the prime minister . "
unity ?
labour officials say this was the domestic focused speech mr blair has been wanting to make and dave lancaster , deputy leader of salford council said he had pointed the right direction .
" there was a message there to say that we have got to recognise that we have gone beyond the situation we had in the war and we have got to concentrate on what happens internally , including security . "
but mr blair 's attempts to rebuild bridges was not universally successful .
rachel garnham , a labour women 's officer in hackney north and stoke newington , london , said : " i was horrified that new labour is still going .
i thought they had dropped that whole thing . "
" he has got to change policy if he wants to rebuild bridges and i saw no sign of that .
" he flagged up university top-up fees as an example of the way we needed to go and said we have got to press ahead with reform in education and health .
" that 's not what they need , they need sustained investment . "
mr blair may have most of the delegates in manchester whistling to his tune but the question now is how far he can get ordinary voters humming along to what seems to be a " things can only get even better " theme .

life in downing street may indeed have seemed pretty rotten in recent months - ex-ministers and rebels picking on him ; the drip-drip criticism of the iraq war ; even the odd health scare .
the prime minister did not quite raise a monty pythonesque whistle to rally the grass roots at labour 's spring conference in manchester .
but to make delegates laugh and smile , though not sing , he had the kind of self-deprecating jokes guaranteed to go down well among the rank-and-file .
heart scare quip a broad grin sprang across his face as he said : " here 's three words you never thought you 'd hear me say .
vote for ken " - a reference to his u-turn in favour of london mayor ken livingstone .
there was a jibe about his famous inability to master computers .
and after a section about heart surgery , the man taken to hospital for an irregular heartbeat quipped ; " you can see what i 've been studying - what happens to heart patients .
that 's a joke incidentally guys . "
whenever i hear him speak it reminds me of where we are going in the great run of things tania rogers labour delegate then there were the lists of labour 's achievements , on the economy , on healthcare , on education .
the 39-minute speech , aimed at reconciliation with his party , did not contain a single mention of iraq but there were attacks and mockery against the tories .
leaning back and forward on the podium , this was mr blair as the enthuser , moving away from the kind of " no reverse gear emphasis " seen in recent conference outings .
' confidence ' instead , his message was that life might be a " perpetual struggle " , he said , again pressing the case for reform .
but britain was " winning " .
he accused the conservatives of trying to ferment national pessimism and his upbeat message was meant to send labour activists whistling their way from doorstep to doorstep ahead of this june 's local and european elections .
the buzzwords were all there : hope , opportunity , new , faith , pride and belief .
" believe your own experience , " pleaded mr blair .
" this is a time for confidence . "
inspiration it was an appeal which appeared to win a pretty united thumbs up from his audience , who after all had given up a weekend for their party .
the standing ovation of just over a minute from the 2,000 delegates was mirrored outside the hall .
lucy powell , a labour member from manchester , said : " it set out a vision for the country .
i will definitely go out with a spring in my step . "
tania rogers , a labour constituency party secretary from saffron walden , essex , called the speech inspiring .
" sometimes we forget the achievements we have made because people like you in the press sometimes ask about the things we have not yet done , " she said .
" whenever i hear him speak it reminds me of where we are going in the great run of things and to get on and do it . "
durham city councillor les sheppard said the speech had given him the right kind of vision to take to voters who often did not look too far into the future .
" it was straight to the point , " he said .
" he did not demean or lower himself to chastising certain individuals .
" it 's now up to people like us to put forward the aspirations of the government and particularly of the prime minister . "
unity ?
labour officials say this was the domestic focused speech mr blair has been wanting to make and dave lancaster , deputy leader of salford council said he had pointed the right direction .
" there was a message there to say that we have got to recognise that we have gone beyond the situation we had in the war and we have got to concentrate on what happens internally , including security . "
but mr blair 's attempts to rebuild bridges was not universally successful .
rachel garnham , a labour women 's officer in hackney north and stoke newington , london , said : " i was horrified that new labour is still going .
i thought they had dropped that whole thing . "
" he has got to change policy if he wants to rebuild bridges and i saw no sign of that .
" he flagged up university top-up fees as an example of the way we needed to go and said we have got to press ahead with reform in education and health .
" that 's not what they need , they need sustained investment . "
mr blair may have most of the delegates in manchester whistling to his tune but the question now is how far he can get ordinary voters humming along to what seems to be a " things can only get even better " theme .

her husband , jesus antonio munoz , buried her on saturday after sitting by her coffin in vigil over friday night .
he told bbc today reporter john manell about the excruciating discovery of her death .
early thursday morning , my sister called me and i put on the television .
i suspected straight away that something could have happened to my wife because the time of her train coincided with what happened .
you can never be completely sure because there is always some hope left .
but i knew the probability would be high .
i ca n't describe it but i had a dreadful feeling .
i started watching television at 0800 in the morning .
by 0930 i was completely consumed by the fear that my wife had died .
but you do n't lose hope .
you keep struggling to find out .
the search we were looking in all the hospitals during all that day and all the night .
myself and the people who were with me - i was accompanied by three people from the spanish television channel where i work and telefonica , the company where my wife worked - we set ourselves the task of trying to find her by phone , trying to find out where she was .
we could n't find her anywhere .
in all this it 's a terrible feeling - not to know anything , not to know whether or not you might have to go and identify or collect the corpse of your wife .
during the night in the room where we were waiting there was a certain protocol .
i did n't realise what was going on at first , but little by little it dawned on me .
each time they were about to tell a family bad news , a counsellor came alongside them to help .
they were giving out tranquillisers .
and that was how i was to find out my wife was dead .
the end at a little past 0800 , i called emergency services and gave her name .
the person who answered the phone was very nervous .
she directed me to the place where the doctors would have more information .
minutes later , they offered me a pill .
and then , although i did n't say anything to any of my family , i was absolutely convinced that my wife was dead .
that was it .
the end .
i 've always thought the same about terrorism - in madrid as much as anywhere else in the world .
and that is that it 's meaningless .
when you use force to make a point , there will be a backlash against you , and that will be either as big or bigger than the problem was to begin with .
child again it 's absurd .
i do n't feel any repulsion .
i do n't know - indifference .
the only thing i know is that they 've torn out my heart .
and now i 'm like a child of five years old .
now i 've got to start everything again - becoming an adult all over again .
i 've got to say that it 's all the same to me - whether it 's eta , or al-qaeda , or any other group of terrorists .
to me it 's the same feeling .
the only thing i know is that they 've snatched away a part of my life and nobody can bring it back .
i do n't care who they are .
i do n't care what happens to the people who did it .
when you bury a person , the pain is that it is the last moment when you have that person next to you and when the ceremony ends you hand that person over to god .
you do n't lose them , but you stop having them at your side through everything .
