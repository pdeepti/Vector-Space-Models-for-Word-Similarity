pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 .

prior to their talks , schröder called for muslim countries to send peacekeepers to stabilize iraq . after talks with belgian premier guy verhofstadt on tuesday , schröder said germany had no intention of blocking a u.s.-driven plan for a nato mission in iraq .
such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .
but he added that it was important to think about whether iraqis would accept nato troops any more than those from the current coalition led by the u.s. and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair during an earlier meeting schröder made it clear that germany would not send troops to iraq even if a nato mission is approved .
he also reiterated his suggestion to bring in peacekeepers from muslim countries , saying that they were more likely to be welcomed by the iraqis .
so far , no muslim country has publicly offered to participate in a peacekeeping mission in iraq . on sunday , u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice told berlin daily der tagesspiegel that she also hoped muslim countries would agree to send peacekeeping groups .
" it would be helpful , " she said .
" we hope that these governments will decide to do it once we have a un resolution . " new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 . " any person with a conscience who saw what happened and had neither the resolve nor the capacity to act when the hurricanes of hatred reaped 7,000 lives in srebrenica knows that this shameful inability -lrb- to act -rrb- can not go on , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de widespread fraud alleged in european parliament a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .

prior to their talks , schröder called for muslim countries to send peacekeepers to stabilize iraq . after talks with belgian premier guy verhofstadt on tuesday , schröder said germany had no intention of blocking a u.s.-driven plan for a nato mission in iraq .
such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .

so far , no muslim country has publicly offered to participate in a peacekeeping mission in iraq . on sunday , u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice told berlin daily der tagesspiegel that she also hoped muslim countries would agree to send peacekeeping groups .

" we hope that these governments will decide to do it once we have a un resolution . " new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 . " any person with a conscience who saw what happened and had neither the resolve nor the capacity to act when the hurricanes of hatred reaped 7,000 lives in srebrenica knows that this shameful inability -lrb- to act -rrb- can not go on , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de widespread fraud alleged in european parliament a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .

prior to their talks , schröder called for muslim countries to send peacekeepers to stabilize iraq . after talks with belgian premier guy verhofstadt on tuesday , schröder said germany had no intention of blocking a u.s.-driven plan for a nato mission in iraq .
such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .

the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .

but he added that it was important to think about whether iraqis would accept nato troops any more than those from the current coalition led by the u.s. and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair during an earlier meeting schröder made it clear that germany would not send troops to iraq even if a nato mission is approved .
he also reiterated his suggestion to bring in peacekeepers from muslim countries , saying that they were more likely to be welcomed by the iraqis .
so far , no muslim country has publicly offered to participate in a peacekeeping mission in iraq . on sunday , u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice told berlin daily der tagesspiegel that she also hoped muslim countries would agree to send peacekeeping groups .
" it would be helpful , " she said .
" we hope that these governments will decide to do it once we have a un resolution . " new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 .

prior to their talks , schröder called for muslim countries to send peacekeepers to stabilize iraq . after talks with belgian premier guy verhofstadt on tuesday , schröder said germany had no intention of blocking a u.s.-driven plan for a nato mission in iraq .
such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .

he also reiterated his suggestion to bring in peacekeepers from muslim countries , saying that they were more likely to be welcomed by the iraqis .
so far , no muslim country has publicly offered to participate in a peacekeeping mission in iraq . on sunday , u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice told berlin daily der tagesspiegel that she also hoped muslim countries would agree to send peacekeeping groups .
" it would be helpful , " she said .
" we hope that these governments will decide to do it once we have a un resolution . " new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .
but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .

talks to reach a compromise on the law collapsed earlier this month after the junior coalition partner , the greens , said they were n't prepared to make any more concessions to the opposition .
the government has since said it will give the negotiations one last try .
but following a two-day conference in berlin , integration officers warned against passing a watered-down version of the law at any price , and said that the original intention to create a modern , forward-thinking approach to immigration has been lost .
" we 've watched with great concern while the actual intention of this law has been pushed aside to become a law that is increasingly about security and anti-terrorism , " said the federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck .
she said that as the european union grows together and seeks more common policies , national laws to regulate immigration and asylum policy will have less of a place , adding that if the government 's final attempt at drafting a law fails , she wo n't be overly upset . more briefs 20.05.2004 -pipe- schily praises german police in afghanistan 19.05.2004 -pipe- german probe blames late warning in 2002 air collision 19.05.2004 -pipe- prison for policeman with handbag fetish 18.05.2004 -pipe- schröder slapped by angry man at party meeting 18.05.2004 -pipe- german prosecutors say algerian terror leader captured 18.05.2004 -pipe- bayern munich 's coach gets the ax 18.05.2004 -pipe- deutsche oper director quits over money 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.05.2004 cox awarded charlemagne prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cox has devoted his political life to the european cause .
pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 . " any person with a conscience who saw what happened and had neither the resolve nor the capacity to act when the hurricanes of hatred reaped 7,000 lives in srebrenica knows that this shameful inability -lrb- to act -rrb- can not go on , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de widespread fraud alleged in european parliament a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 .

prior to their talks , schröder called for muslim countries to send peacekeepers to stabilize iraq . after talks with belgian premier guy verhofstadt on tuesday , schröder said germany had no intention of blocking a u.s.-driven plan for a nato mission in iraq .
such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .
but he added that it was important to think about whether iraqis would accept nato troops any more than those from the current coalition led by the u.s. and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair during an earlier meeting schröder made it clear that germany would not send troops to iraq even if a nato mission is approved .
he also reiterated his suggestion to bring in peacekeepers from muslim countries , saying that they were more likely to be welcomed by the iraqis .
so far , no muslim country has publicly offered to participate in a peacekeeping mission in iraq . on sunday , u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice told berlin daily der tagesspiegel that she also hoped muslim countries would agree to send peacekeeping groups .
" it would be helpful , " she said .
" we hope that these governments will decide to do it once we have a un resolution . " new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .
but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .

such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .

prior to their talks , schröder called for muslim countries to send peacekeepers to stabilize iraq . after talks with belgian premier guy verhofstadt on tuesday , schröder said germany had no intention of blocking a u.s.-driven plan for a nato mission in iraq .
such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .
but he added that it was important to think about whether iraqis would accept nato troops any more than those from the current coalition led by the u.s. and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair during an earlier meeting schröder made it clear that germany would not send troops to iraq even if a nato mission is approved .
he also reiterated his suggestion to bring in peacekeepers from muslim countries , saying that they were more likely to be welcomed by the iraqis .
so far , no muslim country has publicly offered to participate in a peacekeeping mission in iraq . on sunday , u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice told berlin daily der tagesspiegel that she also hoped muslim countries would agree to send peacekeeping groups .
" it would be helpful , " she said .
" we hope that these governments will decide to do it once we have a un resolution . " new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .
but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 . " any person with a conscience who saw what happened and had neither the resolve nor the capacity to act when the hurricanes of hatred reaped 7,000 lives in srebrenica knows that this shameful inability -lrb- to act -rrb- can not go on , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de widespread fraud alleged in european parliament a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .

such a mission could be approved at the alliance 's next summit in istanbul at the end of june . nato requires all member states to approve missions . " we 're not going to block the wishes of others , " said schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war .

" new un resolution crucial during their meeting on wednesday , schröder and blair discussed the proposed new un resolution , which is needed to recognize the iraqi government that 's scheduled to take over on june 30 .
the resolution would also authorize the ongoing presence of foreign armies in iraq . british officials have said they will only stay in iraq if the country 's new sovereign government approves this . " if they do not want troops there , then we will leave , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a bbc interview . rice on sunday agreed that the iraqis will be in control after june 30 .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be , " she said in an interview with german public television ard .

pat cox , the outgoing european parliament president , has been awarded germany 's prestigious charlemagne prize for his efforts to unite europe - or what the irishman describes as " the political cause of my life . " the jury awarding the charlemagne prize has described cox as a " dynamic full-blooded european " and as one who stands for a democratic europe unlike any other .
the prize is awarded annually in recognition of personal contributions to european unity . when the 51-year-old irishman collected the distinguished charlemagne prize in germany 's historic city of aachen on thursday , he spoke of the crowning achievement that was eu enlargement on may 1 .
now that the historic date has passed , he said it is up to all eu citizens to discover and realize europe 's potential .
cox also spoke of the need to adopt a strong , yet simple constitution for the eu . aiming higher although cox is the outgoing president of the european parliament , many eu observers expect that he 'll return to european politics , possible for an even higher post . it 's no secret that the outspoken cox , a former tv journalist and father of six , is nursing ambitions to succeed european commission president romano prodi later this year . " serving as an mep for 15 years and as president for almost two and half years has been the great experience of my life , " cox said during his emotional farewell from the european parliament earlier this month . from dublin to brussels born in dublin on november 28 , 1952 as the son of a watchmaker , cox grew up in limerick .
he graduated with a degree in economics at trinity college in dublin and lectured in the subject at the university of limerick . cox switched to journalism and worked for irish broadcaster rte from 1982 to 1986 , hosting current affairs programs including the popular " today tonight . " he began his political career in 1985 when he joined the progressive democrats in ireland and became the party 's general secretary .
he gradually began to distance himself from irish politics following differences with the party and began to focus on the eu instead after he joined the european liberal democrats in 1989 as a liberal mep for munster in southern ireland . cox was elected president of the european parliament in january 2002 .
he has since transformed the public image of the assembly with his media savvy and his catchy " sound bite " presidential style that is attributed to his media background . fraud and perks scandal cast shadow but cox 's commitment to making the european parliament more transparent suffered a serious setback in march this year .
austrian mep hans-peter martin went to the press with fraud allegations , including accusations that hundreds of his colleagues were pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they had not attended . cox promised an investigation to clear up the matter .
earlier this month he acknowledged that the most disappointing part of his presidency was failing to overhaul the parliament 's pay and perks system , which he admitted continues to give the assembly a bad name . a passionate believer in united europe cox , a passionate supporter of european expansion and unity , has listed the smooth expansion of the eu by ten new states as one of his major achievements during his term as president . during the expansion celebrations in dublin in early may , cox defended his strong belief in a common european foreign and defense policy , saying it was vital to prevent bloody ethnic conflicts and massacres such as the one that took place in srebrenica , bosnia in 1995 . " any person with a conscience who saw what happened and had neither the resolve nor the capacity to act when the hurricanes of hatred reaped 7,000 lives in srebrenica knows that this shameful inability -lrb- to act -rrb- can not go on , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de widespread fraud alleged in european parliament a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .

a poll of more than 1,500 people by market analysts mintel found 52 % support for a ban , including two-thirds of non-smokers .
around one in three smokers also backed the idea but 25 % said they would avoid places where a ban was in force .
pressure is building for the uk to follow the irish republic , which introduced a workplace ban this april . "
the fact that a significant proportion of smokers support a ban on smoking in public places highlights that many do have a conscience " amanda lintott in recent weeks the british medical association , the royal college of nursing and the chief medical officer have urged the government to outlaw smoking in pubs , restaurants and workplaces .
a study published this week by imperial college london found that second-hand tobacco smoke at work kills hundreds of britons each year - including almost one hospitality industry worker a week .
amanda lintott , a mintel consumer analyst , said : " the fact that a significant proportion of smokers support a ban on smoking in public places highlights that many do have a conscience .
" they are aware that their habit can be detrimental not only to their own health , but also to the health of those around them . "
the research also found that 15 % of smokers would quit smoking if a ban were to be introduced .
other findings included : 27 % of all adults - and 18 % of smokers - object to the taxpayer footing the bill for treating smoking-related illness only 25 % of all adults believe the policy of heavy taxation to discourage smoking is flawed only 34 % of consumers - and 29 % of smokers - believe hard-hitting anti-smoking campaigns are the best way to discourage smoking almost 70 % of smokers believe that giving up smoking is all down to willpower over a quarter -lrb- 26 % -rrb- of smokers who would like to quit do not believe that products such as nicotine gum and patches would help them research has shown that more than a quarter -lrb- 28 % -rrb- of all adults smoke , while 43 % have tried to give up at some point - and around one fifth -lrb- 21 % -rrb- are trying to do so now .
ian willmore , of the charity action on smoking and health , said : " this is yet another piece of evidence that public opinion wants action on the dangers of second-hand smoke .
" an end to smoking in the workplace would save perhaps 700 non-smokers ' lives every year in the uk and would help many thousands of smokers to quit .
" a new law is necessary and overdue .
the time for consultation is over - the time for government action has arrived . "
smokers ' rights simon clark , director of the smokers ' rights organisation forest , said the report posed more questions than it answered .
" for instance , were respondents given the choice of smoking and no-smoking areas or better ventilation as alternatives to a ban , or were they simply asked to choose between smoking being allowed or prohibited ?
" of course some smokers will support a total ban but , according to this report , that still leaves 71 % opposed to a ban .
" that is a hell of a lot of people and they need to be accommodated , especially in pubs , clubs and restaurants , otherwise a lot of people , and businesses , are going to suffer .
" the truth is that most independent research suggests that while a large majority favour restrictions on smoking , only a minority support a total ban in pubs and restaurants .
this report , while interesting , does n't change that . "

those are just some of the allegations that could bring another mass walk-out to a troubled royal mail centre .
the oxford centre has already suffered a 17-day strike over bullying claims which left millions of items of post undelivered throughout april .
one month on , and talks to avert another crippling strike are taking place following revelations that confidential witness statements fell into the hands of those at the centre of the allegations .
royal mail bosses have said they " very much regret " the error and are carrying out an internal inquiry .
we are confident in the integrity of the investigation team and will not hesitate to take action if the complaints are upheld royal mail manager michael stockdale but workers say more needs to be done to tackle a climate of intimidation that has built up at the cowley centre over the last two years .
one group of workers is alleged to have verbally abused and attacked colleagues and sexually harassed female workers .
there have also been claims that those who made the allegations received threats at their own homes and even saw the accused outside their children 's schools .
some of the centre 's 450 workers have resigned and others were said to be close to doing so .
bob cullen , the local representative of the communication workers union , has worked at the centre for the past 18 years .
the last strike saw millions of letters go undelivered he told bbc news online : " this is concentrated on a handful of individuals over a long period against a whole shift . "
michael stockdale , the royal mail 's general manager for the thames valley , said the allegations were being taken " extremely seriously " .
but he declined to comment on whether he felt the scale of the problem had been exaggerated , saying : " these specific allegations are still being investigated by an independent team from outside the oxford area and it would be wholly wrong of us to prejudge any outcome . "
union members are now to meet on sunday to consider whether to hold a ballot on strike action over how the inquiries are being carried out .
' personal danger ' they are unhappy that , while an independent inquiry is planned , the bullying claims are still being probed by royal mail managers .
action has yet to be taken against any member of staff while those inquiries continue .
mr stockdale , who said talks with the union were so far " positive " , said : " we are confident in the integrity of the investigation team and will not hesitate to take action if the complaints are upheld .
" bullying and harassment of staff simply is not acceptable in any circumstances and is an extremely serious issue , but that does not mean we should forfeit the investigative process simply for a quick - but possibly flawed - solution . "
the two sides also agree on the need to resolve the problems at the centre as quickly as possible amid growing public discontent with the city 's postal service .
mr cullen said : " we are aware that the public is facing extreme difficulty getting their mail .
a number of women workers are said to have been harassed " we do not take the view of striking lightly .
" but we will not have people coming to work in conditions where they feel in personal danger and we will not have people 's homes visited and children 's schools visited . "
for the thousands of residents and businesses which suffered during the last strike , another walk-out could be the last straw .
a spokeswoman for watchdog group postwatch called for every effort to be made to avoid further strike action .

those are just some of the allegations that could bring another mass walk-out to a troubled royal mail centre .
the oxford centre has already suffered a 17-day strike over bullying claims which left millions of items of post undelivered throughout april .
one month on , and talks to avert another crippling strike are taking place following revelations that confidential witness statements fell into the hands of those at the centre of the allegations .
royal mail bosses have said they " very much regret " the error and are carrying out an internal inquiry .
we are confident in the integrity of the investigation team and will not hesitate to take action if the complaints are upheld royal mail manager michael stockdale but workers say more needs to be done to tackle a climate of intimidation that has built up at the cowley centre over the last two years .
one group of workers is alleged to have verbally abused and attacked colleagues and sexually harassed female workers .
there have also been claims that those who made the allegations received threats at their own homes and even saw the accused outside their children 's schools .
some of the centre 's 450 workers have resigned and others were said to be close to doing so .
bob cullen , the local representative of the communication workers union , has worked at the centre for the past 18 years .
the last strike saw millions of letters go undelivered he told bbc news online : " this is concentrated on a handful of individuals over a long period against a whole shift . "
michael stockdale , the royal mail 's general manager for the thames valley , said the allegations were being taken " extremely seriously " .
but he declined to comment on whether he felt the scale of the problem had been exaggerated , saying : " these specific allegations are still being investigated by an independent team from outside the oxford area and it would be wholly wrong of us to prejudge any outcome . "
union members are now to meet on sunday to consider whether to hold a ballot on strike action over how the inquiries are being carried out .
' personal danger ' they are unhappy that , while an independent inquiry is planned , the bullying claims are still being probed by royal mail managers .
action has yet to be taken against any member of staff while those inquiries continue .
mr stockdale , who said talks with the union were so far " positive " , said : " we are confident in the integrity of the investigation team and will not hesitate to take action if the complaints are upheld .
" bullying and harassment of staff simply is not acceptable in any circumstances and is an extremely serious issue , but that does not mean we should forfeit the investigative process simply for a quick - but possibly flawed - solution . "
the two sides also agree on the need to resolve the problems at the centre as quickly as possible amid growing public discontent with the city 's postal service .
mr cullen said : " we are aware that the public is facing extreme difficulty getting their mail .
a number of women workers are said to have been harassed " we do not take the view of striking lightly .
" but we will not have people coming to work in conditions where they feel in personal danger and we will not have people 's homes visited and children 's schools visited . "
for the thousands of residents and businesses which suffered during the last strike , another walk-out could be the last straw .

those are just some of the allegations that could bring another mass walk-out to a troubled royal mail centre .
the oxford centre has already suffered a 17-day strike over bullying claims which left millions of items of post undelivered throughout april .
one month on , and talks to avert another crippling strike are taking place following revelations that confidential witness statements fell into the hands of those at the centre of the allegations .
royal mail bosses have said they " very much regret " the error and are carrying out an internal inquiry .
we are confident in the integrity of the investigation team and will not hesitate to take action if the complaints are upheld royal mail manager michael stockdale but workers say more needs to be done to tackle a climate of intimidation that has built up at the cowley centre over the last two years .
one group of workers is alleged to have verbally abused and attacked colleagues and sexually harassed female workers .
there have also been claims that those who made the allegations received threats at their own homes and even saw the accused outside their children 's schools .
some of the centre 's 450 workers have resigned and others were said to be close to doing so .
bob cullen , the local representative of the communication workers union , has worked at the centre for the past 18 years .
the last strike saw millions of letters go undelivered he told bbc news online : " this is concentrated on a handful of individuals over a long period against a whole shift . "
michael stockdale , the royal mail 's general manager for the thames valley , said the allegations were being taken " extremely seriously " .
but he declined to comment on whether he felt the scale of the problem had been exaggerated , saying : " these specific allegations are still being investigated by an independent team from outside the oxford area and it would be wholly wrong of us to prejudge any outcome . "
union members are now to meet on sunday to consider whether to hold a ballot on strike action over how the inquiries are being carried out .
' personal danger ' they are unhappy that , while an independent inquiry is planned , the bullying claims are still being probed by royal mail managers .
action has yet to be taken against any member of staff while those inquiries continue .
mr stockdale , who said talks with the union were so far " positive " , said : " we are confident in the integrity of the investigation team and will not hesitate to take action if the complaints are upheld .
" bullying and harassment of staff simply is not acceptable in any circumstances and is an extremely serious issue , but that does not mean we should forfeit the investigative process simply for a quick - but possibly flawed - solution . "
the two sides also agree on the need to resolve the problems at the centre as quickly as possible amid growing public discontent with the city 's postal service .
mr cullen said : " we are aware that the public is facing extreme difficulty getting their mail .
a number of women workers are said to have been harassed " we do not take the view of striking lightly .
" but we will not have people coming to work in conditions where they feel in personal danger and we will not have people 's homes visited and children 's schools visited . "
for the thousands of residents and businesses which suffered during the last strike , another walk-out could be the last straw .
a spokeswoman for watchdog group postwatch called for every effort to be made to avoid further strike action .
she said : " basically , the royal mail and the unions should be working together to restore confidence in the postal service .
something has to be done . "

not one candidate has put their name forward for any of the seven seats in the seaside village of pendine .
existing councillors are refusing to stand after being told they could be held responsible for accidents on the beach .
carmarthenshire council is now looking to see if it can take temporary charge of its duties . "
at this time there is little to attract anyone to volunteer to take on the responsibility of an unpaid community councillor " council clerk paul wilkins these include street-lighting , grass cutting , beach cleaning and running the village hall .
pendine is made up of about 130 homes although more than 60,000 people come to visit every year .
as the revenue it gets from council tax is only £ 3,000 the authority has raised extra money - around £ 20,000 a year - by charging cars to park on a half-mile stretch of land it owns at the beach .
most of the remaining foreshore is owned by the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- which has a base at pendine .
corporate manslaughter a risk study done by the royal society for the prevention of accidents has found that vehicles on the sands - including an increasing number of quad bikes - are an unacceptable danger .
it has advised councillors that land owners - or those allowing access to the beach - could face corporate manslaughter charges if there is a fatal accident .
the council has now blocked off its slip-way to the beach and is no longer charging for parking - but that means it can not afford to pay for services .
community council clerk paul wilkins said : " the loss of over £ 20,000 income from vehicle charges will mean the council will have to rely on a £ 3,000 precept .
" this is clearly insufficient for most , if not all , of the current services and facilities it provides . "
members had also been concerned they could be held responsible for accidents on the sands , he said .
cut-off date " in the absence of any indication of a solution to the problems facing the council and the possible liability to prosecution , at this time there is little to attract anyone to volunteer to take on the responsibility of an unpaid community councillor . "
carmarthenshire council says it will work with pendine council and the mod to try and resolve the problems .
in the meantime , chief executive mark james said the authority may take over some of its duties .
the cut-off date for election nominations had now passed so no community council election would be held in pendine .
" the county council has powers in certain circumstances to assist community councils who find themselves in difficulties of this nature , " he explained .

not one candidate has put their name forward for any of the seven seats in the seaside village of pendine .
existing councillors are refusing to stand after being told they could be held responsible for accidents on the beach .
carmarthenshire council is now looking to see if it can take temporary charge of its duties .
at this time there is little to attract anyone to volunteer to take on the responsibility of an unpaid community councillor council clerk paul wilkins these include street-lighting , grass cutting , beach cleaning and running the village hall .
pendine is made up of about 130 homes although more than 60,000 people come to visit every year .
as the revenue it gets from council tax is only £ 3,000 the authority has raised extra money - around £ 20,000 a year - by charging cars to park on a half-mile stretch of land it owns at the beach .
most of the remaining foreshore is owned by the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- which has a base at pendine .
corporate manslaughter a risk study done by the royal society for the prevention of accidents has found that vehicles on the sands - including an increasing number of quad bikes - are an unacceptable danger .
it has advised councillors that land owners - or those allowing access to the beach - could face corporate manslaughter charges if there is a fatal accident .
the council has now blocked off its slip-way to the beach and is no longer charging for parking - but that means it can not afford to pay for services .
community council clerk paul wilkins said : " the loss of over £ 20,000 income from vehicle charges will mean the council will have to rely on a £ 3,000 precept .
" this is clearly insufficient for most , if not all , of the current services and facilities it provides . "
members had also been concerned they could be held responsible for accidents on the sands , he said .
cut-off date " in the absence of any indication of a solution to the problems facing the council and the possible liability to prosecution , at this time there is little to attract anyone to volunteer to take on the responsibility of an unpaid community councillor . "
carmarthenshire council says it will work with pendine council and the mod to try and resolve the problems .
in the meantime , chief executive mark james said the authority may take over some of its duties .
the cut-off date for election nominations had now passed so no community council election would be held in pendine .
" the county council has powers in certain circumstances to assist community councils who find themselves in difficulties of this nature , " he explained .

the £ 97,000 temporary facility will be housed on a disused car park at beckery old road , morlands , glastonbury .
judi hawkins , from local skateboarders group urban surfers , said : " until now young people in the area had nowhere safe to skate .
" now we 've got the park we can concentrate our efforts on fundraising the £ 60,000 needed to buy extra equipment for the park . "
david rees , from the south west regional development agency 's -lrb- rda -rrb- somerset team , said : " redevelopment of the site will obviously be long term .
new location " it makes sense that community groups like the urban surfers are able to use the land on a temporary basis in the meantime . "
the park has been designed using materials which will be easy to move to a new location in the future .
construction work is expected to be completed in the next few weeks , with the skate park up-and-running by july .
the 40-acre former tannery is being transformed and redeveloped by the south west rda , mendip district council , businesses and the local community .

the bank of japan said in its monthly economic health check that a jump in exports had lifted business investment , while domestic demand had also firmed .
" japan 's economy is expected to gain further momentum gradually , " it said .
the bank added that it would keep short-term interest rates effectively at zero , as widely expected .
the report comes days after official data showed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 5.6 % during the first three months of the year .
the figures , which comfortably outstripped analysts ' forecasts , marked japan 's eighth consecutive quarter of growth .
tighter money mounting evidence of a recovery has triggered speculation that the bank of japan , which has adopted an ultra-loose monetary policy in an effort to kick-start the economy , may tighten its stance sooner than expected .
its officials have previously signalled that rates will not rise until japan 's chronic deflation - where falling prices act as a brake on consumer spending - is over .
but the bank suggested on thursday that while the soaring cost of oil and other commodities had helped counteract deflation , there is as yet little sign of a sustained increase in prices .
" the year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices , excluding fresh food , has been close to zero , while temporary factors have exerted upward pressure on prices , " it said .
figures out on tuesday showed that the broadest measure of japanese prices fell by 2.6 % in the first quarter .
some analysts believe the bank may in fact loosen monetary policy further in the months ahead if higher oil prices or an abrupt slowdown in china start to weigh on global growth .
" i expect the bank of japan to ease further if we have a sudden rise in the yen , a big slowdown in china , or big swings in domestic stock or bond markets , " said yasuo goto at mitsubishi research institute .

in a report , published on thursday , the committee of public accounts at westminster found that the executive 's strategic management of homelessness was " poor " .
the committee said that the numbers of families forced to spend long periods in bed and breakfast accommodation was unacceptable .
it said the department of social development was guilty of a lack of control over the housing executive and failed to monitor its delivery of services the report stated : " nihe took 14 years to develop its first formal homelessness strategy .
" this shows a disturbing level of complacency about meeting its statutory duty towards some of the most vulnerable members of society . "
committee chairman edward leigh mp said the findings were very worrying .
" i am very concerned that it took nihe so long to devise a strategy for getting to grip with the growing homelessness problem and that the department exercised so little control over the quality of service being provided . "
improvements ' encouraging ' recognising that the executive was now putting in place its homelessness strategy , the conservative mp said the improvements were encouraging and long overdue .
the housing executive published proposals for its homelessness strategy in september 2002 and is currently in the process of implementing it .
last week , the executive announced a £ 1.4m funding package to help tackle homelessness across the province .
this increased its annual spending on homelessness to £ 26.6m.
chief executive paddy mcintyre said that the numbers of people claiming to be homeless had remained static at about 8,500 per year .
but he added that last year , almost four out of five homeless families had been permanently rehoused within six months .
" the housing executive placed 4,500 households in temporary accommodation last year .
by the end of march 2004 we had met the government 's target and had no homeless families with children in b & b accommodation for longer than six weeks . "
commenting on the falling numbers of people forced into b & bs , mr mcintyre said that most of the temporary accommodation provided by the housing executive was self-contained .
" in recent months , a number of new community-based homeless hostels have been opened by the housing executive , and others will follow later this year . "

miss ward , 28 , who lived near bury st edmunds , died while travelling in the masai mara game reserve in kenya .
earlier this month a coroner found that she had been unlawfully killed .
on thursday , david rowe , 70 , a former assistant commissioner of the kenyan police , said his part in the case was unfairly represented at an inquest .
mr rowe , who is english and has a house in capel st mary , suffolk , said he was considering contacting coroner peter dean to offer his side of the story .
miss ward vanished in 1988 and her killers have never been found .

her skull and spine were found nearby . "

he has complained that the foreign office and metropolitan police , whose detectives travelled to kenya to help in the investigation , colluded in the cover up so as to placate moi .
the complaint is being investigated by a team of lincolnshire police detectives which is due to present its report to the police complaints commission later this year .
the new kenyan government has indicated that it will launch a new inquiry and mr ward is due to travel to kenya for discussions in the near future .

the inquest was told that in the aftermath of miss ward 's death mr rowe , who had left the police force but was working as a consultant , discussed the case during a meeting at his house with an mi6 agent , named as " mr a " .
mr a had logged details of the meeting in a file at mi6 headquarters .
but when questioned by lincolnshire detectives last year neither mr rowe or mr a had mentioned the meeting .
mr ward said mr rowe had put forward the theory that miss ward could have been struck by lightning so fierce that it snapped her bones .
the british pathologist who examined her remains told the inquest that the suggestion was nonsensical .
denies ' lightning ' claim on thursday , mr rowe said he had been in kenya since november last year and only returned to his house in suffolk this week .
he said he had not realised that the inquest was being held .
he said he had not mentioned the meeting with mr a to police because he had forgotten about it .

the new kenyan government has indicated that it will launch a new inquiry and mr ward is due to travel to kenya for discussions in the near future .
kenyan authorities said julie ward had been killed by animals mr rowe did not attend the inquest - although the coroner said he had been invited .
the inquest was told that in the aftermath of miss ward 's death mr rowe , who had left the police force but was working as a consultant , discussed the case during a meeting at his house with an mi6 agent , named as " mr a " .
mr a had logged details of the meeting in a file at mi6 headquarters .
but when questioned by lincolnshire detectives last year neither mr rowe or mr a had mentioned the meeting .
mr ward said mr rowe had put forward the theory that miss ward could have been struck by lightning so fierce that it snapped her bones .
the british pathologist who examined her remains told the inquest that the suggestion was nonsensical .
denies ' lightning ' claim on thursday , mr rowe said he had been in kenya since november last year and only returned to his house in suffolk this week .
he said he had not realised that the inquest was being held .
he said he had not mentioned the meeting with mr a to police because he had forgotten about it .
he denied saying that miss ward had been hit by lightning .
he said he had merely suggested that lighting could be the cause of a fire in the bush .
" we left for kenya in november and were staying up country .
i did n't know the inquest was taking place , " he said .

mr rowe , who is english and has a house in capel st mary , suffolk , said he was considering contacting coroner peter dean to offer his side of the story .
miss ward vanished in 1988 and her killers have never been found .

mr a had logged details of the meeting in a file at mi6 headquarters .
but when questioned by lincolnshire detectives last year neither mr rowe or mr a had mentioned the meeting .
mr ward said mr rowe had put forward the theory that miss ward could have been struck by lightning so fierce that it snapped her bones .
the british pathologist who examined her remains told the inquest that the suggestion was nonsensical .

page was invited to cardiff castle after his contribution to a new book about the architect william burges , who transformed the castle 's interior .
a fan of the victorian architect 's work , page lives in the house which burges designed for himself in london and allowed it to be featured in a new book on burges .
page paid his last visit to the castle more than 30 years ago when his band played in the city , but he was not allowed inside .
" i was beating on the door in 1973 , when i was playing in led zeppelin , " he said .
" we were staying in the angel hotel and it was tantalisingly close , but they were doing it up or something at the time and i could n't get in . "
' wonderful world ' page added that his love for burges ' work began as a teenager .
" i had an interest going back to my teens in the pre-raphaelite movement and the architecture of burges , " he said .
" what a wonderful world to discover . "
in 1972 , he bought burges ' london residence , the tower house , which carries the architect 's trademark attention to detail .
" i was still finding things 20 years after being there - a little beetle on the wall or something like that , " page said .
" it 's burges ' attention to detail that is so fascinating . "
tower house is the only property designed by burges which is currently not open to the public .
but after hearing a request from cardiff castle curator matthew williams , page allowed pictures of his home to be featured in the new book , called william burges , written by mr williams .
" if you have the privilege of living in a house like this and find someone else who is just as passionate about it , of course you want to help , " said page .
extravagant designs mr williams said he wanted to write a book about burges ' work and was thrilled when page allowed him to photograph rooms of tower house .
" the book took about eight months to complete and a lot of research went into it as well as trying to get pictures of his work , " mr williams added .
" jimmy page was very good and let us into his home to take pictures , and it is really nice to see those pictures in the book because tower house is n't open to the public .
" the last book on burges was written 23 years ago and it was quite an in-depth book , so i wanted to create a book which would be a lot more accessible to people . "
the reputation of william burges -lrb- 1827-1881 -rrb- rests on his extravagant designs and his contribution to the gothic revival in architecture in the nineteenth century .
as well as cardiff castle and tower house , burges designed the lavish interior of castell coch , on the outskirts of cardiff .

pay and pension disputes mean about 7,000 rail maritime and transport union members are expected to back a walkout .
the rmt says it may join strike action by train workers with london underground strikes , where its members are involved in a separate pay row .
rail industry bosses have said every 24-hour strike would cost over £ 12m .
a co-ordinated strike could spark the worst bout of industrial action on the railways for over a decade .
rmt general secretary bob crow is expected to announce the ballot result later on thursday .
stalemate sources within network rail have warned every 24-hour strike would cause losses of between £ 12m and £ 15m .
" every single day the rmt is on strike , the pay available to settle the dispute goes down .
the 3.5 % being offered by network rail is worth £ 21m , so that would be wiped out within two days of a strike , " a source said .
the rmt is also lobbying network rail to end its refusal to offer a final salary pension scheme to new entrants .
mr crow said : " network rail are under pressure to save money and they are trying to do it at our members ' expense .
" they have imposed a cheaper and inferior pension scheme on new starters without a word of negotiation , purely to save money , " he added .
