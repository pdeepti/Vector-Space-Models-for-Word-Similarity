critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

" as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . " there is an extraordinary amount of overhead in germany , of uniformed people that have nothing to do with budget , that have everything to do with running installations , guarding installations , managing housing , and all that stuff that counts against our endstrength , " he said .

both divisions are involved in operations in iraq . schoomaker refrained from providing details of the troop reductions .

the clause gives the eu the possibility of delaying entry for a year , if commitments made by candidate countries during negotiations are not met . during a series of meetings between the three sides on tuesday in luxembourg it was confirmed that the two countries would face a tougher monitoring system prior to accession to the union .
romania and bulgaria are expected to become eu members in 2007 , and the reinforced systems are intended to ensure that reforms will continue in both countries until that time .
bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .
romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said he was astonished by the speed with which bulgaria accepted the safeguard clause .
geoana added that it happened " over the weekend . "
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen confirmed that he would make the same proposal for a safeguard clause for romania , too .

" as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . " there is an extraordinary amount of overhead in germany , of uniformed people that have nothing to do with budget , that have everything to do with running installations , guarding installations , managing housing , and all that stuff that counts against our endstrength , " he said .

both divisions are involved in operations in iraq . schoomaker refrained from providing details of the troop reductions .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .
" he 's supported by the right-wing left and the left-wing right .

the announcement , which was made in frankfurt on wednesday , said the 53-year-old writer had not only redefined the position of his hungarian homeland in the center of europe , but also the position of europe in the center of literature .
born in 1950 , the author belongs to the post-modern generation of hungarian literature .
his main work , ' celestial harmonies ' , which tells the story of his family history , was at the top of the best seller list in hungary for months , and won him several awards .
esterhazy was one of just a handful of authors to begin writing about the absurdities of every day life in a socialist state before the political transition in eastern europe .
he first gained recognition in germany in the mid 1980s , with the publication of ' little hungarian pornography ' , in which he uses anecdotes and fragmented accounts to describe the perversions of daily life in hungary . dw-world.de susan sontag receives german peace prize , criticizes u.s. with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday .

countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .

many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .

brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections .

the clause gives the eu the possibility of delaying entry for a year , if commitments made by candidate countries during negotiations are not met . during a series of meetings between the three sides on tuesday in luxembourg it was confirmed that the two countries would face a tougher monitoring system prior to accession to the union .
romania and bulgaria are expected to become eu members in 2007 , and the reinforced systems are intended to ensure that reforms will continue in both countries until that time .
bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .
romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said he was astonished by the speed with which bulgaria accepted the safeguard clause .
geoana added that it happened " over the weekend . "
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen confirmed that he would make the same proposal for a safeguard clause for romania , too .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 russia 's wealthiest man goes on trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters say the kremlin is behind the tycoon 's trial billionaire businessman mikhail khodorkovsky went on trial wednesday for tax evasion and fraud .
critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc year-long delay possible for future eu members the eu will be able to delay bulgaria and romania from joining the bloc for a year under a new safeguard clause now being proposed .
the clause gives the eu the possibility of delaying entry for a year , if commitments made by candidate countries during negotiations are not met . during a series of meetings between the three sides on tuesday in luxembourg it was confirmed that the two countries would face a tougher monitoring system prior to accession to the union .
romania and bulgaria are expected to become eu members in 2007 , and the reinforced systems are intended to ensure that reforms will continue in both countries until that time .
bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .
romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said he was astonished by the speed with which bulgaria accepted the safeguard clause .

eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .

many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .

brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 russia 's wealthiest man goes on trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters say the kremlin is behind the tycoon 's trial billionaire businessman mikhail khodorkovsky went on trial wednesday for tax evasion and fraud .
critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

the announcement , which was made in frankfurt on wednesday , said the 53-year-old writer had not only redefined the position of his hungarian homeland in the center of europe , but also the position of europe in the center of literature .
born in 1950 , the author belongs to the post-modern generation of hungarian literature .
his main work , ' celestial harmonies ' , which tells the story of his family history , was at the top of the best seller list in hungary for months , and won him several awards .
esterhazy was one of just a handful of authors to begin writing about the absurdities of every day life in a socialist state before the political transition in eastern europe .
he first gained recognition in germany in the mid 1980s , with the publication of ' little hungarian pornography ' , in which he uses anecdotes and fragmented accounts to describe the perversions of daily life in hungary . dw-world.de susan sontag receives german peace prize , criticizes u.s. with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .

an escaped pet kangaroo kept german police in pursuit for several hours before its owner managed to catch it with a giant net . germany 's stormy weather wreaked havoc of a different sort in the western town of limburg , after a thunderstorm knocked out the electric lock on kippy the kangaroo 's cage , setting the marsupial on the loose .
kippy roamed the german countryside for some 24 hours before passers-by spotted him near a motorway and alerted police . the kangaroo led police across meadows and country lanes for four hours before it was captured . kippy survived the adventure intact , thanks in part to the high fences lining the motorway where he was spotted . the fences stopped him from running towards the speeding cars , an instinct that results in the death of many kangaroos in their native australia . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .

" as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . " there is an extraordinary amount of overhead in germany , of uniformed people that have nothing to do with budget , that have everything to do with running installations , guarding installations , managing housing , and all that stuff that counts against our endstrength , " he said .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

an escaped pet kangaroo kept german police in pursuit for several hours before its owner managed to catch it with a giant net . germany 's stormy weather wreaked havoc of a different sort in the western town of limburg , after a thunderstorm knocked out the electric lock on kippy the kangaroo 's cage , setting the marsupial on the loose .
kippy roamed the german countryside for some 24 hours before passers-by spotted him near a motorway and alerted police . the kangaroo led police across meadows and country lanes for four hours before it was captured . kippy survived the adventure intact , thanks in part to the high fences lining the motorway where he was spotted . the fences stopped him from running towards the speeding cars , an instinct that results in the death of many kangaroos in their native australia . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .

the announcement , which was made in frankfurt on wednesday , said the 53-year-old writer had not only redefined the position of his hungarian homeland in the center of europe , but also the position of europe in the center of literature .
born in 1950 , the author belongs to the post-modern generation of hungarian literature .
his main work , ' celestial harmonies ' , which tells the story of his family history , was at the top of the best seller list in hungary for months , and won him several awards .
esterhazy was one of just a handful of authors to begin writing about the absurdities of every day life in a socialist state before the political transition in eastern europe .
he first gained recognition in germany in the mid 1980s , with the publication of ' little hungarian pornography ' , in which he uses anecdotes and fragmented accounts to describe the perversions of daily life in hungary . dw-world.de susan sontag receives german peace prize , criticizes u.s. with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday .

kippy roamed the german countryside for some 24 hours before passers-by spotted him near a motorway and alerted police . the kangaroo led police across meadows and country lanes for four hours before it was captured . kippy survived the adventure intact , thanks in part to the high fences lining the motorway where he was spotted . the fences stopped him from running towards the speeding cars , an instinct that results in the death of many kangaroos in their native australia . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 russia 's wealthiest man goes on trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters say the kremlin is behind the tycoon 's trial billionaire businessman mikhail khodorkovsky went on trial wednesday for tax evasion and fraud .
critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .
" he 's supported by the right-wing left and the left-wing right .

" as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . " there is an extraordinary amount of overhead in germany , of uniformed people that have nothing to do with budget , that have everything to do with running installations , guarding installations , managing housing , and all that stuff that counts against our endstrength , " he said .

both divisions are involved in operations in iraq . schoomaker refrained from providing details of the troop reductions .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "

an escaped pet kangaroo kept german police in pursuit for several hours before its owner managed to catch it with a giant net . germany 's stormy weather wreaked havoc of a different sort in the western town of limburg , after a thunderstorm knocked out the electric lock on kippy the kangaroo 's cage , setting the marsupial on the loose .
kippy roamed the german countryside for some 24 hours before passers-by spotted him near a motorway and alerted police . the kangaroo led police across meadows and country lanes for four hours before it was captured . kippy survived the adventure intact , thanks in part to the high fences lining the motorway where he was spotted . the fences stopped him from running towards the speeding cars , an instinct that results in the death of many kangaroos in their native australia . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .

an escaped pet kangaroo kept german police in pursuit for several hours before its owner managed to catch it with a giant net . germany 's stormy weather wreaked havoc of a different sort in the western town of limburg , after a thunderstorm knocked out the electric lock on kippy the kangaroo 's cage , setting the marsupial on the loose .
kippy roamed the german countryside for some 24 hours before passers-by spotted him near a motorway and alerted police . the kangaroo led police across meadows and country lanes for four hours before it was captured . kippy survived the adventure intact , thanks in part to the high fences lining the motorway where he was spotted . the fences stopped him from running towards the speeding cars , an instinct that results in the death of many kangaroos in their native australia . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

kippy roamed the german countryside for some 24 hours before passers-by spotted him near a motorway and alerted police . the kangaroo led police across meadows and country lanes for four hours before it was captured . kippy survived the adventure intact , thanks in part to the high fences lining the motorway where he was spotted . the fences stopped him from running towards the speeding cars , an instinct that results in the death of many kangaroos in their native australia . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .
" he 's supported by the right-wing left and the left-wing right .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that . " but fischer 's political allies in the european parliament seem to have decided to throw their weight behind juncker as well : " he is the only one that can get a two-thirds majority in parliament , " said daniel cohn-bendit , who served as a french greens european parliamentarian but will now represent germany after the elections .
" he 's supported by the right-wing left and the left-wing right .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

after rumors had been flying for years , it was only a question of time until a senior official confirmed the moves . u.s. army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced tuesday in washington that the united states would reduce its divisions in germany in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments . general schoomaker stressed that the costs to keep troops stationed there were immensely high .
" as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . " there is an extraordinary amount of overhead in germany , of uniformed people that have nothing to do with budget , that have everything to do with running installations , guarding installations , managing housing , and all that stuff that counts against our endstrength , " he said .
" i want to convert those people into something that is usable in uniform . " the united states plans to restructure its armed forces to be better able to respond rapidly to crises throughout the world . german-based troops to be halved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the u.s. army 's v corps , based in heidelberg , march to a welcome back ceremony at the campbell barracks in heidelberg in march after deployment in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc year-long delay possible for future eu members the eu will be able to delay bulgaria and romania from joining the bloc for a year under a new safeguard clause now being proposed .
the clause gives the eu the possibility of delaying entry for a year , if commitments made by candidate countries during negotiations are not met . during a series of meetings between the three sides on tuesday in luxembourg it was confirmed that the two countries would face a tougher monitoring system prior to accession to the union .
romania and bulgaria are expected to become eu members in 2007 , and the reinforced systems are intended to ensure that reforms will continue in both countries until that time .
bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .
romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said he was astonished by the speed with which bulgaria accepted the safeguard clause .
geoana added that it happened " over the weekend . "
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen confirmed that he would make the same proposal for a safeguard clause for romania , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc year-long delay possible for future eu members the eu will be able to delay bulgaria and romania from joining the bloc for a year under a new safeguard clause now being proposed .
the clause gives the eu the possibility of delaying entry for a year , if commitments made by candidate countries during negotiations are not met . during a series of meetings between the three sides on tuesday in luxembourg it was confirmed that the two countries would face a tougher monitoring system prior to accession to the union .
romania and bulgaria are expected to become eu members in 2007 , and the reinforced systems are intended to ensure that reforms will continue in both countries until that time .
bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .
romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said he was astonished by the speed with which bulgaria accepted the safeguard clause .
geoana added that it happened " over the weekend . "
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen confirmed that he would make the same proposal for a safeguard clause for romania , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 russia 's wealthiest man goes on trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters say the kremlin is behind the tycoon 's trial billionaire businessman mikhail khodorkovsky went on trial wednesday for tax evasion and fraud .
critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .

last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

the clause gives the eu the possibility of delaying entry for a year , if commitments made by candidate countries during negotiations are not met . during a series of meetings between the three sides on tuesday in luxembourg it was confirmed that the two countries would face a tougher monitoring system prior to accession to the union .
romania and bulgaria are expected to become eu members in 2007 , and the reinforced systems are intended to ensure that reforms will continue in both countries until that time .
bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy told the press that the safeguard clause is the best solution for both the eu and bulgaria .
he said this meant the eu could ensure that bulgaria keeps its commitments , and bulgaria is sure to be a fully prepared member by the time of the accession .
romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said he was astonished by the speed with which bulgaria accepted the safeguard clause .
geoana added that it happened " over the weekend . "
eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen confirmed that he would make the same proposal for a safeguard clause for romania , too .

eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .

" if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .

many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .

brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2004 bundesbank probed over posh executive villas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are bundesbank chiefs living in taxpayer-supported luxury ?
just weeks after the resignation of its president in an ethics scandal , germany 's central bank has again fallen under the loop for the luxurious homes it provides its top brass . germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , has denied allegations that it provides its board members and top executives with villas and homes using public funds .
media reports this week alleged the bank had provided its top executives with lavish villas built or purchased using taxpayer money .
" the chairman never lived at the expense of taxpayers , " a bundesbank spokesperson said .
earlier this week , germany 's federal audit court confirmed it had opened a routine audit of the bundesbank 's real estate dealings .
bundesbank : they paid rent in a written statement , the bundesbank said that in the past , members of its board were provided with real estate in cases where they were needed for " specific security requirements and duties of representation . "
in 1998 the bundesbank issued a more restrictive policy under which only the president of the bundesbank and his deputy are provided with housing .
and those executives who were provided with housing had to pay the going rent for the area .
but media reports this week disputed that claim , saying the executives were paying cheaper rent than their posh neighbors .
christine scheel , a member of the green party who leads the finance committee of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , said the allegations warranted a fresh look at the laws governing the bundesbank .
speaking to german public radio station deutschlandfunk on wednesday , scheel said the bundestag 's auditing committee should review the federal audit court 's report and then " consider whether we should change the bundesbank law . "
the bundesbank sought to assuage politicians ' concerns , saying its real estate dealings had been justified .
" because there is no official bundesbank residence , the bank in some cases purchased homes or had them built when an official entered into office and did n't have their own home , " a spokesman told the german wire service dpa .
" after leaving office , board members can continue to live in the homes , but they have to keep paying rent . "

a thing of the past ?
the federal audit court has been investigating the bundesbank 's real estate dealings since the beginning of the year , and the current allegations are n't new .
earlier inquiries made by the audit court in the mid-1990s led to criticism that was later addressed by the bundesbank .
the bundesbank spokesman said the current audit is part of a routine examination made by the federal audit court .
according to the bundesbank , the institution currently has 4,700 apartment rentals for its 14,240 employees , with a book value of € 119 million .
these units were assembled as part of an earlier federal government practice of providing housing for employees .
" in the course of its structural reforms , the bundesbank 's board decided to reduce the number of apartments and to divest itself of apartments that were no longer needed . "
in 1998 , responding to earlier criticism from the federal audit court , the bundesbank also reduced the number of executives to whom it made housing available .

just weeks after the resignation of its president in an ethics scandal , germany 's central bank has again fallen under the loop for the luxurious homes it provides its top brass . germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , has denied allegations that it provides its board members and top executives with villas and homes using public funds .
media reports this week alleged the bank had provided its top executives with lavish villas built or purchased using taxpayer money .
" the chairman never lived at the expense of taxpayers , " a bundesbank spokesperson said .
earlier this week , germany 's federal audit court confirmed it had opened a routine audit of the bundesbank 's real estate dealings .
bundesbank : they paid rent in a written statement , the bundesbank said that in the past , members of its board were provided with real estate in cases where they were needed for " specific security requirements and duties of representation . "
in 1998 the bundesbank issued a more restrictive policy under which only the president of the bundesbank and his deputy are provided with housing .
and those executives who were provided with housing had to pay the going rent for the area .
but media reports this week disputed that claim , saying the executives were paying cheaper rent than their posh neighbors .
christine scheel , a member of the green party who leads the finance committee of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , said the allegations warranted a fresh look at the laws governing the bundesbank .
speaking to german public radio station deutschlandfunk on wednesday , scheel said the bundestag 's auditing committee should review the federal audit court 's report and then " consider whether we should change the bundesbank law . "
the bundesbank sought to assuage politicians ' concerns , saying its real estate dealings had been justified .
" because there is no official bundesbank residence , the bank in some cases purchased homes or had them built when an official entered into office and did n't have their own home , " a spokesman told the german wire service dpa .
" after leaving office , board members can continue to live in the homes , but they have to keep paying rent . "

just weeks after the resignation of its president in an ethics scandal , germany 's central bank has again fallen under the loop for the luxurious homes it provides its top brass . germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , has denied allegations that it provides its board members and top executives with villas and homes using public funds .
media reports this week alleged the bank had provided its top executives with lavish villas built or purchased using taxpayer money .
" the chairman never lived at the expense of taxpayers , " a bundesbank spokesperson said .
earlier this week , germany 's federal audit court confirmed it had opened a routine audit of the bundesbank 's real estate dealings .
bundesbank : they paid rent in a written statement , the bundesbank said that in the past , members of its board were provided with real estate in cases where they were needed for " specific security requirements and duties of representation . "
in 1998 the bundesbank issued a more restrictive policy under which only the president of the bundesbank and his deputy are provided with housing .
and those executives who were provided with housing had to pay the going rent for the area .
but media reports this week disputed that claim , saying the executives were paying cheaper rent than their posh neighbors .
christine scheel , a member of the green party who leads the finance committee of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , said the allegations warranted a fresh look at the laws governing the bundesbank .
speaking to german public radio station deutschlandfunk on wednesday , scheel said the bundestag 's auditing committee should review the federal audit court 's report and then " consider whether we should change the bundesbank law . "
the bundesbank sought to assuage politicians ' concerns , saying its real estate dealings had been justified .
" because there is no official bundesbank residence , the bank in some cases purchased homes or had them built when an official entered into office and did n't have their own home , " a spokesman told the german wire service dpa .
" after leaving office , board members can continue to live in the homes , but they have to keep paying rent . "
the spokesman said he was not aware of the number of instances where homes where purchased , and that an internal investigation is currently being carried out .
a thing of the past ?
the federal audit court has been investigating the bundesbank 's real estate dealings since the beginning of the year , and the current allegations are n't new .
earlier inquiries made by the audit court in the mid-1990s led to criticism that was later addressed by the bundesbank .
the bundesbank spokesman said the current audit is part of a routine examination made by the federal audit court .
according to the bundesbank , the institution currently has 4,700 apartment rentals for its 14,240 employees , with a book value of € 119 million .
these units were assembled as part of an earlier federal government practice of providing housing for employees .
" in the course of its structural reforms , the bundesbank 's board decided to reduce the number of apartments and to divest itself of apartments that were no longer needed . "
in 1998 , responding to earlier criticism from the federal audit court , the bundesbank also reduced the number of executives to whom it made housing available .
recently , the bundesbank has come under increased ethics scrutiny following a scandal involving its former president .

after rumors had been flying for years , it was only a question of time until a senior official confirmed the moves . u.s. army chief of staff peter schoomaker announced tuesday in washington that the united states would reduce its divisions in germany in the course of cutting back on cold war deployments . general schoomaker stressed that the costs to keep troops stationed there were immensely high .
" as we redistribute our forces globally we will reduce the amount of divisions in germany , " schoomaker told reporters . " there is an extraordinary amount of overhead in germany , of uniformed people that have nothing to do with budget , that have everything to do with running installations , guarding installations , managing housing , and all that stuff that counts against our endstrength , " he said .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .
" if mr. verhofstadt says he is a candidate , then he would have the support of the german government , " the official added . according to a report in the financial times deutschland , verhofstadt 's prospects of getting the position are improving , especially since french president jacques chirac had previously thrown his support behind the belgian .
chirac has said that verhofstadt would make a " very good " commission president .
however , great britain and spain are decidedly less enthused about the man . a crowded field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- is certainly not the only one in contention . irish prime minister bertie ahern has been mentioned and while he has said he is not an official candidate , he would accept the post if nominated by his fellow heads of state . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel has also made the finalist list in many people 's minds , but his coalition with the right-wing freedom party has sullied his reputation in the minds of some , who say he is not suitable for such a highly visible position . several eu commissioners ' names have also been floated , such as franz fischler , commissioner responsible for agricultural and rural development or chris patten , external relations commissioner . one commissioner who has edged up the list of nominees due to his widely admired intellect and competence is antonio vitorino , 47 , a native of portugal and the eu 's first justice and home affairs commissioner .
many see him as an outside contender to head the european union executive because of his socialist background and lack of prime ministerial experience .
still , he may be too little known outside brussels and his native portugal to get the commission 's top job . conservatives want one of their own emboldened by the results of the european parliament elections , center-right leaders and parliamentarians have claimed the right to pick a candidate of their choosing .
most would choose jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker the problem is that juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , a christian democrat , has said he does not want the job and has repeatedly told his many admirers that he promised voters back home that he would stay put where he is . that has not stopped elmar brok , a conservative german eu parliamentarian , from going to luxembourg to meet his party colleague and try to convince him to change his mind .
brok sees himself as something of a kingmaker , due to his faction 's success in the recent elections . " the candidate must have a majority in parliament and for that reason the council would be well advised to suggest someone who can get a majority , " he said . that kind of attitude does not sit well with joschka fischer , german foreign minister and member of the green party , who questioned the conservatives ' claims to the position . " the right to propose -lrb- a candidate -rrb- lies with the governments in the council , " he said .
" and that 's that .

sources in london say the takeover of the cologne-based music television operator , which is worth € 300 million -lrb- $ 363 million -rrb- , would boost viacom 's market position in europe .
if the move goes ahead as planned , the company , which also controls the competitor music station mtv , would then dominate the music television market in germany .
this is likely to prompt music labels and german television stations to appeal to the cartel authorities .
recently , the saban capital group registered an interest in buying viva .
viva media ag operates the music channel viva , which was launched as competitor to mtv in 1993 .
since its start , viva has made it into 32 million households .

juncker , however , can not be fully ruled out as he may come under pressure from paris and berlin to reconsider his decision .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2004 russia 's wealthiest man goes on trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters say the kremlin is behind the tycoon 's trial billionaire businessman mikhail khodorkovsky went on trial wednesday for tax evasion and fraud .
critics say the former oil company boss is being prosecuted because his political ambitions posed a threat to the kremlin . russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky 's trial was postponed after only a few hours wednesday because one of the defense lawyers fell ill .
no date was set for the trial 's resumption .
khodorkovsky , the former head of yukos oil company , and his close associate and former yukos manager platon lebedev , face seven criminal charges , including tax evasion , fraud and embezzlement . khodorkovsky 's toronto-based lawyer robert amsterdam was convinced his client would be convicted .
" i 'm expecting nothing more than i have seen in the past .
this is a country which destroys its finest company while its senior members languish in jail illegally , " he told journalists .
" the final verdict ?
guilty ! "
amsterdam said . if convicted , khodorkovsky and lebedev , who are both pleading not guilty , could each be sentenced to up to ten years in jail .
khodorkovsky has been held in pre-trial detention since october ; lebedev since july . the case is widely viewed as the most important trial since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
khodorkovsky 's supporters say he has been targeted because he criticized president vladimir putin 's policies and indicated he might run for president in 2008 . putin deflects criticism " as to what concerns the yukos affair and what signal we want to send to society , it 's not us who 's sending the signal but the prosecutor general , " putin said in late may when asked about the case .
the president has indicated that the yukos affair is part of the country 's efforts to fight corruption . the russian authorities are continuing to put pressure on yukos , russia 's largest crude oil producer .
last month , they demanded that the company immediately pay around $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.8 billion -rrb- in unpaid taxes for the year 2000 .
yukos will appeal on friday .
the backpayments could force the company into bankruptcy unless yukos is allowed to sell assets that have been frozen by a court order , russian newspapers quoted a letter from yukos to prime minister mikhail fradkov as saying . commenting on the letter , analysts said it was an indication that " major shareholders are waving the white flag . "
they called the move a " formal capitulation " on the part of the company menatep , through which khodorkovsky and his partners control yukos .
the letter was effectively a prerequisite for an out of court settlement , pundits said . other commentators were less optimistic about the prospect of yukos surviving the onslaught . " i personally do not see any other scenario apart from bankruptcy , " stephen dashevsky , an oil and gas analyst at aton brokerage in moscow told reuters . khodorkovsky commands little sympathy among the russian public , who view the so-called oligarchs - russians who rose to riches when the communist economy was privatized - as thieves . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de khodorkovsky lawyer takes case to germany the defense lawyer for imprisoned russian oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky visited berlin on monday to raise awareness for the case , as his client allegedly stands no chance of receiving a fair trial .

eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .
eu leaders are to decide at a summit this week who will be the next commission president . the rumor mill has gone into overdrive and the recommendations are flying thick .
countries and parties are letting their wishes be known about who they want to head the eu commission . it is an important job , since the brussels-based body proposes european legislation , manages the bloc 's € 100 billion -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- budget and enforces antitrust and trade laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi the help wanted sign is out , since current president romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- is stepping down this fall . the european council , made up of eu heads of state , will decide at a summit on thursday and friday who will head the 25-member commission . germany and france , two of the eu 's heavyweights , are backing belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt -lrb- photo -rrb- as the new top man at the commission , if he decides to seek the job . " if i see things correctly , there is a large group of member states that sees in mr. verhofstadt an excellent candidate - he is a convinced european and also a fighter , " a german official told reporters on condition of anonymity .

the communication from the commission , obtained by the euobserver , assesses the progress of the eu executive in reducing and simplifying the so-called acquis communautaire , the vast body of eu law that runs to over 80,000 pages .
in 2001 , the commission set itself the target of reducing the volume of the acquis by 25 percent - or 22,500 pages - by the end of this year , scrapping obsolete and overlapping passages and limiting the administrative burden on businesses .
but in the new document the commission concludes that " the 25 percent objective is unlikely to be reached by end-2004 . "
the commission says it has encountered " unforeseen problems , " which are " for a large part beyond its control . "

that is the main conclusion of the moon to mars commission , set up by the president in january .
the report will be officially released on wednesday but details have already been emerging .
it describes nasa as a " relic of the apollo age " , and says major changes are needed to fulfil the president 's goals .
mr bush has urged sending humans back to the moon and eventually to mars .
the top priority is to involve the private sector as much as possible , out-sourcing research , development and above all launches - all unmanned launches into earth orbit should be farmed out to private companies , it says .
divided opinion but last year 's inquiry into the explosion of the space shuttle columbia partially blamed too much private sector involvement .
" the reason that we 've had big cost over-runs with the space station , and the reason we lost the columbia shuttle -lsb- can be put down to -rsb- over-reliance on private contractors , " said john pike , a space expert with the research group globalsecurity.org.
" even more reliance on contractors is just going to waste a lot of taxpayers ' money . "
the commission takes the opposite view .
it says that opening the agency 's activities up to competition will lead to more efficient operations , stimulate innovation and encourage the growth of a private space industry - though it believes that manned missions should remain under nasa 's direct control for safety reasons .
nasa will not comment officially until the report is formally released but administrator sean o 'keefe , a bush appointee , has already said he will implement its recommendations .
that means that large parts of the agency will be sold off or closed down , and here scientists are divided .
one prominent astronomer told the bbc it would have serious consequences for space science , while another said researchers would benefit by being liberated from nasa bureaucracy .

local councillors in the south hams have decided to close and dismantle the park in kingsbridge .
the council says the results of an independent study showed the noise from skateboards posed a sound nuisance .
but skaters who helped raise money to build the park three years ago are planning a protest on wednesday against the park 's closure .
there have been a lot of complaints , but they 're from a small minority of residents bob howson , kids with commitment the peaceful demonstration is being organised by kids with commitment , a group of enthusiastic skaters and skateboarders who campaigned and raised thousands of pounds towards the purpose-built skatepark .
the park was fenced off and officially closed on tuesday , leaving youngsters with the problem of where they can skate .
a by-law to outlaw skating on kingsbridge quay was introduced when the park opened in 2001 .
police in kingsbridge say they are preparing for many of the skateboarders to return to the streets and town centre .
kids with commitment has written to ask the help of the duke of york , who described the project as " exemplary " when he officially opened the park .
spokesman bob howson said : " there have been a lot of complaints , but they 're from a small minority of residents .
" we 've tried to reduce the noise .
we 've carried out curious tests and even tried putting foam on the skateboards .
" unfortunately it made them dangerous , because the wheels would n't turn properly . "
bewilderment the skatepark was closed for a period last year and the council installed an acoustic barrier in an attempt to reduce the noise from the concrete park .
one councillor said the rug was being pulled from under the young people 's feet .
mr howson said it was a " sad situation " when a recreational facility in a recreational area is closed down .
" i completely understand that people need peace and quiet , but i live near the park and the noise is no worse than lorries and everyday traffic - that 's modern life .
" these young people are gathering on wednesday to show their anger , sadness and bewilderment at the council 's decision . "
the group says the reason for the protest is to focus councillors ' minds on how the closure of the park will affect the young people and to find an alternative site .
council spokesman john tucker said the council is looking very hard to find a suitable site in a location the young people can reach .

flybe has added a £ 1.50 surcharge to all its flights .
the company says the increase is due to worsening political violence in the middle east .
it claims the violence is endangering oil supplies which in turn has led to an increase in the current cost of aviation fuel .
flybe general manager , ian taylor , says the recent moves to compensate for this by increasing oil production will not have an immediate effect .

the annual census of the swan population on stretches of the river is expected to confirm the fall .
the impact of mink attacks - blamed for a decline last year - is not expected to be as " devastating " this year .
the predictions came from the queen 's swan marker as he announced the dates for this year 's swan upping , the ancient survey of the crown 's swans .
mr barber says swans suffer at the hands of vandals david barber , who will carry out the census with the assistance of swan warden professor christopher perrins , of the university of oxford , said : " we have seen a decline in the number of breeding pairs nesting along the central river thames area this year .
" as with previous years , shooting , vandalism and dog attacks have also contributed to a decrease in numbers .
" the impact of mink attack has not been as devastating as last year when they contributed to a high proportion of overall fatalities .
" mindless shootings of swans and cygnets , often resulting in fatalities , threaten swan numbers and can have devastating consequences . "
mute swans children from local schools are invited to join the uppers this year to learn about swan conservation .
the upping will start on 19 july at sunbury-on-thames , surrey , and will end at abingdon , oxfordshire , on 23 july .
the census dates from the 12th century when the crown claimed ownership of all mute swans .
nowadays , the crown retains the right to ownership on some stretches of the river thames and tributaries .
ownership is shared with the vinters ' and dyers ' companies which were both granted rights by the crown in the 15th century .

everyone taking part was timed from cowley road to oxford train station .
all four cyclists won the challenge , finishing in 10 or 11 minutes , while a unicyclist and a motorised wheelchair user came joint second in 20 minutes .
bus users took 21 minutes , while two car drivers took 26 and 34 minutes - just ahead of the walkers .
those taking part set off at 0815 bst on tuesday .
the cycling campaign for oxford , or cyclox , who organised the event , said the results mirrored last year 's challenge along oxford 's botley road .
they hope to repeat the 2.2-mile cowley road route next year to see whether £ 1m of safety improvements has any effect on the results .
james styring , cyclox co-ordinator and organiser of today 's event , said : " yet again , on a different cross-city route , the bike is quicker than any other form of transport at peak commuting times . "

they say problems began when traffic lights were installed in neighbouring alexandra park road , in muswell hill .
motorists now use the avenue and dukes avenue in north london to avoid them .
haringey council says it is looking at how to tackle the volume of traffic on the roads - also named by transport 2000 as the uk 's second worst rat run .
as well as a poster campaign , residents have strung up a huge banner across the street voicing their concerns .
councillor ray dodds said : " although we are aware of the concerns of some residents there are sadly other roads within the borough which are of a higher risk and which have to be tackled first .
" however , we have been working for several months to find ways of preventing rat runs in this area .
" the council is seeking residents views and consulting with community and residents ' associations on options to do this . "
