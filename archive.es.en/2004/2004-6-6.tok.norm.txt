during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .

ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .

let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .

the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .

peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .

he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .

at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and u.s. president george w. bush review an honor guard upon their arrival at the american cemetery in colleville-sur-mer .
" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .

peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .

european leaders reacted with sadness over the weekend to the death of former united states president ronald reagan , who died of pneumonia on saturday at age 93 in his home in california . political leaders across europe , especially in the former soviet-controlled eastern europe , on sunday eulogized former u.s. president ronald reagan for dedicating his office to fighting to end the cold war .
in a 1987 trip to berlin , he famously sent an unforgettable message to the then-soviet leader mikhail gorbachev .
" mr. gorbachev , " he said , " tear down this wall " !
following his death on saturday after a long battle with alzheimer 's disease that took him out of the public eye a decade ago , european leaders reflected on his achievements .
dw-world has rounded reactions from germany and the rest of europe , including that of gorbachev , who was one of the first to honor the passing of the president .
" i feel great regret .
reagan was a statesman who , despite all disagreements that existed between our countries at the time , displayed foresight and determination to meet our proposals halfway and change our relations for the better , stop the nuclear race , start scrapping nuclear weapons , and arrange normal relations between our countries . " - former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev " he was a stroke of luck for the world .
-lrb- two years after reagan called on gorbachev to tear down the wall , he noted , it fell . -rrb-
two years later the wall fell and 11 months later germany was reunified .
we germans have much to thank ronald reagan for . " - former german chancellor helmut kohl " his commitment to overcome the east-west conflict and his vision of a free and reunified europe helped bring about the conditions that finally made german reunification possible . " - german chancellor gerhard schröder " i was deeply hit by the news about the death of ronald reagan .
he was a man of firm principles who was indisputably instrumental in the fall of communism . " - former czech president vaclav havel " president reagan was one of my closest political and dearest personal friends .
he will be missed not only by those who knew him , and not only by the nation that he served so proudly and loved so deeply , but also by millions of men and women who live in freedom today because of the policies he pursued .
ronald reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the cold war for liberty , and he did it without a shot being fired .
to have achieved so much against so many odds and with such humour and humanity made ronald reagan a truly great american hero . " - former british prime minister margaret thatcher " when he saw injustice , he wanted to do away with it .
he saw communism , and he wanted to put an end to it .
we understood , without saying it , that we were workingin the same direction .
we did not consult with each other , yet each knew that he could count on the other . " - solidarity founder lech walesa " the pope received the news of president reagan 's death with sadness .
two days ago , when he met president bush at the vatican , the pope sent a warm message of best wishes to mrs reagan , knowing that her husband was very sick . " - a spokesman for pope john paul ii " a great statesman who through the strength of his convictions and his commitment to democracy will leave a deep mark in history . " - french president jacques chirac " reagan will be remembered as a good friend of britain.the negotiations of arms control agreements in his second term and his statesmanlike pursuit of more stable relations with the soviet union helped bring about the end of the cold war .
he will be greatly missed by his many friends and admirers on this side of the atlantic . " - british prime minister tony blair " president reagan was a determined opponent of communism and he played an important role in bringing an end to communism and to the artificial division of europe imposed after the second world war .
this process culminated in the accession of ten new member states to the european union at the beginning of may this year .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .
and for that we thank you .
our promise is : we will not forget the victims . gerhard schröder is germany 's chancellor send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .

i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .

today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '

france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .

france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .

they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .

and chancellor gerhard schröder becomes the first german leader to attend the ceremonies , marking the turning point of wwii . united states president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac joined hundreds of veterans in normandy on sunday to remember the tens of thousands of allied soldiers who perished during the d-day landings 60 years ago , which marked the start of the american and british push towards berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and u.s. president george w. bush review an honor guard upon their arrival at the american cemetery in colleville-sur-mer .
" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .
on the day , more than 155,000 allied soldiers landed on five beaches in frances , marking their entry into continental europe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and u.s. president george w. bush review an honor guard upon their arrival at the american cemetery in colleville-sur-mer .
" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .
on the day , more than 155,000 allied soldiers landed on five beaches in frances , marking their entry into continental europe .

many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .

and chancellor gerhard schröder becomes the first german leader to attend the ceremonies , marking the turning point of wwii . united states president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac joined hundreds of veterans in normandy on sunday to remember the tens of thousands of allied soldiers who perished during the d-day landings 60 years ago , which marked the start of the american and british push towards berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and u.s. president george w. bush review an honor guard upon their arrival at the american cemetery in colleville-sur-mer .
" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .
and for that we thank you .
our promise is : we will not forget the victims . gerhard schröder is germany 's chancellor send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .

and chancellor gerhard schröder becomes the first german leader to attend the ceremonies , marking the turning point of wwii . united states president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac joined hundreds of veterans in normandy on sunday to remember the tens of thousands of allied soldiers who perished during the d-day landings 60 years ago , which marked the start of the american and british push towards berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and u.s. president george w. bush review an honor guard upon their arrival at the american cemetery in colleville-sur-mer .
" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .

french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .

it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .

meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .
and for that we thank you .
our promise is : we will not forget the victims . gerhard schröder is germany 's chancellor send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .

" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "

the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .

soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , right , and u.s. president george w. bush review an honor guard upon their arrival at the american cemetery in colleville-sur-mer .
" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .
on the day , more than 155,000 allied soldiers landed on five beaches in frances , marking their entry into continental europe .
eleven months later , hitler and nazi germany capitulated . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering d-day dw-world 's full coverage of the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .
and for that we thank you .

france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .
and for that we thank you .
our promise is : we will not forget the victims . gerhard schröder is germany 's chancellor send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .

and chancellor gerhard schröder becomes the first german leader to attend the ceremonies , marking the turning point of wwii . united states president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac joined hundreds of veterans in normandy on sunday to remember the tens of thousands of allied soldiers who perished during the d-day landings 60 years ago , which marked the start of the american and british push towards berlin .

" france will never forget , " chirac told the crowd at the american military cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , " that 6th of june , 1944 , the day hope was reborn .
it will never forget the men who made the supreme sacrifice to liberate our soil , our native land , our continent , from the yoke of nazi barbarity and its murderous folly . "
he added that america was an " everlasting friend , " and that france would never forget its debt to the country , which helped bring europe together in peace , freedom and democracy .
u.s. president bush also honored the allied veterans in his speech and said that " america would do this again for its friends . "
bush also recalled the fact that former u.s. president ronald reagan , who died in california on saturday , took part in d-day memorial celebrations in 20 years ago in 1984 .
he eulogized reagan as a leader in the fight for freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion .
the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .
on the day , more than 155,000 allied soldiers landed on five beaches in frances , marking their entry into continental europe .

the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

the french-american commemoration in normandy is the first ceremony to take place in the d-day 60th anniversary services .
countless veterans from both sides of the conflict - the allies on one side and germany on the other - gathered at the sun-soaked cemetery .
colleville is located at omaha beach , where more than 3,000 american soldiers fell on a single day of fighting on june 6 .
1944 .
in colleville alone , a total of 9,386 white crosses dot the lawn-covered cemetery , demarking the burial grounds of u.s. soldiers who died in battle here .
a first for schröder more than 24 world leaders are expected to join the main d-day celebration sunday afternoon at arromanches , a city on the english channel located roughly at the mid-point among the major code-named beaches where the day 's biggest battles occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- shares a close political relationship with france 's jacques chirac .
among them will be german chancellor gerhard schröder , marking the first time a german , the former enemy , has taken part in a d-day memorial ceremony .
the chancellor plans to lay two wreathes at the military cemetery in the city of ranville - one for the allies and one for the german soldiers who lost their lives .
soldiers from eight countries are buried at the cemetery , including 322 from germany .
at a franco-german celebration later in the evening , schröder and chirac are both expected to give speeches .
schröder 's historic visit represents the high point of two-generations of reconciliation between germany and the allies .
speaking to germany 's mass-circulation bild am sonntag newspaper , schröder said : " the victory of the allies was not a victory over germany , but a victory for germany . "
schröder said his invitation from chirac to attend the commemorative ceremonies suggested the " postwar era is undeniably over . "
only 10 years ago , the allies refused to invite schröder 's predecessor , helmut kohl , a political leader who helped bring about the end of the cold war , to the 50th anniversary memorial services .
the focus of the ceremony has changed , too .
" i think the focus has to be on joint-remembrance - including joint remembrance of the dead , " he told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
venues stir controversy in germany nonetheless , schröder 's choice of venues drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was a " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
prince charles attends opening ceremonies the offical d-day festivities began on saturday , with 300 british soldiers parachuting near ranville and caen , where brit paratroopers took part in a spectacular landing action on d-day and subsequently seized a strategic bridge .
using both modern and historic warships , a number of british veterans on saturday set sail from the city of portsmouth toward normandy .
meanwhile , in a pomp-filled ceremony in paris , french defense minister michèle alliot-marie and foreign ministry chief michel barnier awarded frances highest medal , the order of the french legion of honor , to 105 d-day veterans .
d-day is remembered as one of the most important events in modern european history .
it 's known here as a milestone in the liberation of europe during world war ii from nazi control .

during his visit to europe this week , u.s. president george w. bush expressed confidence that the compromises reached on a new draft iraq resolution could enable it to be introduced in the united nations within days . in rome and paris this week , bush asked european leaders to support the latest draft iraq resolution , and he appears to have gotten it , too .
french president jacques chirac , one of the toughest critics of washington 's iraq policies said after a one-hour talk with bush on saturday that he was confident that a u.n. resolution could soon be passed .
" i hope that we will manage within a few days to -lrb- agree -rrb- on a resolution which meets what is , in our eyes , essential , which is to give the iraqis the feeling that they have regained their sovereignty and the mastery of their destiny , " chirac said .
in surprisingly harmonious words , chirac also said that he and bushwould seek a common position on the iraq issue , and that the two had conducted a " trusting " and " sincere " talk .
france and the u.s. , he said , share the same values of democracy , peace and human rights .
still much to do chirac described the current situation in iraq as " extremely precarious " and said there was no choice but to restore order in the country .
he also sought to minimize france 's differences with the bush administration .
" well you all know that our countries have had somewhat different approaches and solutions and a vision of the situation which was not similar , " he said .
" that being said , we share one and the same conviction today , namely that there is no alternative to restoring peace and therefore to restoring security and development in iraq and that no effort must be spared in achieving this . "
bush is currently visiting france to participate in celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the allied landing in normandy during world war ii .
upon his departure from rome , where he met with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi one day earlier , bush said he believed the latest draft resolution from the u.s. and britain deserved the " full support of the international community . "
he said he was confident the resolution , which would restore sovereignty to the iraqis , would soon find majority support .
the u.s. and britain released a reworked version of the resolution text on friday night .
the resolution endorses iraq 's new interim government and establishes a multinational force to provide security as the country tries to arrange elections in january .
the resolution also gives the iraqi leadership the right to expel foreign troops from the country .
it states that the mandate for the u.s.-led international force in the country will end when a democratically elected government takes office in baghdad " or earlier if the independent interim government of iraq " so desires .
so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .

so far , the strongest criticism of the new draft has come from russia .
" we can not say that it satisfies us entirely , " said deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov .
" we therefore believe further work is vital to reach agreement . "
the official for russia , which holds veto power as a permanent member of the security council , said it had yet to be determined whether accepting a new resolution would clearly improve conditions in iraq .
" a big catastrophe " both bush and berlusconi said during their visit that american and italian troops should remain in iraq as long as they are needed to ensure security and the building of a democratic nation requires .
" our troops will stay in the country , until the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- government decides otherwise , " the italian prime minister told reporters .
in his first television interview on friday , the newly appointed iraqi interim prime minister , iyad allawi , warned that a premature troop pullout could lead to a " big catastrophe " for his country .
the u.s.-led occupation force , he said , must remain in place until iraq has a functioning security apparatus and a proper army .
parliament to draft constitution under the new resolution , the interim government would take " full responsibility and unlimited authority " for the country after the planned transfer of power on june 30 .
parliamentary elections would then be scheduled sometime between dec .
31 and january 31 , 2005 .
the parliament 's first duty would be to create a constitution that would lead to a constitutionally valid elected government by the end of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi assures bush of italian support in iraq just before visiting one of his sharpest critics , the french president , u.s. president bush received assurances from italian prime minister berlusconi that his country was prepared to stick by the united states in iraq .

european leaders reacted with sadness over the weekend to the death of former united states president ronald reagan , who died of pneumonia on saturday at age 93 in his home in california . political leaders across europe , especially in the former soviet-controlled eastern europe , on sunday eulogized former u.s. president ronald reagan for dedicating his office to fighting to end the cold war .
in a 1987 trip to berlin , he famously sent an unforgettable message to the then-soviet leader mikhail gorbachev .
" mr. gorbachev , " he said , " tear down this wall " !
following his death on saturday after a long battle with alzheimer 's disease that took him out of the public eye a decade ago , european leaders reflected on his achievements .
dw-world has rounded reactions from germany and the rest of europe , including that of gorbachev , who was one of the first to honor the passing of the president .
" i feel great regret .
reagan was a statesman who , despite all disagreements that existed between our countries at the time , displayed foresight and determination to meet our proposals halfway and change our relations for the better , stop the nuclear race , start scrapping nuclear weapons , and arrange normal relations between our countries . " - former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev " he was a stroke of luck for the world .
-lrb- two years after reagan called on gorbachev to tear down the wall , he noted , it fell . -rrb-
two years later the wall fell and 11 months later germany was reunified .
we germans have much to thank ronald reagan for . " - former german chancellor helmut kohl " his commitment to overcome the east-west conflict and his vision of a free and reunified europe helped bring about the conditions that finally made german reunification possible . " - german chancellor gerhard schröder " i was deeply hit by the news about the death of ronald reagan .
he was a man of firm principles who was indisputably instrumental in the fall of communism . " - former czech president vaclav havel " president reagan was one of my closest political and dearest personal friends .
he will be missed not only by those who knew him , and not only by the nation that he served so proudly and loved so deeply , but also by millions of men and women who live in freedom today because of the policies he pursued .
ronald reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the cold war for liberty , and he did it without a shot being fired .
to have achieved so much against so many odds and with such humour and humanity made ronald reagan a truly great american hero . " - former british prime minister margaret thatcher " when he saw injustice , he wanted to do away with it .
he saw communism , and he wanted to put an end to it .
we understood , without saying it , that we were workingin the same direction .
we did not consult with each other , yet each knew that he could count on the other . " - solidarity founder lech walesa " the pope received the news of president reagan 's death with sadness .
two days ago , when he met president bush at the vatican , the pope sent a warm message of best wishes to mrs reagan , knowing that her husband was very sick . " - a spokesman for pope john paul ii " a great statesman who through the strength of his convictions and his commitment to democracy will leave a deep mark in history . " - french president jacques chirac " reagan will be remembered as a good friend of britain.the negotiations of arms control agreements in his second term and his statesmanlike pursuit of more stable relations with the soviet union helped bring about the end of the cold war .
he will be greatly missed by his many friends and admirers on this side of the atlantic . " - british prime minister tony blair " president reagan was a determined opponent of communism and he played an important role in bringing an end to communism and to the artificial division of europe imposed after the second world war .
this process culminated in the accession of ten new member states to the european union at the beginning of may this year .

but they were also the place of military courage to free europe .
france 's memories of june 6 , 1944 are different from germany 's .
but they all end in a common conviction : we want peace .
we in germany know who caused the war .
we know our responsibility for history and we take it seriously .
thousands of allied soldiers died on a single , cruel day .
they paid the highest price for freedom .
german soldiers were killed because they were sent on a murderous drive to oppress europe .
through their deaths , all the soldiers on all fronts were united - in the grief of their parents and wives , of their brothers and sisters and friends .
i remember the citizens of oradour .
they fell victims 60 years ago to the immoral and inhuman waffen-ss .
france and its allies , but also the citizens of the heavily tested town of caen , have a different memory of june 1944 to that of most germans .
for france this historic day marked the start of the long-awaited end to occupation .
for many germans , june 6 symbolized the ultimate military defeat .
others had recognized long before that germany 's moral collapse had started with the national socialist 's violent rule .
against the background of the allied advance , german resistance fighters on july 20 , 1944 , made a failed attack against the dictatorship .
they died for a better germany .
the soldiers ' cemeteries and the scars of both world wars have given the people of europe - especially the germans - an enduring duty to resist racism , anti-semitism and totalitarian ideologies .
our democratic goals are freedom , justice and a worthy life for all - in freedom , without religious hatred , without national arrogance or political indoctrination .
we depend on the legacy of enlightenment , tolerance and the consoling beauty of european culture .
to preserve these aims was and still is the task of june 6 , 1944 .
europe has learned its history , and we germans are not going to supress it .
europe 's citizens and politicians are responsible for ensuring that war-making , war crimes and terrorism have no chance .
ladies and gentlemen , the fall of the hitler dictatorship was the work of the allies in the west and the east .
the millions of victims of the nazis in eastern europe are not forgotten , the men and women of the western alliance are not forgotten , neither are all the russian soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of their homeland .
no-one will ever forget the 12 years of hitler 's rule .
my generation grew up in its shadow .
my family only found the grave of my father , who fell in romania , four years ago .
i never had the chance to get to know my father .
ladies and gentlemen , it is not the old germany of those dark years that i represent here .
my country has found its way back into the circle of civilized communities .
it was a long path to a successful and stable democracy .
the citizens of east germany overturned the communist dictatorship through a peaceful revolution in 1989 , achieved freedom and won unity .
without the hand , which france in its generosity and political wisdom stretched out to us , we would not have found been able to complete the path which led us to reunification .
and for this mr. president i would especially like to thank you for your constant help and commitment .
it is a good day - today on june 6 , 2004 - to thank france and its allies for that .
the fall of the hitler dictatorship needed patriots and soldiers .
because we germans know that , we are not pacifists .
but we are also not prepared to turn lightly to military means .
where a military intervention was and is needed , germany will not shirk from its responsibility for peace and human rights .
ladies and gentlemen , we look in great sorrow on the battlefields of europe .
we are grateful that france and germany today stand closer to each other than ever before .
out of nationalistic madness , the european partnership was born .
let us this day use these memories to further our work for peace .
we want a united , peaceful europe that takes its responsibility for peace and justice on its own continent and in the world seriously .
that is our hope .
there was also hope at the beginning of the german-french friendship .
trust and confidence are today its hallmarks .
what on june 6 , 1944 seemed impossible , became true , because the people of both our countries wanted it so .
i would like to take as an example the fate of a german soldier hans flindt .
he fought in normandy and was captured .
after his release he married a french woman and stayed in this wonderful land .
today the 78-year-old said of june 6 , 1944 ' it was a new , happier beginning for us . '
those who 60 years ago were robbed of this happier life , deserve our remembrance , our deepest respect .
your death was not in vain .
we live in peace and freedom .
and for that we thank you .

a report by the party says cases of mrsa have risen to record levels , but the nhs is still ill-equipped to deal with the problem .
it warns there is a serious lack of isolation rooms in hospitals , and that many have poor washing facilities .
health secretary john reid said tackling mrsa was " a top priority " .
hospital-acquired infections like mrsa -lrb- methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- affect around 100,000 people in england each year , costing £ 1 billion and causing an estimated 5,000 deaths .
mrsa rates have increased from just over 1,000 cases per year in 1996 to over 7,000 last year .
progress the liberal democrat report , published on sunday , follows on from a 2002 report into the issue by the party .
there is no complacency about the issue of mrsa health secretary john reid the latest analysis says there has been little evidence of improvement , and says measures which have been introduced - such as a director of infection control for each hospital - will make little real difference .
the liberal democrat report , compiled by health spokesman paul burstow , says a reduction in the number of hospital beds since 1997 has meant higher levels of bed occupancy , and therefore a higher risk of infection .
it claims many hospitals have inadequate washing facilities , making hand hygiene more difficult to enforce .
handwashing is the prime method of ensuring hospital-acquired infections do not spread between patients .
and it says the nhs only awarded itself 6 out of 10 last year for implementing infection control standards .
the report says there is still no reliable way of determining how many deaths are caused by superbugs each year - even though the death certification process has been changed in a bid to identify cases .
it warns the figures that are available are just " the tip of the iceberg " .
' black mark ' paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , said : " this report is a black mark against the government 's record on nhs hygiene .
" the government 's approach to dealing with superbugs has been one of utter and extreme complacency .
" people go into hospital to get better .
but they are getting sicker because of staff shortages and because infection control is not a high enough priority .
" the government must clean up its act and make progress to stop more lives being lost . "
tim yeo , shadow secretary of state for health and education , said : " as a matter of urgency , real power must be handed back to the nurses in charge of the wards as only they can ensure that standards do not slip . "
health secretary , john reid said : " there is no complacency about the issue of mrsa - i have made it clear that tackling hospital superbugs is one of my top priorities . "
he added : " there are some common sense measures already in place to minimise the spread of mrsa - like staff washing hands properly .
that is why i am keen to see such schemes introduced more widely .
" but we also need to know more about mrsa , its ever-changing nature and why it is on the increase - £ 3m will be spent on research and development into hospital acquired infections .
we are also stepping up our search for a solution which will eradicate the superbug . "

a report by the party says cases of mrsa have risen to record levels , but the nhs is still ill-equipped to deal with the problem .
it warns there is a serious lack of isolation rooms in hospitals , and that many have poor washing facilities .
health secretary john reid said tackling mrsa was " a top priority " .
hospital-acquired infections like mrsa -lrb- methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- affect around 100,000 people in england each year , costing £ 1 billion and causing an estimated 5,000 deaths .
mrsa rates have increased from just over 1,000 cases per year in 1996 to over 7,000 last year .
progress the liberal democrat report , published on sunday , follows on from a 2002 report into the issue by the party .
there is no complacency about the issue of mrsa health secretary john reid the latest analysis says there has been little evidence of improvement , and says measures which have been introduced - such as a director of infection control for each hospital - will make little real difference .
the liberal democrat report , compiled by health spokesman paul burstow , says a reduction in the number of hospital beds since 1997 has meant higher levels of bed occupancy , and therefore a higher risk of infection .
it claims many hospitals have inadequate washing facilities , making hand hygiene more difficult to enforce .
handwashing is the prime method of ensuring hospital-acquired infections do not spread between patients .
and it says the nhs only awarded itself 6 out of 10 last year for implementing infection control standards .
the report says there is still no reliable way of determining how many deaths are caused by superbugs each year - even though the death certification process has been changed in a bid to identify cases .
it warns the figures that are available are just " the tip of the iceberg " .
' black mark ' paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , said : " this report is a black mark against the government 's record on nhs hygiene .
" the government 's approach to dealing with superbugs has been one of utter and extreme complacency .
" people go into hospital to get better .
but they are getting sicker because of staff shortages and because infection control is not a high enough priority .
" the government must clean up its act and make progress to stop more lives being lost . "
tim yeo , shadow secretary of state for health and education , said : " as a matter of urgency , real power must be handed back to the nurses in charge of the wards as only they can ensure that standards do not slip . "
health secretary , john reid said : " there is no complacency about the issue of mrsa - i have made it clear that tackling hospital superbugs is one of my top priorities . "
he added : " there are some common sense measures already in place to minimise the spread of mrsa - like staff washing hands properly .
that is why i am keen to see such schemes introduced more widely .

the study of over 2,000 patients , co-ordinated by university college london , was stopped early because the evidence of benefits was so strong .
the scientists say all type 2 diabetics with at least one risk factor for heart disease should be given the drug .
the study was presented to the american diabetes association congress in orlando , florida .
the research was backed by diabetes uk , the department of health and pfizer uk .
trial aborted the 2,838 people with diabetes studied had no cardiovascular disease , and had relatively low cholesterol levels . "
doctors should now consider all of their patients with diabetes for statin therapy " simon o 'neill , diabetes uk the patients were either given 10mg of the statin atorvastatin a day , or a dummy pill .
it was found , in people taking the statin , cardiovascular illnesses were cut by a third and strokes by 48 % , compared to the other group .
the researchers suggest patients with type 2 diabetes and a cv risk factor would benefit from being prescribed a cholesterol-lowering medicine such as the statin .
professor john betteridge of university college london , who led the research , said : " in this study , patients on atorvastatin experienced major cardiovascular benefits - so much so that the trial was stopped early because it would be unfair to those receiving placebo -lrb- dummy pills -rrb- to continue .
" currently , only patients with diabetes with elevated cholesterol or established heart disease routinely receive statins - but this study shows that even those without cvd or high cholesterol could benefit from cholesterol-lowering . "
policy development simon o 'neill , head of information and education at diabetes uk said : " people with diabetes spend 1.1 million days in hospital in the uk every year .
" two thirds of this time is as a result of cardiovascular disease , much of which could be prevented .
doctors should now consider all of their patients with diabetes for statin therapy . "
a department of health spokeswoman said : " the study findings and the economic evaluation as proposed will inform ongoing work and contribute to the development of health policy in this area .
" findings will also feed into the guidance and guidelines programmes of the national institute of clinical excellence . "

she credited him with having " won the cold war for liberty ... without a shot being fired . "
