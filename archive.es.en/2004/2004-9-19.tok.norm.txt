raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility . " raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2004 schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans have vented their anger against the spd at the polls german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains . voters in brandenburg and saxony handed a sharp rebuke to mainstream parties sunday , giving radical right parties up to 9 percent of the vote and a boost to the former communists , exit polls showed . schröder 's spd lost about six percentage points on its 1999 result in brandenburg , the vast state surrounding berlin in the former east germany , according to exit polls compiled by the zdf and ard public television channels .
however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung . " whoever votes for the extremists is teaching nobody a lesson , " georg braun , head of another trade group told the paper .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .

" raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

but who has ever heard of an entire handball team disappearing ?
that 's exactly what a sri lankan team did when they took part in a sports exchange in bavaria recently . players of the handball team tsv wittislingen in bavaria are said to have wondered about the poor play of their sri lankan opponents two weeks ago during a home match .
many of the sri lankans reportedly did n't even seem familiar with the rules of the game and had difficulty catching the ball .
" they were so awful , " the bavarian players said after the game . the reasons for the shoddy performance became clear a day later after the bavarian hosts waited in vain for their sri lankan guests for breakfast .
the bavarians earlier thought the guests must have lost their way during a jog in the woods .
but a visit to their rooms showed that the 16 alleged top sri lankan handball players and their 8 trainers had other plans . the team had bolted .
all that was to be found were a couple of sport kits , shoes and sweaty t-shirts . a farewell letter thanked the bavarians for their hospitality .
" we 're going to france , " it said . more light has now been shed on the team 's mysterious disappearance .
a taxi driver in wittislingen has told bavarian police that he along with a couple of other taxis were directed to bring the sri lankans to munich 's central railway station . the alleged handball team is now believed to be living covertly in italy , home to several thousand sri lankan refugees who have built a tight community network in recent years .
one of the players , according to the asian- german sports exchange program group that organized the tournament in bavaria , has already conveyed to his family in sri lanka that he is in italy and will soon have a job . while german and italian authorities scratch their heads about the best way out of the mess , reports say that sri lanka officials have confirmed that the country does n't even have a national handball team . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .

several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2004 berlin 's " momarathon " draws to end the new york museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- exhibit in berlin , which has drawn more than a million visitors since it opened in february , draws to a close on sunday with a spectacular firework display . the moma exhibition in berlin is already being talked of in superlatives : the biggest , most successful european art show ever that boasted the longest waiting lines . the show at berlin 's national gallery that has been the sensation of the city 's art scene in the past seven months , draws to an end on sunday night with a spectacular pink firework display and a party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors admire a picasso at berlin 's moma the around 200 art works which include famous canvases such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night " , claude monet 's " the water lilies " and " the dance " by henri matisse will then be transported back to new york , where they will be on display once again starting mid-november following the renovation of the new york museum of modern art . show a phenomenal success organizers of the berlin show are already talking of a phenomenal success , with almost 1.2 million visitors , 70 percent of them tourists to berlin , flocking to glimpse paintings by picasso , modigliani and other 20th century heavyweights , far exceeding original estimates of around 700,000 visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor looks at a piece by artist bradley walker tomlin titled number 20 which is part of the moma in berlin peter raue , initiator of the prestigious exhibition , said the financial costs too had shot beyond earlier expectations of around € 8.5 million to € 10 million .
raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility . " raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility . " raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung . " whoever votes for the extremists is teaching nobody a lesson , " georg braun , head of another trade group told the paper .

but who has ever heard of an entire handball team disappearing ?
that 's exactly what a sri lankan team did when they took part in a sports exchange in bavaria recently . players of the handball team tsv wittislingen in bavaria are said to have wondered about the poor play of their sri lankan opponents two weeks ago during a home match .
many of the sri lankans reportedly did n't even seem familiar with the rules of the game and had difficulty catching the ball .
" they were so awful , " the bavarian players said after the game . the reasons for the shoddy performance became clear a day later after the bavarian hosts waited in vain for their sri lankan guests for breakfast .
the bavarians earlier thought the guests must have lost their way during a jog in the woods .
but a visit to their rooms showed that the 16 alleged top sri lankan handball players and their 8 trainers had other plans . the team had bolted .
all that was to be found were a couple of sport kits , shoes and sweaty t-shirts . a farewell letter thanked the bavarians for their hospitality .
" we 're going to france , " it said . more light has now been shed on the team 's mysterious disappearance .
a taxi driver in wittislingen has told bavarian police that he along with a couple of other taxis were directed to bring the sri lankans to munich 's central railway station . the alleged handball team is now believed to be living covertly in italy , home to several thousand sri lankan refugees who have built a tight community network in recent years .
one of the players , according to the asian- german sports exchange program group that organized the tournament in bavaria , has already conveyed to his family in sri lanka that he is in italy and will soon have a job . while german and italian authorities scratch their heads about the best way out of the mess , reports say that sri lanka officials have confirmed that the country does n't even have a national handball team . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .

several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .

but who has ever heard of an entire handball team disappearing ?
that 's exactly what a sri lankan team did when they took part in a sports exchange in bavaria recently . players of the handball team tsv wittislingen in bavaria are said to have wondered about the poor play of their sri lankan opponents two weeks ago during a home match .
many of the sri lankans reportedly did n't even seem familiar with the rules of the game and had difficulty catching the ball .
" they were so awful , " the bavarian players said after the game . the reasons for the shoddy performance became clear a day later after the bavarian hosts waited in vain for their sri lankan guests for breakfast .
the bavarians earlier thought the guests must have lost their way during a jog in the woods .
but a visit to their rooms showed that the 16 alleged top sri lankan handball players and their 8 trainers had other plans . the team had bolted .
all that was to be found were a couple of sport kits , shoes and sweaty t-shirts . a farewell letter thanked the bavarians for their hospitality .
" we 're going to france , " it said . more light has now been shed on the team 's mysterious disappearance .
a taxi driver in wittislingen has told bavarian police that he along with a couple of other taxis were directed to bring the sri lankans to munich 's central railway station . the alleged handball team is now believed to be living covertly in italy , home to several thousand sri lankan refugees who have built a tight community network in recent years .
one of the players , according to the asian- german sports exchange program group that organized the tournament in bavaria , has already conveyed to his family in sri lanka that he is in italy and will soon have a job . while german and italian authorities scratch their heads about the best way out of the mess , reports say that sri lanka officials have confirmed that the country does n't even have a national handball team . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .

" " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility . " raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility . " raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

that 's exactly what a sri lankan team did when they took part in a sports exchange in bavaria recently . players of the handball team tsv wittislingen in bavaria are said to have wondered about the poor play of their sri lankan opponents two weeks ago during a home match .
many of the sri lankans reportedly did n't even seem familiar with the rules of the game and had difficulty catching the ball .

the bavarians earlier thought the guests must have lost their way during a jog in the woods .
but a visit to their rooms showed that the 16 alleged top sri lankan handball players and their 8 trainers had other plans . the team had bolted .
all that was to be found were a couple of sport kits , shoes and sweaty t-shirts . a farewell letter thanked the bavarians for their hospitality .

a taxi driver in wittislingen has told bavarian police that he along with a couple of other taxis were directed to bring the sri lankans to munich 's central railway station . the alleged handball team is now believed to be living covertly in italy , home to several thousand sri lankan refugees who have built a tight community network in recent years .
one of the players , according to the asian- german sports exchange program group that organized the tournament in bavaria , has already conveyed to his family in sri lanka that he is in italy and will soon have a job . while german and italian authorities scratch their heads about the best way out of the mess , reports say that sri lanka officials have confirmed that the country does n't even have a national handball team . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .

if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2004 schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans have vented their anger against the spd at the polls german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains . voters in brandenburg and saxony handed a sharp rebuke to mainstream parties sunday , giving radical right parties up to 9 percent of the vote and a boost to the former communists , exit polls showed . schröder 's spd lost about six percentage points on its 1999 result in brandenburg , the vast state surrounding berlin in the former east germany , according to exit polls compiled by the zdf and ard public television channels .
however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung . " whoever votes for the extremists is teaching nobody a lesson , " georg braun , head of another trade group told the paper .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2004 schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans have vented their anger against the spd at the polls german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains . voters in brandenburg and saxony handed a sharp rebuke to mainstream parties sunday , giving radical right parties up to 9 percent of the vote and a boost to the former communists , exit polls showed . schröder 's spd lost about six percentage points on its 1999 result in brandenburg , the vast state surrounding berlin in the former east germany , according to exit polls compiled by the zdf and ard public television channels .
however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .

to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .

others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .
" we 've bought coffee and food .
everybody 's come prepared - it 's a nice atmosphere , " art lover hannelore hannuth , 75 , told reuters . jugglers , artists and musicians entertained the crowds as they waited .
one survey showed that 15 percent of the moma visitors had never been to a museum before .
many of them spoke later of moving moments as they lost themselves in the art works . " lots of people visit because they feel they have to have been at moma .
we ca n't deny that , " exhibition project manager andre odier told reuters .
" inside the gallery it is the art which counts .
but outside the building , in the queue and in the city of berlin it is the sense of occasion which is important , " he said .
" that 's why people wait so long , recommend the exhibition to their friends or even make a return visit . " " people want to see moma live " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors in front of claude monet 's " the water lilies " the massive success of the exhibition has also silenced its critics , who had warned before its opening that such a lavish art spectacle would end up being a burden on the city 's art coffers . some also cautioned that the moma show would only serve to cement strained german-us relations while renowned art historian werner spies said he viewed the prominent presence of american art stars of the second half of the 20th century as a " moma plot " and " a testimony of american infallibility . " raue however has dismissed the criticism as " unbelievably polemical " and said the key to the moma 's spectacular success in berlin lay in the fact that " the people want to see moma live - to experience first hand the real paintings and sculptures .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung . " whoever votes for the extremists is teaching nobody a lesson , " georg braun , head of another trade group told the paper .

" those foreign nationals who do not recognize the laws of our state and call on attacks and hate against others from our territory have lost all rights to live in germany , " said körting . berlin daily berliner morgenpost reported that fadi madi , spokesman for the " international movement against american and zionist globalization and supremacy " was deported to his home country of lebanon on saturday evening for his alleged anti-israel and anti-us stance . the paper said madi had been in beirut last week drumming up support for the conference and was confronted by berlin authorities when he returned to the german capital .
federal prosecutors had been investigating madi on suspicion he belonged to a banned organization , the paper said . " struggle against american-zionist hegemony " germany is doing its best to put a stop to the october 1-3 conference , which organizers billed as supporting " the struggle against the american-zionist hegemony and occupation " in the palestinian territories and iraq . their website also calls for resistance to " american and zionist terrorism . " a spokesman for the conference 's organizers refused to comment on the situation . on friday the german government announced it would not provide visas for anyone stating that attending the conference was the purpose of their visit to germany . german interior minister otto schily also said friday he was examining every possibility to prevent the conference taking place , although he added there had been no formal application to hold the event , and no venue has been advertised .
schily said last week that the conference " seems to fall under the heading of justifying terrorist acts " and that we was trying to ban it . berlin authorities have said they can not ban the event unless they have evidence of specific crimes being committed or planned . the simon wiesenthal center , a leading jewish organization , called on germany to ban the congress , saying it was an effort to recruit terror operatives in europe . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police raid islamic school in frankfurt authorities raided the islamic school of a morccan cultural association in frankfurt on sunday , searching for violent and degrading videos , including one allegedly showing a person being decapitated .

but who has ever heard of an entire handball team disappearing ?
that 's exactly what a sri lankan team did when they took part in a sports exchange in bavaria recently . players of the handball team tsv wittislingen in bavaria are said to have wondered about the poor play of their sri lankan opponents two weeks ago during a home match .
many of the sri lankans reportedly did n't even seem familiar with the rules of the game and had difficulty catching the ball .
" they were so awful , " the bavarian players said after the game . the reasons for the shoddy performance became clear a day later after the bavarian hosts waited in vain for their sri lankan guests for breakfast .
the bavarians earlier thought the guests must have lost their way during a jog in the woods .
but a visit to their rooms showed that the 16 alleged top sri lankan handball players and their 8 trainers had other plans . the team had bolted .
all that was to be found were a couple of sport kits , shoes and sweaty t-shirts . a farewell letter thanked the bavarians for their hospitality .
" we 're going to france , " it said . more light has now been shed on the team 's mysterious disappearance .
a taxi driver in wittislingen has told bavarian police that he along with a couple of other taxis were directed to bring the sri lankans to munich 's central railway station . the alleged handball team is now believed to be living covertly in italy , home to several thousand sri lankan refugees who have built a tight community network in recent years .
one of the players , according to the asian- german sports exchange program group that organized the tournament in bavaria , has already conveyed to his family in sri lanka that he is in italy and will soon have a job . while german and italian authorities scratch their heads about the best way out of the mess , reports say that sri lanka officials have confirmed that the country does n't even have a national handball team . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" those foreign nationals who do not recognize the laws of our state and call on attacks and hate against others from our territory have lost all rights to live in germany , " said körting . berlin daily berliner morgenpost reported that fadi madi , spokesman for the " international movement against american and zionist globalization and supremacy " was deported to his home country of lebanon on saturday evening for his alleged anti-israel and anti-us stance . the paper said madi had been in beirut last week drumming up support for the conference and was confronted by berlin authorities when he returned to the german capital .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .

that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .

several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .

raue said the flood of visitors had forced them to install a much larger air conditioning system in the gallery as well as hire extra security personnel .
" we never reckoned with such a massive flood of visitors , " reue said . but the painstaking advertising campaign with the pink-colored posters and slogans such as " the moma is the star " seems to have paid off .
raue said he was " ecstatic " about the result and was " overwhelmed " by the success . long waiting lines the real star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors throng to the ticket counter at the moma there remains little doubt that the long waiting lines , sometimes up to ten hours long , generated as much interest as the works of art themselves .
to accommodate the crowds , the show remained open round the clock for its last four days . television and other media descended on the long queues outside the national gallery to document the readiness of germans to wait for hours to get a chance to view the art works - an unusual scene in a nation famously averse to waiting in an orderly line .
social commentators are even musing that the moma line - which often exceeded a kilometer - had made queuing cool . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang hindl , 30 , und ruta dressler , 19 , from munich lie in their sleeping bags in front of berlin 's national gallery for a chance to get in early at the moma the following day television cameras showed culture-hungry students armed with sleeping bags prepared to spend the night in front of the stark glass and steel national gallery to be the first to get in in the morning .
others seized the opportunity to make some money , with some people offering to stand in line for others , and charging about € 10 an hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2004 schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans have vented their anger against the spd at the polls german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains . voters in brandenburg and saxony handed a sharp rebuke to mainstream parties sunday , giving radical right parties up to 9 percent of the vote and a boost to the former communists , exit polls showed . schröder 's spd lost about six percentage points on its 1999 result in brandenburg , the vast state surrounding berlin in the former east germany , according to exit polls compiled by the zdf and ard public television channels .
however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .
in elections in the western state of saarland two weeks ago , support for schröder 's party plummeted by about a third to 30.8 percent , the lowest there since 1960 . rise of extremism could deter investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is viewed as more radical than other right-wing parties and organizes periodic marches , often joined by skinheads .
ahead of the polls on sunday , fears that the backlash against schröder 's economic reform agenda might bolster far right and left-wing parties in the two states prompted several business leaders to urge voters to stay mainstream .
they warned that a surge in the extremist vote could scare off investors . " for brandenburg and saxony the growing strength of the right radical parties and the pds is almost catastrophic , " anton börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade told the berliner zeitung . " whoever votes for the extremists is teaching nobody a lesson , " georg braun , head of another trade group told the paper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2004 schröder 's social democrats suffer fresh losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans have vented their anger against the spd at the polls german chancellor schröder 's social democrats lost major ground in elections on sunday in two former communist states as parties from the extreme right and far left posted electoral gains . voters in brandenburg and saxony handed a sharp rebuke to mainstream parties sunday , giving radical right parties up to 9 percent of the vote and a boost to the former communists , exit polls showed . schröder 's spd lost about six percentage points on its 1999 result in brandenburg , the vast state surrounding berlin in the former east germany , according to exit polls compiled by the zdf and ard public television channels .
however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .

however , despite the losses , the spd has managed to retain power in the state .
under social democrat premier mathias platzeck , the party has about 32.6 percent of the vote , according to exit polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters in dresden show the cdu and spd candidates its coalition partner , the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also posted losses and took 19.6 percent .
the cdu however lost its position as the second-largest party in the state to the pds , the successors to the former east german communists , which clinched 28.3 percent support .
that 's the best electoral result the pds has acheived in state elections .
dagmar enkelmann , the ex-communist candidate for governor , immediately staked her party 's claim to taking over the state government . the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , which has campaigned on an anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant platform , will remain in the state parliament with support topping the five percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . conservatives to lose absolute majority in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel , leading candidate of the far right npd in saxony , spd support dropped slightly to about 10 percent of the vote .
but the biggest electoral shock was the rise of the neo-fascist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- , which surged to nine percent from just 1.4 percent five years ago . though the spd losses follow a string of electoral setbacks in regional , local and european polls ever since they launched their " agenda 2010 " social and labor market reform package , the bigger losers this time were the christian democrats .
if exit polls are confirmed , the cdu could lose its absolute majority in saxony and have to look for a coalition partner . eastern voters frustrated with spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several thousand people protest against social and labor market reforms in leipzig nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country . that 's because the latest slew of social welfare reforms , that will soon go into effect will have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
several east germans also feel betrayed by the government because 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , wages and pensions in the region are still lower than in western germany . schröder has been calling on germans to accept that their generous welfare system will not function if it is not trimmed and that painful labor market and social reforms are the only way to revive a stagnant economy and lower nagging high unemployment . but so far , voters have responded by punishing the spd at the polls .

the countryside agency is printing open access maps for the whole of england over the next 15 months .
the first ones cover the south east and the lower north west , which includes the peak district , and will be greeted eagerly by ramblers .
but some landowners are worried that incorrect areas will be included and that farmland will be damaged .
any private land considered moor , heath , mountain or downland or registered common land will now be open to walkers .
ramblers groups are jubilant and have called these maps the most exciting development since the creation of national parks after world war ii .
some restrictions but opponents say consultation has been scant , decisions on what constitutes open access land have been bizarre in some cases and the appeals process has been time-consuming and costly .
the new laws do not give people a right to roam anywhere .
areas like gardens and cultivated land are not included and there are restrictions on some areas at certain parts of year . "
i am confident the respect and love walkers have for the countryside will prove that this is a wise , fair and beneficial piece of legislation " nick barrett ramblers association a total of 105,253 hectares of new access land will be opened on sunday - 13,853 in south east england and 91,400 in the lower north west .
other areas will then follow suit .
walkers have turned out to mark the introduction of the countryside and rights of way act .
nick barrett , chief executive of the ramblers association , said : " this is a truly historic day .
these landscapes are as much a part of our national heritage as structures like stonehenge .
" for many , the joy of walking is about getting off the beaten track - everybody in this country now has a right to do just that and i hope people will take the opportunity to discover these beautiful areas for themselves .
" i am confident the respect and love walkers have for the countryside will prove that this is a wise , fair and beneficial piece of legislation . "
the success for ramblers comes after years of lobbying and direct action in an effort to get access .
rambling ' threat ' perhaps the most notable protest was the kinder scout mass trespass in derbyshire in 1932 that saw ramblers in violent clashes with gamekeepers .
but one of the people not taking part in walks marking the start of the right to roam is the rural affairs minister , alun michael .
there were fears he would be targeted by protesters after a pro-hunt group warned the minister that the countryside was now a ' no-go ' area for labour in the wake of the hunting debate .
mr michael said he had withdrawn because he did not want to disrupt the celebrations , but denied the countryside had become a ' no-go ' area for labour ministers .
mr michael , the minister responsible for steering a hunting ban through parliament , had been due to join walkers in the forest of bowland , lancashire , on saturday and at derbyshire bridge in the peak district on sunday .

steve sullivan 's eight-year-old son kieran has been a patient at the neurosurgery unit at morriston hospital in swansea .

he will meet his lawyers next week to discuss taking action .

his father is one of the leaders of the kids come first campaign , set up to fight the closure of the specialist unit .

chief executive stuart fletcher denied morriston 's unit was to close .
" certainly we will be maintaining provision for emergency neurosurgical cases in swansea , " he said .
" it was made quite clear to us the people in west wales were keen to ensure the continuance of local access for children who needed emergency care . "
if the plan is approved by the swansea community health council , it can progress without a decision from the welsh health minister , jane hutt .

bob hall politics show south west the lack of official sites for travellers has caused considerable problems throughout the south west in 2004 .
travellers : moving on ?
in exeter , travellers simply moved from one illegal pitch to another when they were evicted - upsetting local residents and landing the city council with huge clear up and legal costs .
the lack of lawful sites has caused particular problems this summer in exeter .
a convoy of caravans and lorries moved onto council playing fields at pinhoe in july 2004 .
antisocial behaviour it was two weeks before they could be evicted leaving behind 10 tonnes of rubbish .
their presence caused considerable anxiety among residents .
cllr valerie dixon said : " i had a lot of people ringing me up , saying they were very scared .
" they were shooting rabbits and racing on the football pitches .
" they were so antisocial .
they were not what i would call travellers .
" they were people just out to make as much trouble as they could while they were here .
they certainly did that . "
the travellers are believed to have moved up to exeter after being evicted from a recreation area in plymouth .
" they occupied several sites in exeter , staying for around a fortnight and offering hedge cutting , garden repairs and ditching services wherever they went .
each incursion landed the city council with a £ 2,000 bill in clear up and legal costs .
threatening behaviour ?
cllr michael browning said : " the local authority unfortunately has its hands tied to a certain degree .
it has to go through the legal processes .
" there is also the problem that members of our staff have been threatened on occasion by travellers .
" to be blunt , we do not pay them enough to put their lives on the line . "
allegedly , on one occasion a member of staff was told by a traveller in the presence of police ' you put that notice on my vehicle and i 'll kill you . "
the statutory requirement for councils to provide residential sites for gypsies and travellers was repealed 10 years ago .
local authorities have a legal responsibility under the human rights act to consider the health , welfare and education of the travelling community .
up to 3000 travellers are reckoned in to be in devon in any one year .
devon county council says only 200 of those are occupying unauthorised sites .
cllr des schadrick said : " it is a particular problem .
we are spending £ 25 , 000 a month meeting our obligations to travellers and dealing with enforcement .
" at the moment , we are spending far more on enforcement than meeting the education and welfare needs of travellers and i think the balance is probably wrong . "
official transit sites devon county council sees the solution in creating official transit sites and emergency stopping places. funded wholly through the government 's gypsy site refurbishment scheme .
travellers would pay a rent in return for clean water , toilets and electricity .
sadly an official gypsy campsite at tintinhull near yeovil was vandalised by a 100 travellers earlier in 2004 .
tintinhull was one of many places in the south west that became an unofficial stopover for two to three weeks in the summer .
exeter bore the brunt of the illegal occupations .
the city council is calling for new byelaws to evict travellers more quickly - with more co-operation from the police and the local mp .
ben bradshaw said : " the city council has acted quickly in evicting these travellers from illegal sites but it is up to devon county council to provide more official sites for them to go to .
" if there is any way of speeding up the current processes then i can put that to parliament . "
devon county council has been surveying potential areas for transit sites , including haldon hill which has been illegally occupied but that has been rejected on planning grounds .
cllr schadrick said : " clearly , if we had a site available , then they could be moved into one of these sites .
" we have not come to any decision on being site specific .
we are looking at a large number of sites across the county at the moment - but they would be introduced in areas that traveller have traditionally moved into over the years . "
the government 's policy on gypsies and travellers is currently under review .
meanwhile the gypsy council is calling for the duty for local authorities to provide and run sites to be reinstated and for changes to planning laws to ensure land is made available .
