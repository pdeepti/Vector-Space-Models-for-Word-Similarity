the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .

if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .

in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .

the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .

one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .

if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .

in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .

the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.11.2004 spain tackles domestic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic violence is no longer a taboo subject in spain around 100 women are killed by their current or ex-partners in spain each year .
the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .

the algerian government on saturday denied earlier reports that the gropu had been found .
the five have not been heard from since wednesday when they " gave their guide the slip " in the djanet region , 1,700 kilometers -lrb- 1,000 miles -rrb- southeast of the capital , algiers .
tourism minister mohamed seghir kara had allegedly said that the group had been found in tadrart , some 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- east of djanet , " without their guide . "
the daily el khabar said saturday that the tourists had disappeared after parting company with their guide in " mysterious circumstances " in djanet where they were visiting historic sites and oases , and the foreign ministry in berlin had said they were looking into the report .
journalists have compared their disappearance with the abduction in 2003 of 32 european tourists by the extremist salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- .
the tourists were finally released in two groups after several months , during which one woman tourist died of sunstroke in the desert .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de government says sahara hostages shouldn ’ t profit from ordeal the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state .

" " the european central bank and also other central banks should think about doing something themselves , in respect of their independence , " schröder told reporters on the sidelines of a group of 20 meeting of finance chiefs in the german capital . asked whether the united states should try to rein in the dollar 's descent , because the european union had made efforts on easing iraqi debt , the chancellor replied that the two issues could not be linked . " but the euro / dollar evolution is very worrying , " he said .
" the reason for that is clearly the twin deficits in the us and clearly a partnership means that you have to do something about it . " the strength of the euro is weighing on eu exports by making them more expensive , threatening the feeble economic recovery of the 12-state eurozone . us unfair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- questioned the fairness of us suggestions that the eurozone should further pursue economic reforms to stimulate growth and weaken the euro . " it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing , and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " he said . schröder also said that more cooperation with asian countries , particularly with china and japan , was also necessary on exchange rate issues . european policy-makers are concerned that the strength of the euro will undermine europe 's fragile , export-led economic recovery , but central bankers have so far shown little inclination to intervene in currency markets to halt the dollar 's slide . a source close to the german government said saturday that none of the participants at the meeting had declared support for intervention in the forex markets . the euro rose to a record high of $ 1.3074 wednesday .
it neared that high again friday after us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that the size of the us deficits will put investors off dollar-denominated assets . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel : paris club to forgive most iraqi debt german finance minister hans eichel said on saturday that the paris club had reached a framework agreement to forgive 80 percent of iraqi debt .

the algerian government on saturday denied earlier reports that the gropu had been found .
the five have not been heard from since wednesday when they " gave their guide the slip " in the djanet region , 1,700 kilometers -lrb- 1,000 miles -rrb- southeast of the capital , algiers .
tourism minister mohamed seghir kara had allegedly said that the group had been found in tadrart , some 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- east of djanet , " without their guide . "
the daily el khabar said saturday that the tourists had disappeared after parting company with their guide in " mysterious circumstances " in djanet where they were visiting historic sites and oases , and the foreign ministry in berlin had said they were looking into the report .
journalists have compared their disappearance with the abduction in 2003 of 32 european tourists by the extremist salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- .
the tourists were finally released in two groups after several months , during which one woman tourist died of sunstroke in the desert .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de government says sahara hostages shouldn ’ t profit from ordeal the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.11.2004 spain tackles domestic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic violence is no longer a taboo subject in spain around 100 women are killed by their current or ex-partners in spain each year .
the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in berlin in 2003 he said that the state had to insist on the fact that " our willingness to integrate corresponds to a willingness to be integrated on the part of those who come here . " in his speech , to be delivered later on saturday when berlin 's jewish museum offers a tolerance prize to former president johannes rau , schröder emphasized the importance for foreigners living in germany to learn the language . " without linguistic abilities , no integration and no dialogue can take place , " he said . unfair treatment ? calling on german leaders to promote active participation of foreigners in local government and volunteer organizations , sigmar gabriel , a former social democratic premier of the northern german state of lower saxony , said the state should also push for more immigrants in the country 's police force .

but turkey 's ambassador to germany , mehmet ali irtemcelik , told focus newsmagazine that it was unfair to put germany 's muslim community in the dock .
saying that only 3 to 4 percent of turks living in germany were islamic radicals , irtemcelik called on politicians to work with millions of his countrymen willing to integrate themselves into german society . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.11.2004 germany 's soccer diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in countries with little else , soccer brings hope and a community spirit germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .
a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in berlin in 2003 he said that the state had to insist on the fact that " our willingness to integrate corresponds to a willingness to be integrated on the part of those who come here . " in his speech , to be delivered later on saturday when berlin 's jewish museum offers a tolerance prize to former president johannes rau , schröder emphasized the importance for foreigners living in germany to learn the language . " without linguistic abilities , no integration and no dialogue can take place , " he said . unfair treatment ? calling on german leaders to promote active participation of foreigners in local government and volunteer organizations , sigmar gabriel , a former social democratic premier of the northern german state of lower saxony , said the state should also push for more immigrants in the country 's police force . " the state has to say : we need you , " gabriel said . german politicians have been debating the integration of the country 's estimated three million muslims following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh by a suspected islamic extremist on nov .

but turkey 's ambassador to germany , mehmet ali irtemcelik , told focus newsmagazine that it was unfair to put germany 's muslim community in the dock .
saying that only 3 to 4 percent of turks living in germany were islamic radicals , irtemcelik called on politicians to work with millions of his countrymen willing to integrate themselves into german society . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

" " the european central bank and also other central banks should think about doing something themselves , in respect of their independence , " schröder told reporters on the sidelines of a group of 20 meeting of finance chiefs in the german capital . asked whether the united states should try to rein in the dollar 's descent , because the european union had made efforts on easing iraqi debt , the chancellor replied that the two issues could not be linked . " but the euro / dollar evolution is very worrying , " he said .
" the reason for that is clearly the twin deficits in the us and clearly a partnership means that you have to do something about it . " the strength of the euro is weighing on eu exports by making them more expensive , threatening the feeble economic recovery of the 12-state eurozone . us unfair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- questioned the fairness of us suggestions that the eurozone should further pursue economic reforms to stimulate growth and weaken the euro . " it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing , and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " he said . schröder also said that more cooperation with asian countries , particularly with china and japan , was also necessary on exchange rate issues . european policy-makers are concerned that the strength of the euro will undermine europe 's fragile , export-led economic recovery , but central bankers have so far shown little inclination to intervene in currency markets to halt the dollar 's slide . a source close to the german government said saturday that none of the participants at the meeting had declared support for intervention in the forex markets . the euro rose to a record high of $ 1.3074 wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.11.2004 germany 's soccer diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in countries with little else , soccer brings hope and a community spirit germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .
a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls . " the afghan project will be a long development process , stärk said , but the next steps are already being planned . " we have had conversations with the dfb to bring a german national player to kabul , to lead courses , to organize tournaments … but above all we must continue to be very careful in both the political and religious sectors , " he said . if everything goes to plan , german world champion sylvia neid could be the first female soccer expert to work in kabul . hanspeter detmer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in berlin in 2003 he said that the state had to insist on the fact that " our willingness to integrate corresponds to a willingness to be integrated on the part of those who come here . " in his speech , to be delivered later on saturday when berlin 's jewish museum offers a tolerance prize to former president johannes rau , schröder emphasized the importance for foreigners living in germany to learn the language . " without linguistic abilities , no integration and no dialogue can take place , " he said . unfair treatment ? calling on german leaders to promote active participation of foreigners in local government and volunteer organizations , sigmar gabriel , a former social democratic premier of the northern german state of lower saxony , said the state should also push for more immigrants in the country 's police force . " the state has to say : we need you , " gabriel said . german politicians have been debating the integration of the country 's estimated three million muslims following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh by a suspected islamic extremist on nov .

but turkey 's ambassador to germany , mehmet ali irtemcelik , told focus newsmagazine that it was unfair to put germany 's muslim community in the dock .
saying that only 3 to 4 percent of turks living in germany were islamic radicals , irtemcelik called on politicians to work with millions of his countrymen willing to integrate themselves into german society . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .

" we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .

" " the european central bank and also other central banks should think about doing something themselves , in respect of their independence , " schröder told reporters on the sidelines of a group of 20 meeting of finance chiefs in the german capital . asked whether the united states should try to rein in the dollar 's descent , because the european union had made efforts on easing iraqi debt , the chancellor replied that the two issues could not be linked . " but the euro / dollar evolution is very worrying , " he said .
" the reason for that is clearly the twin deficits in the us and clearly a partnership means that you have to do something about it . " the strength of the euro is weighing on eu exports by making them more expensive , threatening the feeble economic recovery of the 12-state eurozone . us unfair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- questioned the fairness of us suggestions that the eurozone should further pursue economic reforms to stimulate growth and weaken the euro . " it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing , and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " he said . schröder also said that more cooperation with asian countries , particularly with china and japan , was also necessary on exchange rate issues . european policy-makers are concerned that the strength of the euro will undermine europe 's fragile , export-led economic recovery , but central bankers have so far shown little inclination to intervene in currency markets to halt the dollar 's slide . a source close to the german government said saturday that none of the participants at the meeting had declared support for intervention in the forex markets . the euro rose to a record high of $ 1.3074 wednesday .

" the reason for that is clearly the twin deficits in the us and clearly a partnership means that you have to do something about it .

" it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing , and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " he said . schröder also said that more cooperation with asian countries , particularly with china and japan , was also necessary on exchange rate issues . european policy-makers are concerned that the strength of the euro will undermine europe 's fragile , export-led economic recovery , but central bankers have so far shown little inclination to intervene in currency markets to halt the dollar 's slide . a source close to the german government said saturday that none of the participants at the meeting had declared support for intervention in the forex markets . the euro rose to a record high of $ 1.3074 wednesday .

one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .

the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .

in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for .

" " the european central bank and also other central banks should think about doing something themselves , in respect of their independence , " schröder told reporters on the sidelines of a group of 20 meeting of finance chiefs in the german capital . asked whether the united states should try to rein in the dollar 's descent , because the european union had made efforts on easing iraqi debt , the chancellor replied that the two issues could not be linked . " but the euro / dollar evolution is very worrying , " he said .
" the reason for that is clearly the twin deficits in the us and clearly a partnership means that you have to do something about it . " the strength of the euro is weighing on eu exports by making them more expensive , threatening the feeble economic recovery of the 12-state eurozone . us unfair ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- questioned the fairness of us suggestions that the eurozone should further pursue economic reforms to stimulate growth and weaken the euro . " it 's difficult to ask europeans to implement structural reforms - which they are already doing , and at the same time not put a lot of focus on its own economic issues , " he said . schröder also said that more cooperation with asian countries , particularly with china and japan , was also necessary on exchange rate issues . european policy-makers are concerned that the strength of the euro will undermine europe 's fragile , export-led economic recovery , but central bankers have so far shown little inclination to intervene in currency markets to halt the dollar 's slide . a source close to the german government said saturday that none of the participants at the meeting had declared support for intervention in the forex markets . the euro rose to a record high of $ 1.3074 wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.11.2004 germany 's soccer diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in countries with little else , soccer brings hope and a community spirit germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .
a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls . " the afghan project will be a long development process , stärk said , but the next steps are already being planned . " we have had conversations with the dfb to bring a german national player to kabul , to lead courses , to organize tournaments … but above all we must continue to be very careful in both the political and religious sectors , " he said . if everything goes to plan , german world champion sylvia neid could be the first female soccer expert to work in kabul . hanspeter detmer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .

in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in berlin in 2003 he said that the state had to insist on the fact that " our willingness to integrate corresponds to a willingness to be integrated on the part of those who come here . " in his speech , to be delivered later on saturday when berlin 's jewish museum offers a tolerance prize to former president johannes rau , schröder emphasized the importance for foreigners living in germany to learn the language . " without linguistic abilities , no integration and no dialogue can take place , " he said . unfair treatment ? calling on german leaders to promote active participation of foreigners in local government and volunteer organizations , sigmar gabriel , a former social democratic premier of the northern german state of lower saxony , said the state should also push for more immigrants in the country 's police force . " the state has to say : we need you , " gabriel said . german politicians have been debating the integration of the country 's estimated three million muslims following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh by a suspected islamic extremist on nov .
2 and the resulting tension and violence in the neighboring country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three men outside a turkish store in berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood .
but turkey 's ambassador to germany , mehmet ali irtemcelik , told focus newsmagazine that it was unfair to put germany 's muslim community in the dock .
saying that only 3 to 4 percent of turks living in germany were islamic radicals , irtemcelik called on politicians to work with millions of his countrymen willing to integrate themselves into german society . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

" mercosur is strategically important for europe just as europe is also important for the countries of mercosur , " fischer said . fischer said he had told brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and foreign minister celso amorim in talks thursday " that the eu is still interested in an ambitious treaty .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .

" we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.11.2004 spain tackles domestic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic violence is no longer a taboo subject in spain around 100 women are killed by their current or ex-partners in spain each year .
the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .

the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.11.2004 spain tackles domestic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic violence is no longer a taboo subject in spain around 100 women are killed by their current or ex-partners in spain each year .
the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls . " the afghan project will be a long development process , stärk said , but the next steps are already being planned . " we have had conversations with the dfb to bring a german national player to kabul , to lead courses , to organize tournaments … but above all we must continue to be very careful in both the political and religious sectors , " he said . if everything goes to plan , german world champion sylvia neid could be the first female soccer expert to work in kabul . hanspeter detmer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.11.2004 spain tackles domestic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic violence is no longer a taboo subject in spain around 100 women are killed by their current or ex-partners in spain each year .
the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .

the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .

france , germany and russia had agreed to halve iraq 's debt , while the united states and britain , whose troops went to war to oust saddam hussein in 2003 and still remain in the country , are seeking a 95 percent reduction . french finance minister nicolas sarkozy has argued that before agreeing to a reduction of more than 50 percent there must be time to evaluate the overall iraqi situation , the price of oil and iraq 's production capacities . french presidential spokesman jerome bonnafont this week said the time had come to make a " significant gesture " toward iraq but added that paris believed " it is necessary that this gesture remain proportional with what is being done for the world 's poorest countries . " he said iraq 's other creditors should make similar moves to ensure that the debt relief initiative contributes to iraq 's reconstruction . debt to other countries iraq 's debt to other countries , in particular its gulf arab neighbors and former soviet-bloc states such as bulgaria and romania , amounts to about $ 60 billion . private creditors such as banks and infrastructure suppliers hold 20 to 30 billion dollars of iraqi debt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo imf the international monetary fund last october approved a loan to iraq of $ 436 million as emergency assistance to countries emerging from conflict , a step seen as essential to further talks on debt easing . allawi calls for german assistance iraqi premier ayad allawi on saturday meanwhile called on german businesses to help rebuild his country , according to reuters news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister ayad allawi writing a guest column for the german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag , allawi -lrb- photo -rrb- added that his country was not asking for german troops to come to iraq but appreciated the german effort to help train iraqi soldiers in the united arab emirates . the german government has rejected the possibility of german soldiers being stationed in iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq dominates eu summit the eu answered an appeal by iraq 's interim leader on friday by pledging new funds to support iraqi elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.11.2004 germany 's soccer diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in countries with little else , soccer brings hope and a community spirit germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .
a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .

a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .

" but the -lrb- european -rrb- commission must also be able to expect flexibility from our partners in mercosur . " meeting in early 2005 talks stalled in lisbon in october between the then european commissioners for farming and trade , franz fischler and pascal lamy , and the foreign ministers of mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay . a ministerial meeting is now planned for early 2005 to reach an agreement that would create a free-trade zone affecting a population of more than 650 million and boost mercosur 's bargaining position with the united states in talks to create a free trade area of the americas . the eu-mercosur talks , which have dragged on for five years , have stumbled due to differences over agricultural trade barriers and the opening up of government procurement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercosur logo mercosur , which also includes bolivia and chile as associate members , wants better access to european markets for its agricultural goods , especially beef . the eu for its part wants a sweetened deal in the investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking . german wants resolution in doha talks fischer also stressed germany 's interest in a resolution to the doha round of talks in the world trade organization . " we must make decisive progress in opening worldwide markets by the ministerial conference in december 2005 in hong kong , " he said .

german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls . " the afghan project will be a long development process , stärk said , but the next steps are already being planned . " we have had conversations with the dfb to bring a german national player to kabul , to lead courses , to organize tournaments … but above all we must continue to be very careful in both the political and religious sectors , " he said . if everything goes to plan , german world champion sylvia neid could be the first female soccer expert to work in kabul . hanspeter detmer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.11.2004 germany 's soccer diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in countries with little else , soccer brings hope and a community spirit germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .
a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls . " the afghan project will be a long development process , stärk said , but the next steps are already being planned . " we have had conversations with the dfb to bring a german national player to kabul , to lead courses , to organize tournaments … but above all we must continue to be very careful in both the political and religious sectors , " he said . if everything goes to plan , german world champion sylvia neid could be the first female soccer expert to work in kabul . hanspeter detmer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

" he said iraq 's other creditors should make similar moves to ensure that the debt relief initiative contributes to iraq 's reconstruction . debt to other countries iraq 's debt to other countries , in particular its gulf arab neighbors and former soviet-bloc states such as bulgaria and romania , amounts to about $ 60 billion . private creditors such as banks and infrastructure suppliers hold 20 to 30 billion dollars of iraqi debt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo imf the international monetary fund last october approved a loan to iraq of $ 436 million as emergency assistance to countries emerging from conflict , a step seen as essential to further talks on debt easing . allawi calls for german assistance iraqi premier ayad allawi on saturday meanwhile called on german businesses to help rebuild his country , according to reuters news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister ayad allawi writing a guest column for the german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag , allawi -lrb- photo -rrb- added that his country was not asking for german troops to come to iraq but appreciated the german effort to help train iraqi soldiers in the united arab emirates . the german government has rejected the possibility of german soldiers being stationed in iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq dominates eu summit the eu answered an appeal by iraq 's interim leader on friday by pledging new funds to support iraqi elections .

the spanish authorities have recently cracked down on domestic crime with increased awareness , new laws and soon electronic tagging . jose luis rodriguez zapatero tapped into public sentiment when , just hours after being sworn in as spain 's new prime minister , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the march 11 bomb attacks who were in the same ward . in spain , at least one woman dies every week at the hands of her partner .
though certainly not the only country with a domestic violence problem , the difference between it and germany or britain is that the spanish authorities are making a strong effort to prevent such crimes .
one of zapatero 's first acts in office was to bring in new domestic violence laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero one of the main problems combating domestic violence in spain has been the long time lag from when a woman denounces her partner and requests protection , to when she actually gets protection .
in fact , most deaths had been occurring while the woman waited for the authorities to act . now , once a woman makes a phone call reporting her attacker , the police act immediately to protect her with specialist domestic violence teams , alfredo prada presa , vice president of madrid 's regional government , told dw-radio .
a judge can also place a restraining order on the man within a day .
all the elements of the system necessary to help - police , social services , the judiciary - are geared up to work much more quickly and effectively . zero tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting early next year , judges in madrid will have an additional option : as part of what the regional government calls a " zero tolerance " approach towards domestic violence , an electronic tagging system is being introduced . this is the first time there 's every been a preventative warning device like this , prada presa said . the aggressor is compelled to wear a plastic watch-like gadget .
if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .
there are still issues to deal with , but the experts are confident that spain is making considerable progress . danny wood -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women often victims of domestic violence every fourth woman in germany has been sexually or physically assaulted by her partner , according to a government-sponsored study released tuesday .

if he comes within 500 meters -lrb- around 550 yards -rrb- of his intended victim , she hears the alarm on a handset similar to a mobile phone .
simultaneously the emergency services receive a signal that locates the victim and the aggressor . the expectation is that the electronic tags will save many lives , since at the critical moment the woman will be warned and the emergency services will be able to act , prada presa said . still , madrid 's regional government wants more done , like enforcing heavier sentences on the men who commit these crimes and making changes to the penal code to ensure psychological harm to a victim - not just physical harm - counts more in sentencing . politicians have a responsibility to raise awareness among the judiciary and doctors , prada presa said , adding that awareness of the problem was indeed increasing .
medical staff overwhelmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but psychiatrist and psychotherapist francisco orengo , who works with women who are victims of domestic violence , said the changes to the law had n't led to a decrease in the number of people coming to see him .
they have had a different affect , he said . " where we have already seen the impact is in the refuge houses . now women can stay at home and the batterer is supposed to leave , the repercussion of this law is that the woman are staying at home and do n't need to go to the refuge centers , " orengo said . the other issue is getting help to the women who do n't report the problem .
in their cases , it 's essential that the general practitioners and nurses who treat their physical injuries are aware of the problem and know what signs to look for . " the highest problem is that the people who get more patients are the general practitioners and nurses , and they are really overloaded to levels you can not imagine , " orengo said .
" many women simply do n't get treatment because they are too scared to come forward or are n't noticed by a general practitioner , " he added . orengo said gps need to given more resources .
he also called for more solidarity groups that create environments where women feel they can come forward and report the crime .
one-side focus ? the other side is the men . " men 's treatment is really the missed issue here , " orengo said .
" the breakthrough that we have seen in relation to the treatment of domestic violence in women is yet to come in men . there is a directorate for women 's affairs - a directorate for men 's affairs should also be created . " at the moment , there does n't seem to be any real reduction in the number of women dying at the hands of violent men . every day , in spain 's capital alone , judges issue four protection orders to protect women from violent men .
but reporting the crime is on the increase and more and more women are getting treatment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.11.2004 germany 's soccer diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in countries with little else , soccer brings hope and a community spirit germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .
a recent conference has looked at current and future projects abroad where soccer could be used as a diplomatic and regenerating tool . sport in general , and specifically soccer , has long been considered a great tool for diplomacy - something that has not been lost on the german foreign ministry , which invited 22 german coaches to leipzig for a conference supported by the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german olympic committee to discuss new ways of expanding this theme . " just like sport in general , soccer coaches are generally a central element in the creation of understanding between nations in this area , " said peter dettmar , a leading foreign ministry advocate of diplomacy through sport , at the conference .
" these football teachers firstly represent german sport , then german football and finally germany as a whole . " dettmar 's idea is nothing new .
sports personalities have been used as ambassadors for as long as competitive sport has taken place between nations .
but it is an idea that is frequently interpreted and applied in different ways . the meeting of the 22 coaches , most of whom are based in asia and africa , concentrated on promoting germany in the sporting world ahead of the 2006 world cup .
and it also looked into strengthening international ties through sports and the mutual benefits that arise . horst schmidt , vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup , spoke of the give and take needed in dealing with foreign sports federations .
it is no secret , he said , that the dfb has been working increasingly closely with the asian federations and developing a close relationship , without which the world cup may not have been delivered to germany . " the asians gave us their voice in the executive committee of -lrb- world soccer body -rrb- fifa .
we wanted to be appreciative of that and have strengthened our efforts in terms of cooperation . " as part of this cooperation , the german national team will play three internationals in the middle of december , against japan , south korea and thailand . asian relations a current priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb is involved in numerous projects in asia designed to help develop the game and the structures that support it .
german coach thomas flath has been working with the asian football confederation in kuala lumpur for two years , consulting on issues such as organizational structures and the development of youth soccer . flath could be an exception in the future : his two-year stint in malaysia could be one of the last long term positions if the german foreign ministry goes ahead with its plan to increase the number of projects in the world but reduce their duration to no more than eight weeks . lack of continuity hinders africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while asia remains a focus for the foreign ministry and dfb , africa limps behind in terms of the number of projects .
the german institutions have found it harder to establish a relationship with the african federations because of the high staff turnover in most of them , meaning that representatives do n't stay in the jobs long enough to see through the work .
the lack of continuity seems to be the biggest stumbling block . the latest example of this came during the week after cameroon lost to germany in a friendly in leipzig .
the 3-0 defeat heralded the end of coach winfried schäfer 's three-year tenure over the team and effectively ended the rebuilding work that had brought one african cup and world cup qualification in 2002 to the indominatable lions .
a new coach is expected to start from scratch with the team , which would again set collaborations with germany back to square one . chinese cooperation at a peak in contrast , sporting relations with china are at a peak .
under the management of experienced coach eckhard krautzun , a talent school has been built up in bad kissingen where promising chinese players train with their sights on a successful olympic tournament in beijing in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches also work in china and help in developing players and liaising with the german bundesliga , promoting talent that may suit the top clubs in germany . germany is not only a shining light in the promotion of the men 's game .
germany 's women are the reigning world champions and olympic bronze medallists and , as a result , germany holds a respected position in the promotion of the women 's game around the world . problematic promotion of women 's projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's no simple matter to travel to some areas of the world where women hold a different position in culture and society and promote sports diplomacy through women 's soccer , according to hans georg moldenhauer , vice president of the dfb . " we can not simply go , for example , to teheran or , for example , indonesia , and begin a women 's football project , " he said .
" maybe they do not want this at all . " but women 's soccer can have as regenerating an effect as male-based projects , given the right environment .
in afghanistan , for example , where women were persecuted under the taliban regime , german projects have helped a social reshaping process in the wake of the fall of the dictatorship . small successes in afghanistan klaus stärk , a counselor who works with the afghan football association in kabul , has watched a transformation take place . " the girls have a surprising interest in the sport .
we have made the first steps in afghanistan , " he said .
" we have organized one women 's tournament in the stadium , although not for viewing by the general public , but this was the first time they had come out from behind their walls . " the afghan project will be a long development process , stärk said , but the next steps are already being planned . " we have had conversations with the dfb to bring a german national player to kabul , to lead courses , to organize tournaments … but above all we must continue to be very careful in both the political and religious sectors , " he said . if everything goes to plan , german world champion sylvia neid could be the first female soccer expert to work in kabul . hanspeter detmer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values . speaking at his party 's convention in munich , bavarian premier and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber demanded a clear commitment from immigrants to the basic values of german society . " yes to openness and tolerance , no to islamist head scarves , " stoiber told delegates , who unanimously voted against a turkish eu membership and for cutting social welfare benefits for foreigners who are unwilling to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called on young germans to reclaim " traditional german values " such as a willingness to perform , discipline , punctuality , a sense of duty and politeness , received backing from several other conservative leaders . a german leading culture ? in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , rehashed demands for a so-called german leitkultur , or leading culture , which had been at the center of a heated debate several years ago . " anyone who comes here has to accept the german leading culture , " said schönbohm -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , a member of the csu 's sister party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he added that germans share a common language , values and laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we can not allow foreigners to destroy this common basis , " he said .
conservatives should also pay more attention to patriotism and christian values to prevent voters from shifting to right-wing extremist parties as happened in recent state elections , he added . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein agreed with schönbohm 's calls for a leading culture . " multi-culturalism , as propagated by the red-green -lrb- german government -rrb- for years , has proven to be illusionary , " he said . schröder warns of " conflict of cultures " german chancellor gerhard schröder meanwhile also called on muslims to better integrate themselves in german society . schröder warned of a " conflict of cultures " and said muslims " must clearly and without misunderstanding demonstrate that they accept our legal order and democratic rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in berlin in 2003 he said that the state had to insist on the fact that " our willingness to integrate corresponds to a willingness to be integrated on the part of those who come here . " in his speech , to be delivered later on saturday when berlin 's jewish museum offers a tolerance prize to former president johannes rau , schröder emphasized the importance for foreigners living in germany to learn the language . " without linguistic abilities , no integration and no dialogue can take place , " he said . unfair treatment ? calling on german leaders to promote active participation of foreigners in local government and volunteer organizations , sigmar gabriel , a former social democratic premier of the northern german state of lower saxony , said the state should also push for more immigrants in the country 's police force . " the state has to say : we need you , " gabriel said . german politicians have been debating the integration of the country 's estimated three million muslims following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh by a suspected islamic extremist on nov .

but turkey 's ambassador to germany , mehmet ali irtemcelik , told focus newsmagazine that it was unfair to put germany 's muslim community in the dock .
saying that only 3 to 4 percent of turks living in germany were islamic radicals , irtemcelik called on politicians to work with millions of his countrymen willing to integrate themselves into german society . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

the annual telethon celebrated its anniversary with hundreds of events throughout the uk to raise money for disadvantaged children .
in one event , a bbc radio dj broke the world record for the longest on-air marathon , more than 100 hours .
newsreaders natasha kaplinsky , sophie raworth and fiona bruce performed as bananarama in another highlight .
pop stars including girls aloud , westlife , and daniel and natasha bedingfield also performed songs . "
the whole country comes together and says this is a cause worth supporting " tony blair the cast of coronation street also featured in the telethon .
last year 's event hit the £ 30m mark for the first time in its history , including the donations that flood in in the weeks after the live broadcast .
the first , in 1980 , raised more than £ 1m .
bbc radio cambridgeshire dj max rushden began his record-breaking broadcast at 1500 gmt on sunday .
he only took naps between records and has raised more than £ 4,000 for the appeal .

mr blair said of children in need : " there 's this huge sense of coming together - the whole country comes together and says this is a cause worth supporting .
" we still need children in need because whatever wealth the country has as a whole there are kids who have been either thrown out of their families or come from very , very poor circumstances and they are not in the ordinary education system and the ordinary social services - that 's not going to help them . "
among the groups to benefit is the downs syndrome educational trust in portsmouth , which has been awarded £ 20,000 a year for the next three years .
katrina skipsey , whose four-year-old daughter violet has downs syndrome , said cash from children in need was a vital and welcome boost .
this year 's children in need single is i 'll stand by you , a cover of the old pretenders classic , by girl band girls aloud .
the bbc 's first broadcast appeal for children took place in 1927 , in the form of a five-minute radio broadcast on christmas day .
it raised about £ 1,143 which equates to about £ 27,150 by today 's standards .
the first televised appeal took place in 1955 and was called the children 's hour christmas appeal , with sooty and harry corbett fronting it .
dramatic increase the appeal in 1980 was broadcast for the first time as a telethon .
this event , hosted by terry wogan , sue lawley and esther rantzen , captured the public 's imagination to such an extent that the amount raised increased dramatically to more than £ 1 million .

christmas broadcast on friday morning , prime minister tony blair met some children who have been helped by money raised from last year 's appeal .
mr blair said of children in need : " there 's this huge sense of coming together - the whole country comes together and says this is a cause worth supporting .
some of the stars who have given their support to children in need over the years in pictures " we still need children in need because whatever wealth the country has as a whole there are kids who have been either thrown out of their families or come from very , very poor circumstances and they are not in the ordinary education system and the ordinary social services - that 's not going to help them . "
among the groups to benefit is the downs syndrome educational trust in portsmouth , which has been awarded £ 20,000 a year for the next three years .
katrina skipsey , whose four-year-old daughter violet has downs syndrome , said cash from children in need was a vital and welcome boost .
this year 's children in need single is i 'll stand by you , a cover of the old pretenders classic , by girl band girls aloud .
the bbc 's first broadcast appeal for children took place in 1927 , in the form of a five-minute radio broadcast on christmas day .
bbc news : video and audio watch highlights from the night it raised about £ 1,143 which equates to about £ 27,150 by today 's standards .
the first televised appeal took place in 1955 and was called the children 's hour christmas appeal , with sooty and harry corbett fronting it .
dramatic increase the appeal in 1980 was broadcast for the first time as a telethon .
this event , hosted by terry wogan , sue lawley and esther rantzen , captured the public 's imagination to such an extent that the amount raised increased dramatically to more than £ 1 million .
pudsey bear followed five years later and is now the bbc children in need 's mascot and official logo .

it is difficult to imagine a place more pivotal to the future of africa than the dr congo .
there are of course more important countries in terms of economic power and political clout .
south africa , nigeria and half a dozen other african states can be ranked as serious players on the world stage .
the region 's conflicts have left an array of displaced people but since congo 's latest war broke out in 1996 , its potential to drag down the prospects of the whole continent have once again become clear .
at the height of the war , the armies of nine african countries were either directly or indirectly involved in dr congo .
most of them still have influence through the medium of proxy militias , mafia-style business networks or ethnic links .
under the transitional peace deal government dr congo has a president and four vice-presidents drawn from the main local players in the conflict .
it also has the most expensive un peacekeeping force in the world -lrb- it costs around $ 700 million a year -rrb- and is due to hold elections next june .
explosive region after a journey through the war-torn east of the country - i went from bunia in the north-east to uvira in the south-east - i find the idea of holding fair elections across the country , in just a few months ' time , almost inconceivable .
eastern congo is a critical part of a critical country because it borders uganda , rwanda and burundi .
quick guide the war in dr congo all of these countries have their own internal conflicts .
and all of them , in one way or another , have intervened militarily in congo .
rwanda is the key .
despite its small geographical size , it has one of the most powerful armies in the region .
it has intervened directly in congo at least twice on the grounds that the remnants of the ethnic hutu army which committed the rwandan genocide of 1994 are still a coherent force hiding in the forests of congo .
the government in the rwandan capital kigali argues that the armed hutu represent a threat to ethnic tutsi civilians in rwanda .
this is almost certainly true .
but more importantly , given the cynical way power is exercised , they are also a threat to the tutsi-dominated military-economic power network which extends well beyond the borders of rwanda .
indeed , some independent experts argue that kigali could do more to neutralise the hutu extremists but that it does not do so because it finds their presence , though dangerous , to be useful .
under this theory , the hutus serve as a pretext for the rwandan military / business elite to plunder congo 's rich resources .
this analysis is of course angrily rejected by rwandan government officials .
they say it is tantamount to suggesting that they are using the victims of the 1994 genocide - and even future potential victims of violence - as political tools .
military escorts almost everywhere i went in eastern congo i was told by the un , which helped me on my journey , that i needed a military escort .
i drove out of bunia with pakistani armoured personnel carriers at the front and the rear of my vehicle ; i travelled outside the village of walungu with a combined un and congolese government army patrol ; and i made a journey along the ruzizi river plain , from uvira to kamanyola , with an escort of un troops from uruguay .
and almost everywhere i went there were armed militiamen at roadblocks designed to mark territory and extort illegal taxes .
i also saw a bewildering array of war-displaced people - villagers who had been attacked by one armed group because they were perceived to be sympathetic to another .
the war-displaced gather under plastic sheeting in pathetic groups scattered across the country , or they mingle hopefully outside town halls and un positions waiting for alms .
un ' glue ' the un is the glue which is holding congo together .
although it is stretched absurdly thinly - currently about 10,000 soldiers for a country larger than western europe - it seems clear that without a un force , and international pressure for peace , the war would have been even longer , bigger and more deadly .
with so few soldiers the un can not , as a rule , physically stop fighting .
it can occasionally ; un helicopter gunships recently opened fire , for example , on a warlord in the south-east and stopped his advance .
but more typically , the un encourages and facilitates dialogue .
in such a war-ravaged and huge country , this role is vital .
but it can not go on like this forever .
the glue that holds congo together should be the country 's government and army .
but neither of these institutions yet works properly .
in these circumstances , the idea of holding fair elections in a few months ' time sounds like a bad joke .
one observer in kinshasa said that by pressing for quick elections the international community was trying to rebuild congo on the cheap .
given congo 's history of generations of war , dictatorship and kleptocracy - from the time of the belgian dictator king leopold through local post-colonial versions of similar administrations - the observer said , such elections were doomed to failure .
pressing for quick elections , he said , was pure wishful thinking - like waiting for the messiah and a ticket to paradise .

it is difficult to imagine a place more pivotal to the future of africa than the dr congo .
there are of course more important countries in terms of economic power and political clout .
south africa , nigeria and half a dozen other african states can be ranked as serious players on the world stage .
the region 's conflicts have left an array of displaced people but since congo 's latest war broke out in 1996 , its potential to drag down the prospects of the whole continent have once again become clear .
at the height of the war , the armies of nine african countries were either directly or indirectly involved in dr congo .
most of them still have influence through the medium of proxy militias , mafia-style business networks or ethnic links .
under the transitional peace deal government dr congo has a president and four vice-presidents drawn from the main local players in the conflict .
it also has the most expensive un peacekeeping force in the world -lrb- it costs around $ 700 million a year -rrb- and is due to hold elections next june .
explosive region after a journey through the war-torn east of the country - i went from bunia in the north-east to uvira in the south-east - i find the idea of holding fair elections across the country , in just a few months ' time , almost inconceivable .
eastern congo is a critical part of a critical country because it borders uganda , rwanda and burundi .
quick guide the war in dr congo all of these countries have their own internal conflicts .
and all of them , in one way or another , have intervened militarily in congo .
rwanda is the key .
despite its small geographical size , it has one of the most powerful armies in the region .
it has intervened directly in congo at least twice on the grounds that the remnants of the ethnic hutu army which committed the rwandan genocide of 1994 are still a coherent force hiding in the forests of congo .
the government in the rwandan capital kigali argues that the armed hutu represent a threat to ethnic tutsi civilians in rwanda .
this is almost certainly true .
but more importantly , given the cynical way power is exercised , they are also a threat to the tutsi-dominated military-economic power network which extends well beyond the borders of rwanda .
indeed , some independent experts argue that kigali could do more to neutralise the hutu extremists but that it does not do so because it finds their presence , though dangerous , to be useful .
under this theory , the hutus serve as a pretext for the rwandan military / business elite to plunder congo 's rich resources .
this analysis is of course angrily rejected by rwandan government officials .
they say it is tantamount to suggesting that they are using the victims of the 1994 genocide - and even future potential victims of violence - as political tools .
military escorts almost everywhere i went in eastern congo i was told by the un , which helped me on my journey , that i needed a military escort .
i drove out of bunia with pakistani armoured personnel carriers at the front and the rear of my vehicle ; i travelled outside the village of walungu with a combined un and congolese government army patrol ; and i made a journey along the ruzizi river plain , from uvira to kamanyola , with an escort of un troops from uruguay .
and almost everywhere i went there were armed militiamen at roadblocks designed to mark territory and extort illegal taxes .
i also saw a bewildering array of war-displaced people - villagers who had been attacked by one armed group because they were perceived to be sympathetic to another .
the war-displaced gather under plastic sheeting in pathetic groups scattered across the country , or they mingle hopefully outside town halls and un positions waiting for alms .
un ' glue ' the un is the glue which is holding congo together .
although it is stretched absurdly thinly - currently about 10,000 soldiers for a country larger than western europe - it seems clear that without a un force , and international pressure for peace , the war would have been even longer , bigger and more deadly .
with so few soldiers the un can not , as a rule , physically stop fighting .
it can occasionally ; un helicopter gunships recently opened fire , for example , on a warlord in the south-east and stopped his advance .
but more typically , the un encourages and facilitates dialogue .
in such a war-ravaged and huge country , this role is vital .
but it can not go on like this forever .
the glue that holds congo together should be the country 's government and army .
but neither of these institutions yet works properly .
in these circumstances , the idea of holding fair elections in a few months ' time sounds like a bad joke .
one observer in kinshasa said that by pressing for quick elections the international community was trying to rebuild congo on the cheap .
given congo 's history of generations of war , dictatorship and kleptocracy - from the time of the belgian dictator king leopold through local post-colonial versions of similar administrations - the observer said , such elections were doomed to failure .
pressing for quick elections , he said , was pure wishful thinking - like waiting for the messiah and a ticket to paradise .

the donated processor cycles will help the wcg create virtual supercomputers via the net .
the idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop pcs .
one of the most successful collaboration projects was seti @ home , run by the search for extra terrestrial life project , which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication .

once installed , the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process , and reports back after completing that task .
the first wcg problem being tackled will be the human proteome folding project , which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold .
the subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences , and technology .
the body will evaluate proposals from leading research , public and not-for-profit organizations , and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year .
organisations also represented on the board include the united nations development programme and the world health organisation .

oracle said 228.7 million peoplesoft shares had been tendered , giving it the majority support it required to keep its $ 24-per-share offer alive .
the software giant has extended its takeover offer until 31 december .
oracle has made five bids for peoplesoft during the last 18 months , which have all been rejected .
bid ' inadequate ' the company 's chief executive larry ellison has said he was prepared to enter a " definitive merger agreement " this weekend .
peoplesoft spokesman steve swasey said his company would not be " commenting at this point " .
peoplesoft - which maintains oracle 's offer is inadequate - has previously said it would fight the takeover into next year .
it has said it will attempt to thwart a takeover by doubling the number of its shares in circulation .
however , many financial analysts believe that investors will have no choice but to accept the offer .
if oracle were to walk away , peoplesoft 's share price could fall by more than 30 % , they believe , leaving shareholders worse off .
on friday , peoplesoft 's shares gained 25 cents to close at $ 23.17 on the nasdaq in new york while oracle 's shares plummeted by 22 cents to reach $ 12.75 .

oracle said 228.7 million peoplesoft shares had been tendered , giving it the majority support it required to keep its $ 24-per-share offer alive .
the software giant has extended its takeover offer until 31 december .
oracle has made five bids for peoplesoft during the last 18 months , which have all been rejected .
bid ' inadequate ' the company 's chief executive larry ellison has said he was prepared to enter a " definitive merger agreement " this weekend .
peoplesoft spokesman steve swasey said his company would not be " commenting at this point " .
peoplesoft - which maintains oracle 's offer is inadequate - has previously said it would fight the takeover into next year .
it has said it will attempt to thwart a takeover by doubling the number of its shares in circulation .
however , many financial analysts believe that investors will have no choice but to accept the offer .
if oracle were to walk away , peoplesoft 's share price could fall by more than 30 % , they believe , leaving shareholders worse off .
on friday , peoplesoft 's shares gained 25 cents to close at $ 23.17 on the nasdaq in new york while oracle 's shares plummeted by 22 cents to reach $ 12.75 .
