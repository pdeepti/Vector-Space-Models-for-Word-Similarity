" we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .

"
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .

his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .
bavarian politicians who aspire to fame beyond the borders of their state – have the luxury of choosing the myth that ’ s bound to bring them the most votes . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria says " grüß gott " in chinese bavaria is pulling out all the stops to woo chinese tourists : a tv series , a chinese web site and a picture book are initiating the chinese in the state 's blend of castles , photo-op lederhosen and the oktoberfest .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes .

its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .
bavarian politicians who aspire to fame beyond the borders of their state – have the luxury of choosing the myth that ’ s bound to bring them the most votes . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria says " grüß gott " in chinese bavaria is pulling out all the stops to woo chinese tourists : a tv series , a chinese web site and a picture book are initiating the chinese in the state 's blend of castles , photo-op lederhosen and the oktoberfest .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

germany offered to train iraqi experts on bomb disposal techniques . german police arrested three iraqis on friday in anti-terror raids across several cities in connection with the prime minister 's visit to the country . on saturday , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office announced a fourth man had been arrested in his berlin apartment on suspicion of offering support to the attack plans and of supporting a terrorist organisation . a statement from the german federal prosecutors ' office said the men had been detained during raids at locations in berlin , augsburg and stuttgart .
they were being held as suspected members of ansar al-islam , a militant group originating in northern iraq .
they were thought to be planning an attack on allawi during his visit to the german capital on friday . the three suspects arrested on friday are due to come before a court on saturday to face a formal arrest order . federal prosecutor kay nehm told reporters that tapped phone conversations between suspected members of the islamic extremist group " included increasing clues that an attack was being planned . " " the comments led us to believe something was being planned against the iraqi prime minister , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight during allawi 's visit ; this police sniper is guarding the chancellery in berlin nehm would not elaborate on whether authorities knew what kind of attack the three mind have planned and said the suspects appeared to have been acting on the spur of the moment , seizing the opportunity of allawi 's visit .
he added that initial searches by police had not found any weapons or bomb-making materials . german authorities said ansar al-islam has about 100 supporters in germany and the united states has linked the group , which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in iraq , to al qaeda .
germany has been investigating the group 's activities , which nehm said included fundraising , trafficking and propaganda . bomb disposal while germany has been a vocal opponent of the war in iraq , it has offered to broaden its role in training iraqis .
at a news conference in berlin following the meeting between allawi and chancellor gerhard schröder , the german leader said he had offered to train iraqi bomb disposal experts and host a bilateral business conference . " we are considering training explosive ordnance removal specialists in germany , " schröder told reporters , noting that germany was already involved in training iraqi police and troops in the united arab emirates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and ayad allawi leave a press conference in berlin held after their meeting while germany said it is prepared to contribute to the stabilization of iraq , it has stuck to its stance that it will not send troops into the country .
it has added that any aid must be conducted outside of iraq . he and schröder had met one month ago when allawi came to brussels looking to secure funds .
then , he angered many europeans by describing states which opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators . " ahead of the meeting , allawi struck a more conciliatory note , saying the purpose of his visit was not to ask for more german troops , but rather to seek additional reconstruction help . " for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important , " allawi wrote in an article published on thursday in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily . so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .
21 the german army has been conducting additional courses there for iraqi soldiers . bilateral conference schröder added that germany would invite iraqi investors in february or march next year to discuss business opportunities in the war-torn country with the aim of creating a bilateral chamber of commerce .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" european industry is very interested in these kinds of high-tech materials .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .
bavarian politicians who aspire to fame beyond the borders of their state – have the luxury of choosing the myth that ’ s bound to bring them the most votes . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria says " grüß gott " in chinese bavaria is pulling out all the stops to woo chinese tourists : a tv series , a chinese web site and a picture book are initiating the chinese in the state 's blend of castles , photo-op lederhosen and the oktoberfest .

it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes .

its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .

it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced .

" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday .

" only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .

but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .

" only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .

but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .

his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced .

" we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .
bavarian politicians who aspire to fame beyond the borders of their state – have the luxury of choosing the myth that ’ s bound to bring them the most votes . mariana schroeder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria says " grüß gott " in chinese bavaria is pulling out all the stops to woo chinese tourists : a tv series , a chinese web site and a picture book are initiating the chinese in the state 's blend of castles , photo-op lederhosen and the oktoberfest .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .

germany offered to train iraqi experts on bomb disposal techniques . german police arrested three iraqis on friday in anti-terror raids across several cities in connection with the prime minister 's visit to the country . on saturday , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office announced a fourth man had been arrested in his berlin apartment on suspicion of offering support to the attack plans and of supporting a terrorist organisation . a statement from the german federal prosecutors ' office said the men had been detained during raids at locations in berlin , augsburg and stuttgart .
they were being held as suspected members of ansar al-islam , a militant group originating in northern iraq .
they were thought to be planning an attack on allawi during his visit to the german capital on friday . the three suspects arrested on friday are due to come before a court on saturday to face a formal arrest order . federal prosecutor kay nehm told reporters that tapped phone conversations between suspected members of the islamic extremist group " included increasing clues that an attack was being planned . " " the comments led us to believe something was being planned against the iraqi prime minister , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight during allawi 's visit ; this police sniper is guarding the chancellery in berlin nehm would not elaborate on whether authorities knew what kind of attack the three mind have planned and said the suspects appeared to have been acting on the spur of the moment , seizing the opportunity of allawi 's visit .
he added that initial searches by police had not found any weapons or bomb-making materials . german authorities said ansar al-islam has about 100 supporters in germany and the united states has linked the group , which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in iraq , to al qaeda .
germany has been investigating the group 's activities , which nehm said included fundraising , trafficking and propaganda . bomb disposal while germany has been a vocal opponent of the war in iraq , it has offered to broaden its role in training iraqis .
at a news conference in berlin following the meeting between allawi and chancellor gerhard schröder , the german leader said he had offered to train iraqi bomb disposal experts and host a bilateral business conference . " we are considering training explosive ordnance removal specialists in germany , " schröder told reporters , noting that germany was already involved in training iraqi police and troops in the united arab emirates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and ayad allawi leave a press conference in berlin held after their meeting while germany said it is prepared to contribute to the stabilization of iraq , it has stuck to its stance that it will not send troops into the country .
it has added that any aid must be conducted outside of iraq . he and schröder had met one month ago when allawi came to brussels looking to secure funds .
then , he angered many europeans by describing states which opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators . " ahead of the meeting , allawi struck a more conciliatory note , saying the purpose of his visit was not to ask for more german troops , but rather to seek additional reconstruction help . " for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important , " allawi wrote in an article published on thursday in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily . so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .
21 the german army has been conducting additional courses there for iraqi soldiers . bilateral conference schröder added that germany would invite iraqi investors in february or march next year to discuss business opportunities in the war-torn country with the aim of creating a bilateral chamber of commerce . " there have been very good , long-standing economic ties between iraq and germany throughout the periods of history which we can build on , " schroeder told afp .

but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .

on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

at a news conference in berlin following the meeting between allawi and chancellor gerhard schröder , the german leader said he had offered to train iraqi bomb disposal experts and host a bilateral business conference . " we are considering training explosive ordnance removal specialists in germany , " schröder told reporters , noting that germany was already involved in training iraqi police and troops in the united arab emirates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and ayad allawi leave a press conference in berlin held after their meeting while germany said it is prepared to contribute to the stabilization of iraq , it has stuck to its stance that it will not send troops into the country .
it has added that any aid must be conducted outside of iraq . he and schröder had met one month ago when allawi came to brussels looking to secure funds .
then , he angered many europeans by describing states which opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators . " ahead of the meeting , allawi struck a more conciliatory note , saying the purpose of his visit was not to ask for more german troops , but rather to seek additional reconstruction help . " for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important , " allawi wrote in an article published on thursday in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily . so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .

" there have been very good , long-standing economic ties between iraq and germany throughout the periods of history which we can build on , " schroeder told afp .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .

in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" european industry is very interested in these kinds of high-tech materials . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edwin " buzz " aldrin , man on the moon on the basis of suits for astronauts made with these materials , developers on earth have fashioned protective clothing for pilots , firefighters , rescue service personnel , motorcyclists and divers . isolating polymer films , such as that used in space stations , ensure that vacuum chambers in computer tomography devices work correctly , since operating temperatures of minus 270 degrees are not unusual .
carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .

techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

germany offered to train iraqi experts on bomb disposal techniques . german police arrested three iraqis on friday in anti-terror raids across several cities in connection with the prime minister 's visit to the country . on saturday , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office announced a fourth man had been arrested in his berlin apartment on suspicion of offering support to the attack plans and of supporting a terrorist organisation . a statement from the german federal prosecutors ' office said the men had been detained during raids at locations in berlin , augsburg and stuttgart .
they were being held as suspected members of ansar al-islam , a militant group originating in northern iraq .
they were thought to be planning an attack on allawi during his visit to the german capital on friday . the three suspects arrested on friday are due to come before a court on saturday to face a formal arrest order . federal prosecutor kay nehm told reporters that tapped phone conversations between suspected members of the islamic extremist group " included increasing clues that an attack was being planned . " " the comments led us to believe something was being planned against the iraqi prime minister , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight during allawi 's visit ; this police sniper is guarding the chancellery in berlin nehm would not elaborate on whether authorities knew what kind of attack the three mind have planned and said the suspects appeared to have been acting on the spur of the moment , seizing the opportunity of allawi 's visit .
he added that initial searches by police had not found any weapons or bomb-making materials . german authorities said ansar al-islam has about 100 supporters in germany and the united states has linked the group , which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in iraq , to al qaeda .

at a news conference in berlin following the meeting between allawi and chancellor gerhard schröder , the german leader said he had offered to train iraqi bomb disposal experts and host a bilateral business conference . " we are considering training explosive ordnance removal specialists in germany , " schröder told reporters , noting that germany was already involved in training iraqi police and troops in the united arab emirates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and ayad allawi leave a press conference in berlin held after their meeting while germany said it is prepared to contribute to the stabilization of iraq , it has stuck to its stance that it will not send troops into the country .
it has added that any aid must be conducted outside of iraq . he and schröder had met one month ago when allawi came to brussels looking to secure funds .
then , he angered many europeans by describing states which opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators . " ahead of the meeting , allawi struck a more conciliatory note , saying the purpose of his visit was not to ask for more german troops , but rather to seek additional reconstruction help . " for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important , " allawi wrote in an article published on thursday in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily . so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

"
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands .

" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations .

on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .

putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .

germany offered to train iraqi experts on bomb disposal techniques . german police arrested three iraqis on friday in anti-terror raids across several cities in connection with the prime minister 's visit to the country . on saturday , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office announced a fourth man had been arrested in his berlin apartment on suspicion of offering support to the attack plans and of supporting a terrorist organisation . a statement from the german federal prosecutors ' office said the men had been detained during raids at locations in berlin , augsburg and stuttgart .
they were being held as suspected members of ansar al-islam , a militant group originating in northern iraq .
they were thought to be planning an attack on allawi during his visit to the german capital on friday . the three suspects arrested on friday are due to come before a court on saturday to face a formal arrest order . federal prosecutor kay nehm told reporters that tapped phone conversations between suspected members of the islamic extremist group " included increasing clues that an attack was being planned . " " the comments led us to believe something was being planned against the iraqi prime minister , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight during allawi 's visit ; this police sniper is guarding the chancellery in berlin nehm would not elaborate on whether authorities knew what kind of attack the three mind have planned and said the suspects appeared to have been acting on the spur of the moment , seizing the opportunity of allawi 's visit .
he added that initial searches by police had not found any weapons or bomb-making materials . german authorities said ansar al-islam has about 100 supporters in germany and the united states has linked the group , which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in iraq , to al qaeda .
germany has been investigating the group 's activities , which nehm said included fundraising , trafficking and propaganda . bomb disposal while germany has been a vocal opponent of the war in iraq , it has offered to broaden its role in training iraqis .
at a news conference in berlin following the meeting between allawi and chancellor gerhard schröder , the german leader said he had offered to train iraqi bomb disposal experts and host a bilateral business conference . " we are considering training explosive ordnance removal specialists in germany , " schröder told reporters , noting that germany was already involved in training iraqi police and troops in the united arab emirates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and ayad allawi leave a press conference in berlin held after their meeting while germany said it is prepared to contribute to the stabilization of iraq , it has stuck to its stance that it will not send troops into the country .
it has added that any aid must be conducted outside of iraq . he and schröder had met one month ago when allawi came to brussels looking to secure funds .
then , he angered many europeans by describing states which opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators . " ahead of the meeting , allawi struck a more conciliatory note , saying the purpose of his visit was not to ask for more german troops , but rather to seek additional reconstruction help . " for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important , " allawi wrote in an article published on thursday in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily . so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .

" there have been very good , long-standing economic ties between iraq and germany throughout the periods of history which we can build on , " schroeder told afp .

" he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes . " bavaria is proud of its culture , " she said .
" it invests a lot of money but it is not innovative culture , it is very conservative , going back to baroque traditions . " still , bavaria ’ s cultural institutions lead all others in germany .
its opera celebrated its 350th anniversary last year and is the oldest opera north of the alps .
its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .
despite the advance of media firms and high tech industries one out of eight jobs in the state depends on agriculture or forestry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian wheat farmers bavarian farmers produce one fourth of all milk and a fifth of all the grain in germany .
it is the world ’ s biggest hops producer and europe ’ s most important gherkin grower .
but agriculture accounts for only 1 percent of the state ’ s gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- .
about 32 percent of the gnp comes from the industrial sector which includes global firms like the electronics giant siemens and automakers bmw and audi .
bavaria also provides european headquarters to many of the world ’ s computer companies .
perhaps it is this last myth that will remain bavaria ’ s most lasting one .
a state of farmers providing a home to high-tech industries – lederhosen and laptops .
but the other myth ’ s continue along side it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the bavarian alps for music lovers bavaria remains the land of wagner , for tourists it is the land of ludwig the second and his fairy tale castles .
others prefer the fields and forests .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .
in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .
his neuschwanstein castle became a model for walt disney ’ s fairy tale castles and has been attracting visitors ever since the king ’ s tragic death in 1886 . long before king ludwig himself became a myth he was instrumental in providing bavaria with one of its strongest symbols - and another myth : bavaria , the land of wagner .
richard wagner was born in leipzig and died in venice but his music is identified with bavaria . it was thanks to ludwig the second ’ s sponsorship that the controversial maestro was able to create his famous ring of the nibelungen and eventually build his festspielhaus in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner nike wagner -lrb- photo -rrb- , a direct descendant of the composer says bavaria identifies with her great , great , great grandfather ’ s music and is proud of its cultural but fundamentally conservative in its musical tastes .

its state orchestra is even older .
not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .
bavaria remains the most important agrarian state in germany , and a major farming region in europe .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .
but a sense of rural romanticism still exists . beer 's still a given and what would bavaria be without beer ?
the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .
but neither the brew nor the noise is limited to oktoberfest .
every beer hall offers its special variant , the most famous being the hofbräuhaus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stemming those steins at the hofbräuhaus along with the beer myth is the myth of the smiling bavarian waitress who runs back and forth among wooden tables carrying up to 12 liter-sized mugs of beer .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

germany offered to train iraqi experts on bomb disposal techniques . german police arrested three iraqis on friday in anti-terror raids across several cities in connection with the prime minister 's visit to the country . on saturday , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office announced a fourth man had been arrested in his berlin apartment on suspicion of offering support to the attack plans and of supporting a terrorist organisation . a statement from the german federal prosecutors ' office said the men had been detained during raids at locations in berlin , augsburg and stuttgart .
they were being held as suspected members of ansar al-islam , a militant group originating in northern iraq .
they were thought to be planning an attack on allawi during his visit to the german capital on friday . the three suspects arrested on friday are due to come before a court on saturday to face a formal arrest order . federal prosecutor kay nehm told reporters that tapped phone conversations between suspected members of the islamic extremist group " included increasing clues that an attack was being planned . " " the comments led us to believe something was being planned against the iraqi prime minister , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight during allawi 's visit ; this police sniper is guarding the chancellery in berlin nehm would not elaborate on whether authorities knew what kind of attack the three mind have planned and said the suspects appeared to have been acting on the spur of the moment , seizing the opportunity of allawi 's visit .
he added that initial searches by police had not found any weapons or bomb-making materials . german authorities said ansar al-islam has about 100 supporters in germany and the united states has linked the group , which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in iraq , to al qaeda .
germany has been investigating the group 's activities , which nehm said included fundraising , trafficking and propaganda . bomb disposal while germany has been a vocal opponent of the war in iraq , it has offered to broaden its role in training iraqis .
at a news conference in berlin following the meeting between allawi and chancellor gerhard schröder , the german leader said he had offered to train iraqi bomb disposal experts and host a bilateral business conference . " we are considering training explosive ordnance removal specialists in germany , " schröder told reporters , noting that germany was already involved in training iraqi police and troops in the united arab emirates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and ayad allawi leave a press conference in berlin held after their meeting while germany said it is prepared to contribute to the stabilization of iraq , it has stuck to its stance that it will not send troops into the country .
it has added that any aid must be conducted outside of iraq . he and schröder had met one month ago when allawi came to brussels looking to secure funds .
then , he angered many europeans by describing states which opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators . " ahead of the meeting , allawi struck a more conciliatory note , saying the purpose of his visit was not to ask for more german troops , but rather to seek additional reconstruction help . " for our security , we need better iraqi troops , not additional soldiers from faraway countries .
that 's why germany training iraqi personnel in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- is so important , " allawi wrote in an article published on thursday in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily . so far , germany has trained 430 iraqi police in the uae , and since nov .
21 the german army has been conducting additional courses there for iraqi soldiers . bilateral conference schröder added that germany would invite iraqi investors in february or march next year to discuss business opportunities in the war-torn country with the aim of creating a bilateral chamber of commerce . " there have been very good , long-standing economic ties between iraq and germany throughout the periods of history which we can build on , " schroeder told afp .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .

but germany 's largest state is still trying to find the right balance between laptops and lederhosen . it is the land of king ludwig ii , the reclusive and mysterious monarch who gave bavaria its legacy of fairy tale castles , which are among the region 's most popular tourist attractions .
it is also a land of ” lederhosen and laptops ” – the slogan coined by the state government to encapsulate bavaria ’ s characteristic traditions and its high tech industries . but it ’ s sometimes difficult to separate the myth of bavaria - what people believe bavaria to be - from the many clichés associated with it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows rest in front of a typical bavarian church by far the largest german state in terms of area and the second most populous with 10.7 million people , bavaria also has the longest political tradition that dates back to the sixth century .
the so-called " free state " is home to some of germany 's most captivating landscapes , including the foothills of the alps and germany ’ s highest mountain , the zugspitze , which rises nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,849 feet -rrb- above sea level . a large part of the myth of bavaria stems from its scenery with picturesque lakes , the bavarian forest - the first german national park - and the valleys of the danube and the main and their tributaries .
bavaria is dotted with onion-domed churches and red-tiled houses which are often painted colorfully , sometimes illustrating religious themes .
the setting was perfect for the bavarian film industry from the 1930s to the 1950s . the so-called heimatfilm , or homeland film , genre reached its zenith in the 1950s and spread not only the myth of bavaria , but also many of the clichés associated with the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress barbara rütting talks to a vulture during filming for the 1956 picture " die geierwally " the films dealt with predictable situations : the dairy maids spend their lonely summers in the mountains milking the cows and making cheese .
the rebellious men are poachers , refusing to bow to the restrictions of an increasingly urban society . germany 's media center heimat films are now a thing of the past , but the film industry remains and has become a part of a new bavarian myth : bavaria as the world ’ s top media center . to keep the myth alive , bavarian politicians provide at least € 25 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million -rrb- annually to promote the state as the country ’ s film factory .
although it lacks some of the glamour of hollywood , bavaria and its capital munich produce feature films and tv programs . the media myth has replaced the idyll of an agricultural state with munich as the capital of germany 's largest farming area .
following world war ii , munich billed itself as " germany 's secret capital " and became the focal point of a rapidly growing industrial region . bildunterschrift : bmw headquarters in munich now it is better known for automobiles , aircraft , electrical engineering and electronics and insurance than for farm products which formed the backbone of bavaria ’ s economy in the last century .

the oktoberfest attracts around six million people , who come from all over the world to experience the particularly bavarian mixture of beer and bonhomie .

in the hofbräuhaus , waitresses naturally wear the traditional dress that is also a part of the bavarian rural myth .
for women it is the dirndl – a tight-bodiced dress with a full skirt and an apron .
for men — that icon of bavarian chic – the lederhosen . but the costume which so symbolizes bavaria only came into being in the 19th century when bavarian king maximilian ii decided the country needed some sort of corporate identity to unify it – so the lederhosen and dirndls were promoted to provide bavaria with its most popular symbols . castles and composers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein remains one of germany 's top tourist destinations another king , ludwig ii , provided bavaria with a symbol that attracts millions of tourists from all over the world .

not only wagner , but wolfgang amadeus mozart and richard strauss premiered their operas in munich . hops vs. high-tech bavaria ’ s newest myth is that it is the land of lederhosen and laptops - a state combining traditional values with hi tech industries .

but many seemingly far-fetched ideas for space have very earth-bound applications . temperature fluxuations in outer space are extreme , and swings from minus 160 degrees to 160 degrees on the other side of zero in a short period of time are common .
for these kinds of conditions , space scientists have developed special synthetic materials that are light , able to withstand mechanical pressures , and are resistant to bombardments by cosmic particles and other forms of intense radiation . " these innovative materials help us solve problems on the earth , " said pierre brisson , head of the technology transfer program of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .

carbon fibers that are used in satellite construction are also incorporated into formula one racing cars , airplanes and industrial robots . architecture after the severe earthquake that struck the turkish city of izmit five years ago , scientists at esa headquarters in paris had the idea to use space technology in the construction of a " space house " on earth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model of a " space house " the theory was to use a very light , scallop-shaped plastic design that could withstand strong quakes and wind speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour .
a prototype is now in the planning and scientists hope that the new german neumayer iii station in the antarctic will be based on the design . cancer research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmic storm space research is also opening up new chapters in the fight against cancer .
techniques used by astronomers to use signals from several telescopes to discover the tiniest planets despite the glare from nearby stars , is now being adapted for the early detection of cancer . dutch researchers are already using technology developed for esa 's darwin mission , which will scan 1,000 stars for nearby planets , to look for the tiniest changes in blood vessels and retinas . this is not the first time space technology has been used in the fight against cancer .
a computer program that searches for the sources of x-rays in the far reaches of the universe has already been modified to look for the very earliest signs of skin cancer . clean air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of a lab in space the same technology that ensured the air aboard the russian mir space station was clean has also been used to filter out viruses , mold , spores and bacteria from the air in hospitals .
scientists hope to use the same concept to dispose of sars , ebola and tuberculosis pathogens . this system , which uses electric fields and so-called cold-plasma chambers , is already in use at five european hospitals to create germ-free " air zones " over patients ' beds . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe approaches moon europe 's first mission to the moon , the unmanned exploratory probe smart-1 , has been safely placed in lunar orbit after a voyage of more than 13 months , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- announced on tuesday .

prime minster viktor yanukovych will stay in the race , according to a spokeswoman . ukraine 's bitterly disputed runoff poll may have polarized the country and sent long-faded cold war-era shadows back to the world stage , but the capital kiev was in the mood for a party on friday night as opposition supporters celebrated on the streets what they see as a victory for their candidate , viktor yushchenko . the central election commission and parliament were due to meet later on saturday to discuss logistics of the new election after the high court stripped the ruling party 's candidate , viktor yanukovych , of victory in the contested november 21 poll . in a landmark ruling , the supreme court agreed with an appeal by opposition leader viktor yushchenko that results from that poll should be annulled because of widespread fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anatoly yarema , presiding judge of ukraine 's supreme court " we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote ... from december 5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the chief justice anatoly yarema -lrb- photo -rrb- announced . " the court decision is final and can not be appealed , " he said , reading from the ruling . opposition officials said the vote would likely take place on december 26 .
the election commission is expected to set the date for the new election within days , which parliament must then approve and outgoing president leonid kuchma must sign . on saturday , a spokeswoman for prime minister viktor yanukovych , anna german , told reporters he will be a candidate in a new run-off election . " he is convinced he will win the second time as he won the first time since 15 million ukrainians stand behind him , " she said . party mood the reaction of the pro-west opposition to the court 's decision was quick and deafening .
kiev 's central independence square erupted into cheers from hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters who have massed there round-the-clock for nearly two weeks . " yu-shchen-ko !
yu-shchen-ko ! " the crowd chanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when opposition leaders read off the names of the 21 supreme court justices who handed down the historic ruling , the square greeted each with a deafening roar .
" way to go !
way to go ! " the hero of the hour hailed his supporters shortly after . " the decision was taken thanks to you , you are heroes , " yushchenko told a veritable sea of supporters clad in the orange color of his campaign .
in the center of the capital , a boisterous party erupted after yushchenko told backers the court ruling had been a victory for their " orange revolution . " " ukraine is henceforth a true democratic state , " he said in kiev 's independence square , where supporters have thronged for the past 12 days . " we 're going to have awesome fireworks tomorrow , " he promised . divisive issue the contested vote had split this former soviet republic of 48 million in half and resonated on the world stage , too , as russia backed yanukovych and the united states and the european union supported yushchenko 's claims . european heavyweights like polish president aleksander kwasniewski and eu foreign policy chief javier solana traveled twice to kiev to mediate tense negotiations between the opposition and the ruling regime during the nearly two-week standoff . washington and brussels immediately welcomed the court ruling friday . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . " i welcome this independent decision ... which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . as of early saturday , russia had yet to issue a comment on the ruling . several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovych was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court orders new ukrainian election ukraine 's supreme court ruled friday that contested presidential elections were tainted by fraud and must be repeated , handing a historic victory to pro-western opposition forces .

court orders new ukrainian election yushchenko poisoned , doctors say ukraine divided over election rerun europe -pipe- 04.12.2004 berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , and putin do n't see eye to eye on ukraine german foreign minister joschka fischer hailed the decision by ukraine 's supreme court to order a re-run of the disputed election run-off .
but russia 's vladimir putin strongly criticized western european and us policies . fischer in an interview with german public radio described the court 's ruling on friday as a " wise decision " that would allow the crisis that broke out following the november 21 polls to be settled " on a democratic basis . "
a solution was " within reach , " he added , also welcoming the fact that russia had abided by the landmark legal ruling . fischer also denied that the political upheaval in ukraine could damage relations between the european union and russia . russia , which endorsed the election 's official winner prime minister viktor yanukovych despite allegations of fraud , has slammed the eu for encouraging efforts by the western-leaning opposition to seek a re-run of the vote . russia 's state duma on friday adopted a scathing resolution condemning the eu , the european parliament and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe for their support of opposition demands . " the european union did not intervene in the electoral battle , " fischer insisted in the interview .
" there is nothing to contradict our good neighbourly and strategic relations . " " the cold war is over , " he added . maybe not entirely … but in rhetoric reminiscent of the decades-long east-west conflict , russian president vladimir putin launched a blistering attack on the united states , accusing it of running a " dictatorship " over global affairs and able only to worsen humanity 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , talks to indian prime minister manmohan singh during their joint press conference in new delhi friday , dec .
3 , 2004 .
his visit began with some pointed criticism of the united states .
on friday night in a speech delivered in new delhi , where he is on a state visit , putin warned against attempts to rebuild the modern system of international relations along the lines of a uni-polar world . rising single power dominance would also increase the " global threats of international terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , " the russian leader said . " only a balanced democratic system of international law , " could help ease those problems , he said . although he did not cite the united states by name , the target of his critique was certain . " even when dictatorship is beautifully gift-wrapped in pseudo-democratic phraseology it has never been capable of resolving such systemic problems .
on the contrary , it can only make them worse , " putin said . he also accused the west of practising double standards on terrorism and questioned whether fair elections could be held in iraq as violence persisted . cold war memories the cold war oratory has been amplified since the opposition movement in ukraine picked up momentum .
putin had strongly supported pro-government candidate viktor yanukovych during the campaign , even making appearances on ukrainian television .
analysts say the language that has been coming out of the kremlin over the past weeks is due to russia 's lost imperial ambitions and fear of western meddling in a region it considers under its own sphere of influence . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mediators converge in ukraine as election crisis rages poland 's president warned the political crisis in ukraine could snowball as european and russian mediators made ready for a second round of talks aimed at resolving ukraine 's flaming political crisis .

other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .

" if our chancellor announces something while he is abroad which goes against the vote of his own parliament he discredits the concept of separation of powers , " she said , adding : " this would not really be the promotion of democracy . " schröder begins a visit to china on sunday . human rights first ? nickels conceded that china had made progress since the embargo was slapped on in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre , but the ruling coalition of schröder 's social democrats and the greens had made respect for human rights an obligation for arms exports . the bundestag voted at the end of october in favour of the embargo being maintained and was followed by the european parliament in mid-november .
other eu countries , notably france , want the ban lifted , and government sources said schröder would also press for it in discussions with his european counterparts . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said thursday : " this is a very solemn , serious political issue .
we think it 's for the eu to make an early and appropriate decision .
it 's not for the chinese side to make any concessions . " schröder will meet in china with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao , who will also travel to the netherlands on december 8 for an annual china-eu meeting . big business china , unable to purchase advanced weapons from the united states , wants to buy them from europe and countries such as france and germany are believed to want to benefit from this likely lucrative trade .
the chinese government spends heavily on military hardware . zhang argued thursday that china and the eu have had " fruitful and effective " dialogue on human rights .
it was " natural " for the two sides to have differences on human rights but those differences could be resolved through dialog instead , she said . the ban was " incompatible with the reality of our strategic partnership " and resolving the issue will benefit the development of china-eu relations , she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business looks to future in asia this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- profile : gilberto rodriguez orejuela bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 09:27 gmt , saturday , 4 december 2004 profile : gilberto rodriguez orejuela gilberto rodriguez orejuela , once one of the world 's most powerful criminals , has been extradited to the us to face drug smuggling and money-laundering charges .
the bbc news website looks back at the life of crime of a colombian sought for more than a decade by washington .
gilberto rodriguez orejuela - together with his younger brother miguel - led the cali drugs cartel , at its height believed to be responsible for 80 % of the global cocaine trade .
he earned his nickname , the chess player , for his ability to stay ahead of his rivals and outwit the authorities .
but his luck ran out in 1995 , when police swooped on his luxury apartment in cali and reportedly found him crouching in a wardrobe .
at the time , extradition was banned in colombia and rodriguez orejuela probably believed he would serve his time and then walk free .
in fact , freedom came earlier than expected when a colombian judge decided to release him in 2002 for good behaviour .

dickens lived in rochester in kent as a child , returning for several years before his death in 1870 .
the town 's connections with the author have been marked through the christmas festival every year since 1988 .
the festival takes place on saturday and sunday , featuring parades , a carol concert and a visit from santa claus .
rochester has celebrated its links to dickens for many years , but in october the town 's dickens centre museum closed after visitor numbers fell .
' unique connections ' the local council said at the time it remained committed to paying tribute to its most famous son .
a medway council spokesman said : " medway has many links with dickens - not only with the author 's life but also with his work .
adaptations of dickens novels are still regularly shown on television " names for some of his most famous works were taken from local people and many medway buildings feature in his work too .
" these unique dickensian connections are celebrated through the dickensian christmas .
" this year is the 16th festival and it continues to flourish . "
among the highlights of this weekend 's festival are a grand parade through the town at 1200 gmt on both days and a candlelit parade each day at 1645 gmt .
a carol concert takes place at boley hill at 1700 gmt each day , while children can visit father christmas in rochester castle gardens throughout saturday and sunday .
the council is advising people to use public transport as it expects many visitors to the town , but a park and ride scheme has also been set up .

the club was put into administration on friday when its directors won a high court order due to its cash crisis .
the move has saved the debt-ridden club from liquidation , but the football league has said it will deduct ten league points from the team .
the club has said it will be appealing against this .
wrexham 's woes off the pitch were echoed in the fa cup second round on friday night when they were knocked out at scunthorpe in a 2-0 defeat .
news of a third party interested in buying the club emerged in the high court hearing in manchester , but directors would not be drawn on whether it was one of the original bids or a fresh offer .
administration facts administration means that a court-appointed accountant takes over the financial control of the club from its directors the administrator tries to find a settlement with the club 's creditors or to sell the club as a going concern in the last 11 seasons , 34 football league clubs have gone into administration , 12 since the collapse of itv digital as well as a 10-point deduction , new league rules will not allow clubs to be in administration for longer than 18 months or two successive seasons simon johnson , secretary of the 750-strong wrexham supporters trust , welcomed the prospect of a potential new bidder .
he said : " if that is the case , then we 're obviously desperate to meet this new bidder and to talk to him .
" we have a lot to offer and can see ways in which this club can move forward . "
mr johnson also welcomed the club 's decision to appeal against the football league 's move to deduct ten points from the club , which has seen it drop from 16th in league one to 22nd - last but two .
he said : " i think the rule was designed for a different kind of circumstances .
" it was designed to stop clubs from gambling on getting into the premiership and then writing off all their debts .
have your say on 606 your views on wrexham 's plight " if we have got a case , then its worth doing .
it 's not a question of whether we stay up or go down .
" with denis -lrb- smith -rrb- and the boys , we 're doing pretty well .
we 're in with a very good chance of staying up .
it 's the principle . "
wrexham fc owes £ 900,000 to the inland revenue and going into administration has held off liquidation .
former chairman mark guterman withdrew his latest offer to buy the club last month , claiming mr hamilton had refused to accept it within a reasonable time .
responding to that approach , mr hamilton said he did not consider the offer because he did not believe that mr guterman had the money and challenged him to name his financial backers .
the club has seven days to lodge an appeal against the points deduction , which would then be considered by an independent panel .

green msps chris ballance and eleanor scott were distributing postcards on saturday urging tesco to pay farmers a larger share of the retail price .
former dairy farmer john sherrell said the supermarket chain had a duty to " do right " by food producers .
however , tesco said it was a " strong supporter " of the milk industry and wants a sustainable future for farmers .
the protest forms part of a national campaign by pressure group farm .
farm , an independent organisation which represents farmers , said it wants to halt the decline in small dairy farms .
our aim is to work with our suppliers to create sustainable relationships with dairy farmers tesco spokeswoman mr ballance , msp for south scotland , joined campaigners at a tesco store in dumfries , while ms scott , msp for highlands and islands , campaigned in inverness .
she said : " consumers should be aware that supermarkets are paying very low prices for milk and are driving dairy farmers out of business .

john sherrell , a former dairy farmer and member of the farm campaign group , added : " tesco is immensely profitable - it is said to get one in £ 8 spent by uk shoppers .
with this power comes a responsibility to do right by the food producers on whom its profits are based . "
tesco said it was " one step removed " from the relationship between farmers and their processors .
a spokeswoman said : " tesco is british agriculture 's number one customer and a strong supporter of the uk milk industry .
delivery trucks " our aim is to work with our suppliers to create sustainable relationships with dairy farmers .
" we believe the most positive thing we can do is to continue to work with the supply chain to grow the amount of uk dairy products that we sell and develop new opportunities . "
on thursday , more than 250 protesting dairy farmers stopped delivery trucks from getting into asda 's distribution depot in falkirk .
they have been angry over the supermarket 's pricing policy , which they claim means farmers get paid less for milk , despite price rises at checkouts .
the farmers have called on customers to shop elsewhere and have threatened to picket shop doors .
asda said it had recently increased the amount it is paying producers .

on thursday , more than 250 protesting dairy farmers stopped delivery trucks from getting into asda 's distribution depot in falkirk .
they have been angry over the supermarket 's pricing policy , which they claim means farmers get paid less for milk , despite price rises at checkouts .
the farmers have called on customers to shop elsewhere and have threatened to picket shop doors .
asda said it had recently increased the amount it is paying producers .
