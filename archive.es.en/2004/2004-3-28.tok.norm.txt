11 terrorist attacks .
but not many firms are biting . making money off the potential that terrorism attacks like those in madrid could happen in germany as well is not a pleasant business . but following the 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. , a group of german insurance companies swooped in on what had until then been an unclaimed domestic market for terrorism insurance .
the attack on the world trade center had been unparalleled in the history of insurance and exposed the need for policies dealing specifically with damage related to terrorism attacks . enter extremus ag , a group made up of big-name german insurers including allianz ag , that officially opened up shop in november 2002 .
since then , extremus has extended 1,176 terrorism insurance policies , bringing in a total of € 105 million in earnings . their clients tend to mostly be in the construction or airline industry , according to the company , though extremus has also begung to find customers in the telecommunications , real estate and tourism sector . insurance need in an unpredictable realm the unpredictable nature of terrorism and its ever-changing targets make signing a policy a must for most companies . " the thought process of these groups is completely foreign to us , " said bruno gas , ceo of the group at a press conference last week .
" and because these groups are foreign to us , it 's adventurous to predict target countries , target sites and target objects . " rather , gas advocates his customers to be ready for anything , especially after the march 11 commuter train attacks that killed more than 190 .
the group insures airplanes , airports , high-rises , factory plants and other massive objects that normal insurers or the company ca n't handle on their own . the group will not insure against nuclear , chemical or biological weapons attacks .
policies start at € 25 million , the limit at which normal fire insurance policies stop .
demand far lower than anticipated but not many have heeded gas ' warnings .
at the press conference last week , extremus revealed for the second year in a row that the demand for terror insurance was not as great as anticipated . after initially predicting in 2002 earnings of € 300 million that could increase to € 500 million in the coming years , gas has been forced to ratchet down expectations for extremus .
income from the premiums will likely be 20 percent lower than 2003 . observes say the overall malaise in the german economy is to blame as is extremus ' policy of only insuring companies within germany .

a proposal by interior minister otto schily that would allow the government to kick suspected terrorists out of the country much quicker has won support across germany 's political spectrum . in the weeks since the terrorist attacks in madrid , germany 's politicians have been scrambling over themselves to come up with tougher anti-terrorism measures . calls to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed in the name of domestic security , or set up a department of " homeland security " like in america , are most likely set to fade away . but a proposal by interior minister otto schily to streamline the way in which germany deports suspected terrorists has won support from across the political spectrum .
the policy , agreed upon by the left-of-center governing coalition on friday , would give schily the decision to kick out suspected terrorists based on evidence brought against them and the level of threat to german security .
" if the police and intelligence services have knowledge that a person is a potential danger to our country , then we need to be able to deport him , " schily said in an interview with the berliner zeitung . until now , german states have been responsible for determing who stays and who goes . under the new plan , the federal administrative court would decide on deportation in cases of national security , according to government politicians , and the cases would not go before regional and administrative courts . opposition showing signs of support the social democratic-green party government coalition plans to introduce their proposal during bipartisan discussions on the country 's new immigration law next thursday . based on the statements of opposition politicians so far , they can expect a good reaction .
christian democratic union and christian social union leaders have praised schily 's plan as a step in the right direction . but some , like bavaria 's hardline interior minister gunther beckstein , want tougher measures .
not just the federal interior minister , but state ministers should be able to decide on whether or not to deport someone , said beckstein . germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution estimates that there are round 30,000 islamic extremists within the country , 4,000 of them are considered very dangerous . beckstein says the country needs to do more to fight this threat . " in all , we 're taking this on too lackadaisically , " said beckstein , who also demanded a federal registry of islamic radicals that law enforcement could turn to for help in investigations . schily : europe should use computer profiling other european countries have followed germany in re-evaluating anti-terrorism measures following the madrid bombings that killed 190 and injured thousands on march 11 .

11 terrorist attacks .
but not many firms are biting . making money off the potential that terrorism attacks like those in madrid could happen in germany as well is not a pleasant business . but following the 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. , a group of german insurance companies swooped in on what had until then been an unclaimed domestic market for terrorism insurance .
the attack on the world trade center had been unparalleled in the history of insurance and exposed the need for policies dealing specifically with damage related to terrorism attacks . enter extremus ag , a group made up of big-name german insurers including allianz ag , that officially opened up shop in november 2002 .
since then , extremus has extended 1,176 terrorism insurance policies , bringing in a total of € 105 million in earnings . their clients tend to mostly be in the construction or airline industry , according to the company , though extremus has also begung to find customers in the telecommunications , real estate and tourism sector . insurance need in an unpredictable realm the unpredictable nature of terrorism and its ever-changing targets make signing a policy a must for most companies . " the thought process of these groups is completely foreign to us , " said bruno gas , ceo of the group at a press conference last week .
" and because these groups are foreign to us , it 's adventurous to predict target countries , target sites and target objects . " rather , gas advocates his customers to be ready for anything , especially after the march 11 commuter train attacks that killed more than 190 .
the group insures airplanes , airports , high-rises , factory plants and other massive objects that normal insurers or the company ca n't handle on their own . the group will not insure against nuclear , chemical or biological weapons attacks .
policies start at € 25 million , the limit at which normal fire insurance policies stop .
demand far lower than anticipated but not many have heeded gas ' warnings .
at the press conference last week , extremus revealed for the second year in a row that the demand for terror insurance was not as great as anticipated . after initially predicting in 2002 earnings of € 300 million that could increase to € 500 million in the coming years , gas has been forced to ratchet down expectations for extremus .

but just what is the story ?
according to the news of the world , eriksson is poised to sign a new deal that would keep him in the england job until 2008 .
the paper quotes an fa insider who says an announcement is expected within days .
several other papers are convinced that a very different announcement is imminent - one confirming that eriksson will be chelsea 's manager next season .
warnings a bit of photographic trickery enables the sunday mirror to picture him pocketing a cheque from chelsea .
where the amount should be displayed it reads " as much as you like " .
another man whose career has been poured over by the press recently provides the lead story for the mail on sunday .
it reports that charles kennedy has been warned by senior liberal democrat mps about moves to replace him as leader with his deputy , sir menzies campbell .
at a meeting last week they apparently told mr kennedy he needed to stage a dramatic recovery to put an end to speculation about his health .
difficult break-up the front-page headline in the observer declares that gay couples are to be given " full rights to marriage " .
the article that follows fails to live up to this billing since the paper concedes that new laws being unveiled this week will stop short of allowing gay marriages .
but the paper says same-sex couples who sign an official register will be given many rights currently reserved for married couples , such as avoiding inheritance tax on property passed on when a partner dies .
breaking up will also become harder to do for those who sign the register - the courts will dissolve partnerships , as with marriages that end in divorce .
the observer believes it all amounts to one of the most significant changes to britain 's social make-up for 40 years .
controversy the sunday times claims a government immigration policy is allowing thousands of migrants to enter or settle in britain without proper checks .
it says a leaked document tells staff at the immigration service headquarters in south london to approve all applications that are over three months old unless information already on file supports a refusal .
the home office says this practice differs from a fast-tracking procedure adopted in sheffield , which caused considerable controversy .
the independent on sunday reports that britain 's polo fraternity is upset about an influx of extremely talented foreigners .
british players are apparently finding themselves consigned to the sidelines because the top teams are packed with skilful argentine players who hold italian citizenship and are therefore entitled to work here under eu rules .
mean streets a senior british player tells the paper he now has to combine playing polo with working as a part-time building labourer to keep his family - plus his string of horses - afloat .
the town of erith in kent may not be known for its mean streets but according to a new league table its residents are the meanest in britain .
researchers suggest that just 44 percent of households in erith give to two or more charities each year .
the sunday telegraph says the people of marlborough in wiltshire were found to be the most generous .

one woman whose ex-partner was jailed for murdering her baby daughter tells the bbc how she feels about it .
five years ago , lisa davis 's life suddenly fell apart .
she was called to the phone at the care home where she worked as an auxiliary nurse to be told that her 13-month-old daughter heidi was critically ill .
she rushed immediately to the nearby james paget hospital , great yarmouth , where the toddler was in intensive care .
there she found her tearful partner , lorry driver raymond rock , who said there had been a terrible accident .
heidi had wriggled out of his arms as he tried to comfort her and landed on the floor .
heidi had suffered extensive brain damage .
she died a few hours later .
arrested three days later , police officers came to arrest rock for heidi 's murder .
" i remember the day of his arrest vividly , " says lisa .
it 's possible that he is not guilty dr jennian geddes " it was monday morning and there were 10 police officers .
they said they had come to arrest him for heidi 's murder and i said : ' no , you 've made a mistake ' . "
a devastated lisa refused to believe the man she loved and trusted had shaken her baby so violently .
heidi 's injuries were likened to those of an adult who had been hurled into a wall at 70 mph .
one doctor subsequently told chelmsford crown court that heidi displayed all the classic signs of " shaken baby syndrome " - bleeding and trauma to the brain and eyes .
it was , he said , the worst case he had seen in 30 years of practice .
only when the jury returned their unanimous guilty verdict did lisa fully allow herself to believe that rock had murdered heidi .
" gradually , it started to sink in , " she says .
" the man i loved more than anything had killed my little girl .
it was like two losses at once . "
five years on , lisa is facing the prospect of her world being turned upside down once again .
appeal planned she may have to accept that 32-year-old rock is innocent and may be a victim of a miscarriage of justice .
the main prosecution evidence against rock was the agreement of several eminent experts that heidi had died of shaken baby syndrome .
there is no way he killed that baby brian rock but rock 's solicitors are currently preparing an appeal based on new research by a group of british doctors that directly contradicts the central thesis of sbs - that the ' tell-tale signs ' of bleeding to a child 's eyes and brain is definitive proof of violent shaking .
the dissenting doctors believe babies are far more vulnerable to brain damage than previously thought and that the so-called " tell-tale " signs can be caused by a seemingly innocuous fall of just a few feet - even from a bed or sofa - and can not be relied on as evidence of abuse .
" it 's possible that he is not guilty , " says dr jennian geddes , a leading neuropathologist .
" it 's entirely possible that people are in prison , convicted of violent shaking , who have in fact done nothing wrong . "
mike mackey , who represents sally clark - who was wrongly convicted of killing her two sons - shares that view .
" i am concerned that the experts on sbs might be wrong too , particularly those cases where there is very little or no other indicators of abuse , " he says .
meanwhile , rock who is currently in frankland prison , durham , maintains his innocence .
" there is no way he killed that baby , " says his father brian .
" it might be what any father would say of his son , but i know it is the truth . "
none of this will ever bring back heidi .
but last week , when i asked lisa about the new evidence that points to the fact that rock might be innocent , her answer was heartrending .
" well , if that 's so , they 've ruined my life , have n't they ?
" the last five years are going to be a complete and utter lie . "

one woman whose ex-partner was jailed for murdering her baby daughter tells the bbc how she feels about it .
five years ago , lisa davis 's life suddenly fell apart .
she was called to the phone at the care home where she worked as an auxiliary nurse to be told that her 13-month-old daughter heidi was critically ill .
she rushed immediately to the nearby james paget hospital , great yarmouth , where the toddler was in intensive care .
there she found her tearful partner , lorry driver raymond rock , who said there had been a terrible accident .
heidi had wriggled out of his arms as he tried to comfort her and landed on the floor .
heidi had suffered extensive brain damage .
she died a few hours later .
arrested three days later , police officers came to arrest rock for heidi 's murder .
" i remember the day of his arrest vividly , " says lisa .
it 's possible that he is not guilty dr jennian geddes " it was monday morning and there were 10 police officers .
they said they had come to arrest him for heidi 's murder and i said : ' no , you 've made a mistake ' . "
a devastated lisa refused to believe the man she loved and trusted had shaken her baby so violently .
heidi 's injuries were likened to those of an adult who had been hurled into a wall at 70 mph .
one doctor subsequently told chelmsford crown court that heidi displayed all the classic signs of " shaken baby syndrome " - bleeding and trauma to the brain and eyes .
it was , he said , the worst case he had seen in 30 years of practice .
only when the jury returned their unanimous guilty verdict did lisa fully allow herself to believe that rock had murdered heidi .
" gradually , it started to sink in , " she says .
" the man i loved more than anything had killed my little girl .
it was like two losses at once . "
five years on , lisa is facing the prospect of her world being turned upside down once again .
appeal planned she may have to accept that 32-year-old rock is innocent and may be a victim of a miscarriage of justice .
the main prosecution evidence against rock was the agreement of several eminent experts that heidi had died of shaken baby syndrome .
there is no way he killed that baby brian rock but rock 's solicitors are currently preparing an appeal based on new research by a group of british doctors that directly contradicts the central thesis of sbs - that the ' tell-tale signs ' of bleeding to a child 's eyes and brain is definitive proof of violent shaking .
the dissenting doctors believe babies are far more vulnerable to brain damage than previously thought and that the so-called " tell-tale " signs can be caused by a seemingly innocuous fall of just a few feet - even from a bed or sofa - and can not be relied on as evidence of abuse .
" it 's possible that he is not guilty , " says dr jennian geddes , a leading neuropathologist .
" it 's entirely possible that people are in prison , convicted of violent shaking , who have in fact done nothing wrong . "
mike mackey , who represents sally clark - who was wrongly convicted of killing her two sons - shares that view .
" i am concerned that the experts on sbs might be wrong too , particularly those cases where there is very little or no other indicators of abuse , " he says .
meanwhile , rock who is currently in frankland prison , durham , maintains his innocence .
" there is no way he killed that baby , " says his father brian .
" it might be what any father would say of his son , but i know it is the truth . "
none of this will ever bring back heidi .
but last week , when i asked lisa about the new evidence that points to the fact that rock might be innocent , her answer was heartrending .
" well , if that 's so , they 've ruined my life , have n't they ?
" the last five years are going to be a complete and utter lie . "

2004 is set to be a watershed year , when , for the first time , we will be snapping up more digital cameras than their analogue counterparts .
life through a lens has never been more exciting , judging from the range of digital cameras on show at the recent cebit technology show in hanover , germany .
over the past couple of years , manufacturers have been competing furiously to improve picture sharpness , or resolution , so much so that today even budget models have sensors capable of several megapixels .
in fact the so-called megapixel race has come on so quickly , that it is now running out of steam .
" end users do n't need more than four or five megapixel cameras , " said harold jutten of pentax .
" they see that that is enough for very good , high-resolution pictures .
i think pixel-mania has stopped . "
this means that the big players are competing on other territory , such as design .
for example one camera has an optical zoom lens , which , instead of coming out of the camera , moves up and down inside the chassis .
permanent memories new technologies are playing their part too , like a so-called optical image stabiliser which helps alleviate the effects of camera wobble and the resulting blurry photos .
there is also a push to get us printing our photos .
around eight out of 10 digital pictures are thought to never make it into printed form at all . "
the type of quality still picture you can get with a digital camcorder is not as good as a dedicated digital camera " brendon gore , panasonic " in the world of photography we 're dealing with emotional moments , it 's a memory. something i want to keep , " said patrick bluhme of kodak .
" i want to touch it , i want to feel it .
that 's even true in the digital world . "
you do not need a pc any more to join in the revolution .
if you are at home , simply docking your camera into a dedicated printer will do .
on the high street , watch out for retail kiosks where you put in your memory cards and see the results seconds later .
and with cameras making their way onto mobile phones , solutions are even appearing for diy printing while you are out and about .
the other noticeable trend is towards convergence .
many digital stills cameras offer video as a bonus , just do not expect great quality .
" you are definitely getting convergence , but there 's a difference in performance , " said brendon gore of panasonic .
" the type of quality still picture you can get with a digital camcorder is not as good as a dedicated digital camera . "
saving the past interestingly , it is the camcorder makers who seem to be taking convergence seriously .
some camcorders have better sensors so you can get higher resolution stills , and there is even one which has two lenses to cope with differing requirements .
more generally , though , the watchword in the camcorder world is evolution not revolution .
the main battleground is over recording formats .
a few players have gone the recordable dvd route .
" it 's much more easy to use , you get higher performance , you do n't get the degradation that you get with tape , if you want to go to a video clip you go straight to that clip through an icon , " said mark wilkin of hitachi .
the 8cm discs come in different varieties and not all will play back in a regular dvd player .
they are also more expensive and smaller than regular dvds , each storing 2.8 gb of data , only about 20 minutes of really high quality footage .
no surprise then that , for the time being , most manufacturers are sticking with tape-based systems .
but there has been progress on other fronts , in particular little features , which help us on our way to producing better movies , like enhanced filming mode .
" we 've added a feature which allows you to record in a very dark environment , but still you have colours in your picture , " said jean-baptiste duprieu of sony .
at the end of the day though , there is no getting away from the bare facts .
if you are hopeless behind the lens , not even technology can save you .

the country 's vehicle fleet is now more than 12 times larger than in 1990 , and many private cars are elderly and so poorly maintained they are a menace .
the government is planning to introduce countrywide pollution checks in the hope of protecting people 's health .
but critics suspect it may be too easy to sidestep them , and want a total ban on imports of old and dangerous cars .
when the communist dictator enver hoxha died in 1985 there were about 2,000 cars in the whole of albania .
by 1990 the country 's entire fleet of road vehicles numbered something like 15,000 . "
it would n't be difficult for the government to pass a law banning all imports of old and stolen cars - and it 's a fact that most of the cars here have been stolen " edi rama tirana mayor today , the government says , there are more than 200,000 cars alone , a figure rising by about 10,000 annually .
agron deliu , of the ministry of health 's institute of environmental studies , said the 90 % of albania 's cars which were more than nine years old produced most of the pollution .
over 80 % of them are diesel-powered , and poorly maintained diesel engines emit large quantities of microscopic particles , called pm10s , which can lodge deep in the lungs and are carcinogenic .
the world health organization limit for pm10s is 50 microgrammes per cubic metre of air , but at one central tirana crossroads the 24-hour average exposure was 483 micrograms , with peak-hour levels far higher .
mr deliu said : " our health ca n't cope with this .
in some parts of tirana the mortality rate has risen by 20 % in a decade .
air pollution - and in the cities 90 % of it is from vehicles - is very threatening now . "
another problem is leaded petrol , used by most of the 40,000 or so petrol-driven cars .
although it is a potent health threat , especially to the mental development of infants and children , in albania it is cheaper than unleaded fuel -lrb- where that is available at all -rrb- .
there are no routine tests for lead levels in children 's blood .
mr deliu also said italy was exporting to albania fuel too high in sulphur to be sold domestically or anywhere within the european union .
the government plans to introduce a vehicle testing scheme in 2005 to get the worst polluters off the road .
it will check not just mechanical features like brakes and lights but also emissions of pollutants .
the environment minister , et 'hem ruka , said : " pollution in tirana has got far worse in the last three years , and we 're very concerned about it . "
but many albanians think their country 's endemic corruption will easily find a way round any new system .
one told bbc news online : " come on - if you do n't want your car to fail the check , all you 'll need to do is find a few dollars and you 'll be ok . "
the mayor of tirana , edi rama , thinks there is a simpler way to limit pollution anyway .
he said : " it would n't be difficult for the government to pass a law banning all imports of old and stolen cars - and it 's a fact that most of the cars here have been stolen .
these are simple steps : why does n't the government act ? "

it would n't be difficult for the government to pass a law banning all imports of old and stolen cars - and it 's a fact that most of the cars here have been stolen edi rama tirana mayor today , the government says , there are more than 200,000 cars alone , a figure rising by about 10,000 annually .
agron deliu , of the ministry of health 's institute of environmental studies , said the 90 % of albania 's cars which were more than nine years old produced most of the pollution .
over 80 % of them are diesel-powered , and poorly maintained diesel engines emit large quantities of microscopic particles , called pm10s , which can lodge deep in the lungs and are carcinogenic .
the world health organization limit for pm10s is 50 microgrammes per cubic metre of air , but at one central tirana crossroads the 24-hour average exposure was 483 micrograms , with peak-hour levels far higher .
cars left overnight acquire a coating of filth mr deliu said : " our health ca n't cope with this .
in some parts of tirana the mortality rate has risen by 20 % in a decade .
air pollution - and in the cities 90 % of it is from vehicles - is very threatening now . "
another problem is leaded petrol , used by most of the 40,000 or so petrol-driven cars .
although it is a potent health threat , especially to the mental development of infants and children , in albania it is cheaper than unleaded fuel -lrb- where that is available at all -rrb- .
there are no routine tests for lead levels in children 's blood .
mr deliu also said italy was exporting to albania fuel too high in sulphur to be sold domestically or anywhere within the european union .
the government plans to introduce a vehicle testing scheme in 2005 to get the worst polluters off the road .
brightly painted streets can not hide the problem it will check not just mechanical features like brakes and lights but also emissions of pollutants .
the environment minister , et 'hem ruka , said : " pollution in tirana has got far worse in the last three years , and we 're very concerned about it . "
but many albanians think their country 's endemic corruption will easily find a way round any new system .
one told bbc news online : " come on - if you do n't want your car to fail the check , all you 'll need to do is find a few dollars and you 'll be ok . "
the mayor of tirana , edi rama , thinks there is a simpler way to limit pollution anyway .
he said : " it would n't be difficult for the government to pass a law banning all imports of old and stolen cars - and it 's a fact that most of the cars here have been stolen .
these are simple steps : why does n't the government act ? "
