voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .

police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .

the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .
nevertheless , security is to be increased , notably on trains and on borders with non-eu countries , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow . " unsubstantiated reports suggest the along with a number of detonators , an arabic tape was found in a stolen van that was found by police near the route of the trains . however , interior minister angel acebes said that " none of the intelligence services ... have provided reliable information to the effect that it could have been an islamic terrorist organisation .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .

if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .
the prime minister is leaving nothing to chance and has insisted upon daily inspections of athens arena building site . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government faces olympic challenge following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .

when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .
the prime minister is leaving nothing to chance and has insisted upon daily inspections of athens arena building site . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government faces olympic challenge following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .

after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .
nevertheless , security is to be increased , notably on trains and on borders with non-eu countries , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .
government officials meanwhile rejected this , saying enough security was already in place .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow . " unsubstantiated reports suggest the along with a number of detonators , an arabic tape was found in a stolen van that was found by police near the route of the trains . however , interior minister angel acebes said that " none of the intelligence services ... have provided reliable information to the effect that it could have been an islamic terrorist organisation .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2004 germany calls for urgent european summit on terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily called for an eu " common assessment " of a new terror threat .
germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .
nevertheless , security is to be increased , notably on trains and on borders with non-eu countries , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .
government officials meanwhile rejected this , saying enough security was already in place .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .
the prime minister is leaving nothing to chance and has insisted upon daily inspections of athens arena building site . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government faces olympic challenge following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .

many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .

the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2004 germany calls for urgent european summit on terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily called for an eu " common assessment " of a new terror threat .
germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2004 germany calls for urgent european summit on terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily called for an eu " common assessment " of a new terror threat .
germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .
nevertheless , security is to be increased , notably on trains and on borders with non-eu countries , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .
government officials meanwhile rejected this , saying enough security was already in place .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .

many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on .

as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .
the government is blaming the separatist group eta .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .

spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .
nevertheless , security is to be increased , notably on trains and on borders with non-eu countries , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow . " unsubstantiated reports suggest the along with a number of detonators , an arabic tape was found in a stolen van that was found by police near the route of the trains . however , interior minister angel acebes said that " none of the intelligence services ... have provided reliable information to the effect that it could have been an islamic terrorist organisation .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .
the prime minister is leaving nothing to chance and has insisted upon daily inspections of athens arena building site . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government faces olympic challenge following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .

calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow . " unsubstantiated reports suggest the along with a number of detonators , an arabic tape was found in a stolen van that was found by police near the route of the trains . however , interior minister angel acebes said that " none of the intelligence services ... have provided reliable information to the effect that it could have been an islamic terrorist organisation .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .
the phone was inside a bag containing one of the bombs which failed to explode . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring spain 's dead as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on .

the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow . " unsubstantiated reports suggest the along with a number of detonators , an arabic tape was found in a stolen van that was found by police near the route of the trains . however , interior minister angel acebes said that " none of the intelligence services ... have provided reliable information to the effect that it could have been an islamic terrorist organisation .

the new greek government has assured the jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year . it has been a long running saga of " will they or wo n't they " but after a meeting between the new greek prime minister costas karamanlis and jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , on saturday the tale of athens and the summer olympic games 2004 may have a happy ending after all .
rogge traveled to the greek capital to test the resolve of the new conservative administration to complete the construction of olympic venues and related infrastructure on time .
and after discussions with karamanlis , athens mayor dora bakoyanni , and designers and construction officials , rogge said that he is confident greece will complete the work for this summer 's games on time and that he expected the games to be a success .
new leader takes personal responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas karamanlis .
the main reason for the ioc chief 's upbeat message appears to be the fact that prime minister karamanlis -lrb- photo -rrb- has taken personal charge of the preparations .
karamanlis has put his personal reputation and political future on the line by appointing himself minister in charge of the olympics : " for us , it is a great relief and for us it is a great satisfaction .
when you work with a team , it 's always easy if the boss is taking responsibility .
yes , it 's going to make a difference of course , " rogge told reporters outside the prime minister 's residence .
despite the words of confidence , rogge still remains concerned that greece 's preparations for the olympics are still badly behind schedule .
in particular , the ioc chief is concerned about serious delays in preparing the high-tech steel and glass roof of the main olympic stadium , which is designed to be the architectural focal point of the games in athens .
rogge had recently given the greeks a chance of backing out of finishing the avant-garde roof of the main olympic stadium , which has been bedeviled by construction problems , and save face , saying that the games could go ahead without it .
greeks hold firm on architectural jewel however , that was not an option for the proud greeks who have held up the retractable steel and glass cover , designed by spaniard santiago calatrava , as the architectural jewel of the 2004 games and the symbol of national pride .
calatrava had been summoned to athens to discuss the lack of progress shortly after the new government took office and , after talks with the deputy culture minister , it was announced that the roof would not be abandoned .
after the talks , calatrava - who tried to escape from reporters through a back door - finally declared to the throng who cornered him that everything was going very well with this magnificent installation .
other concerns that have given the ioc headaches include the installation of new railway lines and tramways which have also fallen behind schedule .
two week deadline for assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques rogge .
at the end of saturday 's meeting , rogge -lrb- photo -rrb- gave the greek government two weeks to study a list of faults in its olympic build-up and prepare a response with solutions and time frames for rectification for the next time they have contact .
although most of the problems have occurred during the governance of the former socialist administration , which was roundly defeated in last sunday 's greek general election , rogge refused to criticize those ultimately responsible for the delays and said it was not upto the greek people to work with their new administration to get the construction work finished and the details fine tuned to make the athens games the success the city deserves .
prime minister orders daily checks athens mayor dora bakoyanni told reporters as she left the meeting that under the new conservative government the building work would definitely speed up .
karamanlis is seeing to it personally that this is the case .
the prime minister is leaving nothing to chance and has insisted upon daily inspections of athens arena building site . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government faces olympic challenge following sunday 's victory for the greek conservative party , greece faces a change in government just months before it hosts the olympic games .

the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .

the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .

as the polling stations open across spain for sunday 's election , the funerals for those who died in the madrid terrorist attacks go on . after the shock and horror came anger and defiance .
in the streets of madrid on friday , a day after spain 's worst ever terrorist attack which left nearly 200 people dead and many more injured , the people of the spanish capital demanded answers and took to the streets to show that while the nation remained numb from the atrocity , they would not cower in their homes . spain is engulfed in a wave of emotion after the first funerals for victims of the bombings took place on saturday . the first funeral masses took place in alcala de henares , the commuter town east of madrid .
lying 15 miles from the capital , alcala de hanares sees many of its workers and students leave for madrid each day on the trains that until thursday brought them safely to their jobs and places of education and back again . all the trains that were bombed either started their journeys at alcala or passed through on their way to madrid .
as a result , an estimated 1100 people from the town were on board at the time of the explosions . everyone knows a victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the dead began to be laid to rest on saturday , forty funerals alone took place in alcala for those who fell victim .
many of those who attended were not only the grieving relatives and friends of those who lost their lives but also many of the 120 townspeople injured ; those fellow travellers who survived . in the old university town of 190,000 inhabitants - now made up mostly of working class people and immigrants from eastern europe and south america who have escaped the spiralling house prices in madrid - everyone knows a victim . as the official period of mourning creeps onto the day of the spanish elections , the sports hall which was due to act as a polling station will instead continue to act as a makeshift morgue as the slow process of laying the bodies to rest begins in earnest . life goes on in alcala the railway station at alcala was mostly deserted on friday , with station staff telling reporters that they estimated only ten percent of commuters had turned up for their trains to work .
those who had stood nervously , some in tears , according to reports , waiting to test their self determination to get on a train once more . encarnacion moreno , an office cleaner , steeling herself for her daily trip into madrid , told british newspaper the guardian : " of course we are scared , but life has to go on . "
she added that those responsible should be caught and hanged in the center of the capital for all to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see these people day in , day out and have become friends with some of them , " andres zuya , a newsagent on alcala station told reporters .
" but today there is nobody here .
i will find out next week which of my regulars wo n't be coming back . " madrid swells with protest many of those who faced going to work on friday went by car and bus into a capital city already bulging with congestion .
as well as increased road traffic , madrid was swelled with huge crowds of people , estimated at around two million , who turned out despite heavy rain , clutching umbrellas , flags and posters to denounce terrorism , some shouting " assassins " and " a people united will never be defeated " . a six-lane motorway through the capital was also closed off to allow demonstrators to march to the railway station at atocha where the worst of the attacks took place .
across the grieving nation , vigils and rallies brought another six million people out onto the streets of towns and cities - including those in the basque country , the home of separatist group eta , the suspected perpetrators . eta remains number one suspect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , despite the fact that the imminent elections suggest that the basque separatists carried out the atrocities , there is little evidence as yet to positively identify who was responsible for the coordinated attacks .
eta has previously targeted the spanish railway system and two eta suspects were arrested last month driving a truck loaded with explosives headed for madrid . but after the group issued their denial , a statement was sent to a london-based newspaper claiming that al qaeda was behind the bombings , and some arab commentators in london said they believed it to be genuine . islamic group claims responsibility a message purportedly from the abu hafs al-masri brigades said it had attacked " america 's ally in its war against islam " on behalf of al-qaeda .
the statement read : " the death squad succeeded in penetrating the european crusader depths and striking one of the pillars of the crusader alliance - spain - with a painful blow . " unsubstantiated reports suggest the along with a number of detonators , an arabic tape was found in a stolen van that was found by police near the route of the trains . however , interior minister angel acebes said that " none of the intelligence services ... have provided reliable information to the effect that it could have been an islamic terrorist organisation .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .
airport style security at railway stations , for example , would bring the network to a standstill , he said .
the interior minister said he saw no reason for the moment to suspend the schengen agreement , which allows travel throughout much of the eu without border checks .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .

al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .

the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .

voting continues across spain in the country 's parliamentary election .
the ruling popular party is facing opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks . small groups of demonstrators continued to shout slogans outside the offices of the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- in the spanish capital of madrid as the sun rose on the bloodied nation 's parliamentary election day .
the protestors shouted " we want the truth " and " peace , " and carried banners accusing the government of lying over responsibility for the bomb attacks that killed 200 people in madrid .
on saturday , between 6,000 and 7,000 people gathered to continue the mass protests that started in the immediate wake of the bombings on thursday .
many protestors spent the night outside the party headquarters .
meanwhile the spanish electoral commission said it had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the popular party claiming that the protests constituted a bid to influence voters on the eve of the election .
the bombings have complicated an election which looked to be running smoothly for the pp .
it seemed to be a foregone conclusion .
up until thursday morning , spain 's parliamentary election would see the ruling popular party retain power .
now , after the bomb attacks in madrid , a predicted outcome for sunday 's election is far from cut and dried . before march 11 , the main topic of conversation apart from whether madrid 's footballers would overcome bayern munich in their crunch european tie , was not if mariano rajoy , the newly installed pp leader , would win but by how much .
in fact , unanimous surveys of public opinion had josé maria aznar 's hand-picked successor already installed as spanish prime minister with the only gray area being whether the 48-year-old would be ruling with an absolute majority or not . a very different political climate but those opinions were from a populace which at the time had an unshaking belief that they would wake up on monday morning and everything would be as it was before the people of spain went to the polls , with the popular party in control .
now , that belief has been rattled by violence and carnage and spain is now a nation torn apart by bombs and grief .
the election is now very hard to call . however , while the result may now be thrown into as much confusion as the spanish way of life currently is , thursday 's bombs are expected to prompt spain 's voters to turn out in their millions for elections on sunday . according to charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute , spaniards will vote in droves in a bid to have their voices heard .
" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " he told bbc news online . voters expected in massive numbers " people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 percent , " he said . professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , added his own thoughts to the discussion .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting . " before thursday , the ruling popular party enjoyed a slender but consolidated lead over the spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
that lead was estimated to be one of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition .
this poll , however , could not possibly take into consideration the effect the deaths of 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid could have on the standings . eta factor could force a stronger hand the vote could be swayed by any evidence that could pin responsibility on the perpetrators .
if investigators uncover strong links to the basque separatist organization eta , experts believe the voters could show their anger by giving the pp , which has campaigned on a strong line against the separatists , its strongest victory yet .
" assuming it was eta , the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters . however , if the claim of the al qaeda affiliated abu hafs al-masri brigades that it carried out the attacks is proved to be correct , then that could lead to a very different reaction .
" if it was an islamic extremist group like , everything would change , " said professor mezo . islamic involvement may damage government " if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . " " but , in fact , it looks like we wo n't know for a while who did this .
and unless concrete proof is found before sunday , i believe things will stay much the same - the pp will win , but there will still be significant support for both parties . " the consequence of confirmed al qaeda involvement could be that spain 's young left-wingers , who so vocally opposed the war in iraq , drop their current policy of abstention in votes due to lack of belief in the left parties and register protest votes against the pp , tilting the balance of power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish pm vows to catch bombers spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has vowed to catch those responsible for the madrid train bombings thursday morning that killed 190 and injured more than 1,240 .

germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists . after a meeting of germany 's " security cabinet " on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for an emergency eu security conference to discuss ways to respond to what he called " a potentially new scale of terrorist threat " in the wake of the deadly madrid bombings .
schily told reports that germany would put the motion to ireland , which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , and ask that the meeting of european union interior ministers and security chiefs convene within a week .
schily said that growing indications that the attacks in madrid were the work of islamic militants showed that there was growing and wider threat to european union nations and that interior ministers and security and police chiefs needed to draft a " common assessment " on how to cope with the ever-changing rules of engagement in the war against terror .
some 200 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the coordinated bombings on commuter trains in the spanish capital on thursday .
basque separatist movement eta was first believed to be responsible for the attacks .
al qaeda claim seems credible but a written statement released shortly after the bombings and a recently recovered video of a man speaking in arabic , claiming that that attacks had been carried out in retaliation for spain 's support of washington suggests that the claims of a group affiliated to al qaeda may be more credible than first thought .
any confirmation that al qaeda was to blame rather than eta would mean that the threat to other countries was heightened , schily said .
" if it is confirmed that the madrid attacks have an islamic background , then it means that islamic terrorism in europe has taken on a new quality . "
although he insisted an eta connection could not be ruled out , schily said the theory that al qaeda was responsible must be taken " very seriously . "
" we need to have clear and comprehensive information " to draw up a " common assessment " of the threat and " coordinate how to respond " , he added .
arrest of suspects prompts meeting usually a secret body that includes chancellor gerhard schroeder and senior ministers , including schily and foreign minister joschka fischer and the chiefs of the federal crime agency and of the foreign and domestic intelligence services , the security cabinet was summoned to the chancellor 's offices after spain made five arrests of non-spaniards on saturday evening .
the men , who spanish police suspect have links to extremist moroccan organizations , were arrested in connection with stolen telephony equipment that was found in a bag along with an explosive device that failed to go off by a train track in madrid .
schily told the press conference that moroccan security officials were already in spain .
" we have certain background information which may allow conclusions to be drawn about a possible link with the attack in casablanca , " he said in reference to an attack on a spanish restaurant last may which killed 45 people .
no new , specific threat to germany the interior minister was quick to assure the reporters that he saw no new specific threat to germany , but pointed out that the country had been mentioned as a possible target in previous al qaeda messages .
as for new and tighter security measures , schily reiterated his statements made at thew time of the bombings by saying that is was " illusory " to think that all possible targets could be protected .

an alleged al qaeda video claiming responsibility for thursday 's terror attacks in madrid has been found by police .
spain 's ruling popular party now faces growing anger from people demanding the truth about the bombings . the discovery of an alleged videotape suggesting al qaeda was behind thursday 's attacks in spain has heaped pressure on the incumbent popular party government as millions of spaniards go to the polls in sundays parliamentary elections .
the videotape features a man calling himself abu dujan al-afgani and claiming to be al qaeda 's military spokesman in europe .
he speaks arabic with a moroccan accent and claims the attacks which killed 200 people in madrid were revenge for spain 's " collaboration with the criminals bush and his allies " , according to angel acebes , the spanish interior minister .
the man mentions iraq and afghanistan in particular and warns that more violence is to come if " injustices " against the arab world do not come to an end .
" you want life and we want death , " the man reportedly says .
police also revealed that the tape was found during a search following an anonymous tip-off to a madrid broadcaster .
people say government to quick to blame eta the tape has yet to be verified as authentic but already it is causing a backlash against the government which some spaniards are accusing of being too quick to blame the basque separatist movement eta in the immediate wake of the attacks .
if the tape is proved to be the real thing and that radical islamic extremists affiliated with al qaeda were responsible for the bombings , it could prove very damaging to a party whose former leader jose maria aznar aligned spain with the united states and britain on iraq in the face of major opposition .
the spanish government backed the us-led invasion last year despite polls showing 90 percent opposition to it from the spanish public .
basque-islamic collaboration not ruled out meanwhile , eta has still not been ruled out of the investigation .
according to spanish foreign minister ana palacio , the basque separatist group is still a strong suspect and that spanish police were not ruling out other possibilities , including a possible collaboration between eta and al qaeda .
" i would say that anything is possible in this dark , dark world of terrorists , " palacio said in an interview on british television on sunday .
five held on suspicion of involvement the police investigation into the attacks has lead to five men with suspected links with extremist moroccan groups being held , the spanish interior minister told reporters on saturday , but he added that it was still too early to confirm this .
the men were arrested in connection with the sale and falsification of a mobile phone and sim card found by police near one of the bomb blasts on thursday .

" one thing no-one will dispute is that we are now likely to see a massive turnout , " said charles powell , senior european affairs analyst at the madrid-based think tank the elcano royal institute .
" people are angry and upset , and they will demonstrate that by voting .
it was going to be high anyway , but now i 'd estimate it will be over 80 % , " he told bbc news online .
professor juan pablo fusi , historian at madrid university , concurred .
" these bombs are likely to increase turnout - to show that they agree with the government that the only way to defeat terrorism is through democracy , by voting , " he told bbc news online .
who gains ?
there is less consensus on which party will benefit .
the most recent polls suggested a narrowing lead for the ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , now led by mariano rajoy , the hand-picked successor of prime minister jose maria aznar .
now is a time to put all differences aside and to unite the wills of all spaniards mariano rajoy pp leader profile : mariano rajoy it was estimated to have a lead of 4.5 percentage points over the opposition spanish socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
but that poll was taken three days before thursday 's attacks , which killed nearly 200 people aboard packed rush-hour trains in madrid .
and the news of the arrest of three moroccans and two indians , and that a videotape has been found in which al-qaeda purportedly claims responsibility for the attacks , could muddy the waters even further .
it had generally been accepted that if eta was to blame the ruling party would benefit because of its uncompromising stance against the basque separatists .
" the obvious emotional interpretation is this will make people back the party with the toughest line against them , " politics professor josu mezo told reuters news agency .
whichever government is in power the terrorists will be hunted down to answer for their gruesome actions jose luis rodriguez zapatero psoe leader profile : jose luis rodriguez zapatero however , though the involvement of islamists in the bombings is far from proven , the bbc 's katya adler in madrid says that increasing indications of this involvement could cost the government dearly .
" the key point is evidence , " said professor fusi .
" if it is al-qaeda , many people may establish a connection with spain 's participation in the invasion of iraq and vote against the government . "
prediction ' impossible ' but another factor could see a significant swing to the socialists , says mr powell .
we 've never had anything as terrible as this , it 's impossible to say how the spanish people will react juan diez analyst " if al-qaeda is found to be involved , it could induce young left-wingers - who opposed the war in iraq , but tend to abstain at the moment because of dissatisfaction with the left-wing parties - to go out and vote ... and that could tilt the balance . "
for other analysts , prediction is impossible in the face of these attacks , the worst carnage on spanish soil since the 1936-39 civil war .

looking out of the office window , staff at fothergill & co were not shocked to see a seal 's head bobbing in the water , oblivious to the passing traffic near richmond bridge .
structural engineer richard philips , who caught the richmond seal on film , said it indicated the change he has seen in the thames over the past 30 years .
" occasionally after you have heavy rain , some less than pleasant stuff gets washed in , " he said .
" there 's a bit of flotsam and jetsam on the surface , but apart from that it 's remarkable .
" i have been rowing since the mid-70s and back then there were times when you would go and be ploughing through oil slicks - none of that is there now . "
but he appears to be in the minority .
those monitoring the river find that while it is well-regarded internationally - its success comes as a surprise closer to home .
" -lsb- the thames -rsb- is actually an environmental success story but it 's not well known in this country , " said steve colclough , a fisheries specialist at the environment agency " people see a few bits of floating plastic which are unsightly and they assume it 's pollution .
among world 's cleanest " we have had a recovery but the public does not realise it . "
to the untrained eye it might appear to be a moving mud bath , but the water has improved enough to sustain 121 species of fish .
in 1960 , a 20-year project began to extend london 's major sewage treatment works and improve river quality .
now the thames is one of the cleanest metropolitan estuaries in the world .
it is a sea change from 1957 , when the natural history museum declared it " biologically dead " or incapable of supporting life .
the red-bellied piranha which landed on a " thames bubbler " now teeming with life - including large nurseries of dover sole , sea bass , oysters , cockle fisheries and some salmon - it reportedly supports the most diverse ecosystem of all europe 's metropolitan estuaries .
from the estuarine prawn at battersea , the perch in putney eastwards to woolwich 's thick-lipped mullet and the five-bearded rockling at erith , the river is crawling with creatures .
seals have been spotted as far up as waterloo bridge while dolphins and porpoises surface in the late summer and autumn .
and the burrowing chinese mitten crab , which runs " like a spider " across the river bed , has been wreaking havoc on the banks of the thames for some time .
" we often get calls from people in lewisham or somewhere else saying : ' am i seeing things ?
there 's a dead crab in the river ' , " said mr colclough .
we often get calls from people in lewisham saying : ' am i seeing things ?
there 's a crab in the river steve colclough , environment agency last year the drinking water inspectorate informed us london had among the best quality tap water , largely drawn from the thames , in the country .
and coca cola obviously agrees - it purifies tap water from sidcup , just down the road from peckham , for its new dasani drink .
but for those who just can not shake the image of a murky thames seeping through westminster , mr philips suggests walking along just that bit further .
" people look at the river and what they see is mud .
" but the colour is dictated by the silt suspended in the water .
" at the top and bottom of the tide the silt does settle for a short period and then it 's quite clear .
the river is remarkably clean . "

looking out of the office window , staff at fothergill & co were not shocked to see a seal 's head bobbing in the water , oblivious to the passing traffic near richmond bridge .
structural engineer richard philips , who caught the richmond seal on film , said it indicated the change he has seen in the thames over the past 30 years .
" occasionally after you have heavy rain , some less than pleasant stuff gets washed in , " he said .
" there 's a bit of flotsam and jetsam on the surface , but apart from that it 's remarkable .

now the thames is one of the cleanest metropolitan estuaries in the world .
it is a sea change from 1957 , when the natural history museum declared it " biologically dead " or incapable of supporting life .
the red-bellied piranha which landed on a " thames bubbler " now teeming with life - including large nurseries of dover sole , sea bass , oysters , cockle fisheries and some salmon - it reportedly supports the most diverse ecosystem of all europe 's metropolitan estuaries .
from the estuarine prawn at battersea , the perch in putney eastwards to woolwich 's thick-lipped mullet and the five-bearded rockling at erith , the river is crawling with creatures .

looking out of the office window , staff at fothergill & co were not shocked to see a seal 's head bobbing in the water , oblivious to the passing traffic near richmond bridge .
structural engineer richard philips , who caught the richmond seal on film , said it indicated the change he has seen in the thames over the past 30 years .
" occasionally after you have heavy rain , some less than pleasant stuff gets washed in , " he said .
" there 's a bit of flotsam and jetsam on the surface , but apart from that it 's remarkable .
" i have been rowing since the mid-70s and back then there were times when you would go and be ploughing through oil slicks - none of that is there now . "
but he appears to be in the minority .
those monitoring the river find that while it is well-regarded internationally - its success comes as a surprise closer to home .
" -lsb- the thames -rsb- is actually an environmental success story but it 's not well known in this country , " said steve colclough , a fisheries specialist at the environment agency " people see a few bits of floating plastic which are unsightly and they assume it 's pollution .
among world 's cleanest " we have had a recovery but the public does not realise it . "
to the untrained eye it might appear to be a moving mud bath , but the water has improved enough to sustain 121 species of fish .
in 1960 , a 20-year project began to extend london 's major sewage treatment works and improve river quality .
now the thames is one of the cleanest metropolitan estuaries in the world .
it is a sea change from 1957 , when the natural history museum declared it " biologically dead " or incapable of supporting life .
the red-bellied piranha which landed on a " thames bubbler " now teeming with life - including large nurseries of dover sole , sea bass , oysters , cockle fisheries and some salmon - it reportedly supports the most diverse ecosystem of all europe 's metropolitan estuaries .
from the estuarine prawn at battersea , the perch in putney eastwards to woolwich 's thick-lipped mullet and the five-bearded rockling at erith , the river is crawling with creatures .
seals have been spotted as far up as waterloo bridge while dolphins and porpoises surface in the late summer and autumn .
and the burrowing chinese mitten crab , which runs " like a spider " across the river bed , has been wreaking havoc on the banks of the thames for some time .
" we often get calls from people in lewisham or somewhere else saying : ' am i seeing things ?
there 's a dead crab in the river ' , " said mr colclough .

the hi-tech way to enjoy back seat entertainment long gone are the days when puzzle books and coloured pens would keep a child happy in the back seat .
even a car radio causes conflict between young and old .
it is not surprising that 30 % of all high-end passenger vehicles now come with a video screen option .
sometimes they are attached to multiple dvd changers , so that passengers can watch their own individual movie .
satellite tv has also grown beyond the living room , thanks to advances in receiver technology .
" the way it works is , it 's a phased array antenna , " said martin kits van heyningen of kvh industries .
" what that means is that there are hundreds of tiny little antenna elements that are all connected together in phase , and they track the satellite .
" we actually have a gyroscope in the product , which detects the motion of the vehicle and compensates for it .
if you 're driving down the highway , going up and down hills , making sharp corners , our antenna actually tracks the satellite and stays locked on . "
one drawback of the system is that it does not work well in tunnels and skyscraper-saturated cities .
but when the video system is down , you can always listen to tunes from a central mp3 hard drive , which can occasionally be synched with the family pc .
video debate following an overall trend in auto technology , many headphones are wireless .
visible cables in a car are dangerous and unsightly .
and saving space in vehicles is also a priority .
we work very hard with individual states in the us to make sure that none of the laws exclude driving aid screens matt swanston , consumer electronics association .
" we 're employing overhead units , headrest units , with slots for all the different memory stick devices or the visual medium , " said david shalam of audiovox electronics .
" we 're also building in 20gb hard drives now you can take your home movies , and potentially other dvds , record them onto a disc , record them onto a unit and keep them in the car .
now you do n't actually have to bring in the dvd or the discs . "
dazzling , intriguing , creative are just some of the words that could be used to describe the technology you can find in show cars at exhibitions .
but ultimately it may not be the automotive , or for that matter the consumer electronics industry , that decide just how far all this goes .
it may come down to lawmakers .
there is an ongoing debate about video screens in the front of the car .
voice options many states ban them for entertainment purposes , but allow navigation aids , despite accusations that anything that visually distracts a driver is potentially life-threatening .
boring car journeys could be a thing of the past " we work very hard with individual states in the us to make sure that none of the laws exclude driving aid screens , " said matt swanston of the consumer electronics association .
" a lot of it is voice-controlled and voice-interactive as well , the navigation systems , for example . "
but voice technology is far from perfect , and a screen can also be a life-saver .
a rear view mirror can be connected to a video camera on the back bumper , or simply show an image of the backseat , obviously of potential use for baby monitoring .

the new chapter that general elections are supposed to bring came three days early with the bomb attacks on commuter trains in madrid .
elections or no elections , the future will always be post-11 march not post-14 march .
one of the country 's leading dailies , el pais , summed up the mood when it said : " it is inevitable that the elections will take into account the situation created by the attacks " .
spaniards are grieving , still recoiling from stunned disbelief , but they are also angry .
at the peace demonstrations on friday , millions across spain directed that anger at the bombers who left 200 dead and more than 1,000 injured .
the protest was a symbol that they would not be broken by terror .
' dubious ' turn-out for the polls - which was 68 % in 2000 - is expected to be higher this year as voters reinforce that message that bombs can not break their democracy .
the interior minister promised total transparency in the investigation but the governing popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which had been widely expected to win , has also been a target for that anger and frustration .
at the peace marches and at " spontaneous " protests outside pp headquarters in madrid on saturday , thousands demanded " who was it ?
tell us the truth " and held up banners warning " do n't play with the dead " .
el pais referred to " the more than dubious attitude of the government in relation to the lines of investigation " .
and protesters accused the government of managing the release of information about the attacks to their own political ends .
until the arrests on saturday , the government had insisted its prime line of investigation was directed at the basque separatists eta , although the scale of the attack and devastation it caused left some unconvinced .
if eta is to blame it would justify the pp 's hard line against the group and separatism in spain .
but if al-qaeda is to blame , however , it would bring into question spain 's decision to join the united states and britain in the war on iraq , something 90 % of spaniards opposed .
change expected the newspapers have different views of the government 's behaviour over the last few days .
abc says that " in little more than 48 hours the interior ministry has been able to present citizens the first concrete results of the police investigation into the 11-m attacks ...
the executive and jose maria aznar have behaved with efficiency and transparency . "
some are sceptical about the ruling party 's response but el mundo calls the latest arrests " an embarrassing situation for the government just a few hours from the elections " .
la razon noted that " it would have been better to know these facts -lrb- about the arrests -rrb- on thursday so that the election campaign would n't suffered such uncertainty .
but what is certain is that seldom has a police force showed the efficiency of the spanish police . "
electrician karim al-jadyan , 33 , believes the bombing will affect the outcome of the elections , but could not predict whether pp would be defeated or gain a majority .
" i think there will be changes , " he said .
" when something like this happens there is a change for something new .
there will be a new way of thinking , new laws for everything and no more flexibility . "
felipe clavello , 72 , and his wife carmen , 72 , said people were disappointed with the government but they preferred jose maria aznar 's successor mariano rajoy to the socialist -lrb- psoe -rrb- leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the main challenger .
as people go to cast their votes , party political posters put up before 11 march are now side-by-side with black ribbons of mourning .
how much change spain wants will be decided by monday morning .
