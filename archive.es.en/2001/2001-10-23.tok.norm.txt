" i guess i do n't sound terribly aussie on the air " , she says .
" but there 's a good reason for that .
when i arrived in england in the 1960 's from australia , the kids at school used to tease me all the time because of my aussie accent .
it used to drive me nuts so the accent had to go !
unfortunately , when i got went back to australia in 1975 , i sounded so posh that i got teased again for being a pom !
i just could n't win . "
after doing her bachelor of arts in history and then a postgraduate degree in library science in her homestate of queensland , she finally decided journalism was for her and went back for a degree in journalism .
" i knew i was on the right track when i won the journalism award in 1986 for the queensland division of the institution of engineers in australia .
you see , i did n't know a thing about engineering , but i knew i could write ! "

david pursglove , 57 , from uckfield , had a dramatic dream about two years ago which has changed his life .
in the dream a voice told him there was treasure under a pear tree in his garden and at the end of the hunt he found a unique source of water .
he is trying to bottle the water , which boots has expressed an interest in .
it 's medicine in a bottle .
it is unspoiled , untouched - a natural gift david pursglove having experienced psychic dreams since the age of four mr pursglove , an interior designer , knew to act upon the message .
he hired a metal detector thinking it may have been buried gold coins , but he found nothing .
then he chopped the tree down and dug until he was knee deep in water .
thinking he had failed to find his treasure he filled the puddle in .
mr pursglove told bbc news online : " three nights later in another dream a voice asked if i had found the treasure .
' valuable find ' " i said no , just water and the voice said ' the treasure is the water ' . "
next he hired drilling equipment and began a second treasure hunt .
he persevered and drilled to a depth of 120 feet when he reached a rock layer five feet thick .
mr pursglove said : " we broke through and finished up with a crashing roaring torrent . "
after he bottled a sample , a laboratory in kent tested the water .
' bottled medicine ' he said : " they found 16 minerals in it - there 's no other water like it .
it 's a valuable find .
" it 's good for the health with natural fluoride and its perfectly balanced . "
the water contains magnesium , calcium , phosphorous , iron , manganese , chloride , potassium and fluoride .
mr pursglove said : " it 's medicine in a bottle .
it is unspoiled , untouched - a natural gift . "
overall the dream has cost mr pursglove £ 6,500 , but he is trying to sell the idea which has gone from a " dream to reality " .

the move is part of scheme by the gloucestershire wildlife trust to try to increase the number of birds in the county .
while barn owl numbers have stopped declining , the trust says there are no signs of them increasing .
many have lost homes in derelict buildings or trees because of building work .
other traditional nest sites used by the owls , such as barns and other old farm buildings , are being replaced by modern buildings or houses which are not suited to barn owl habitation .
barn owl numbers in britain have also declined due to the use of pesticides , such as ddt , which are consumed by small mammals that are then eaten by the owls .
eventually , chemicals build up in the owls and weaken their eggshells .
but the trust is hoping to show people how to build nests to provide the birds with safe breeding sites .
chest donations however , the trust had had some problems with what to use to provide shelters to help the owls breed .
recently , it made an appeal for donations of tea chests , which make ideal nesting boxes because they are sturdy and largely damp-proof .
but efforts to get them from packaging firms failed .
the trust was told the chests are no longer made and so asked people to check their attics , sheds and basements for old tea chests , which can be turned into breeding boxes .
that appeal has met with some positive results and the modified boxes will be given to farmers and landowners to ensure there are plenty of nest sites for barn owls to use .
courses will be held in november explaining how the boxes tie in with the county 's biodiversity action plan .
barn owls are protected by the wildlife and countryside act of 1981 , under which it is an offence to intentionally disturb them while nesting .

david leech , from langport , has been commissioned to design the first string-version of the enid blyton character for 28 years .
the latest incarnation of noddy , with his traditional bright colours , his cheerful cheeky face and a bell in his hat , has already been making a name for itself around the world .
mr leech has heard from noddy collectors from as far afield as australia and california .
they want one of the first new puppets , which mr leech hopes to have completed in time for christmas .
noddy 's first story was published in 1949 now over 50 years old , noddy is still a firm favourite with children -four million noddy books are sold worldwide every year .
but it was the original watercolour drawings of dutch illustrator harmsen van der beek which helped give a face to the character .
when the pictures where sent to enid blyton for her approval she snapped them up .
mr van der beek died suddenly in 1953 , but not before he confessed to his publisher sometimes all he could see were little noddies crawling over his desk .
david leech believes he knows why enid blyton 's cheeky hero , who was first published in 1949 , has lost none of his appeal .
adult collectors he said : " everybody knows noddy .
that 's one of the main reasons i chose to do him .
he is still extremely popular .
" in fact , he is probably more popular now than he 's ever been . "
the new puppet was designed for the adult collectors ' market .
featuring a traditional " t-bar " control which makes him rock from side to side and nod , the final design was approved after 24 prototypes were produced over 18 months .
all the arm and leg pieces are cut in wood that have been drilled through .
after that it is just a question of threading it through with string and tying it together .
david said : " at first i did n't think it looked like noddy , but once i had put him together i could see he was the cheeky little boy who peers from the enid blyton books . "
enid blyton died in 1968 , but not before she was described as the " 20th century 's most successful children 's writer " .

so what hopes are there for a turnaround ?
bbc news online 's tim weber spoke to bruce claflin , chief executive of 3com , one of the besieged firms .
bruce claflin is a man who exudes supreme confidence .
he fits the image of a chief executive , with gold-rimmed glasses , immaculately trimmed grey hair , a winning smile and a warm , authoritative voice .
i had to save the company , save as many jobs as possible and save as much shareholder value as possible bruce claflin , 3com and he is a man who has fired 6,000 people during the past few months .
talking about it , the self-assured mr claflin suddenly seems to feel uncomfortable .
but the decision to sack half his company 's workforce , he says , was the right one .
" i had to save the company , save as many jobs as possible , and save as much shareholder value as possible , " he argues .
so he took the " rational decision " to cut all divisions that were dragging down 3com .
emotionally - " eye to eye " - it was not that easy .
mr claflin fired 40 % of the managers reporting directly to him , people he himself had hired .
the abc of hi-tech trouble how 3com has fallen .
the manufacturer of computer networking equipment is probably best known for its us robotics brand of modems , and the fact that it once owned palm , the maker of the ubiquitous palm top computers .
less than two years ago , 3com 's share price peaked at about $ 22 .
it now trades at just over $ 4 .
the firm once had more than 12,000 employees .
half of them have now gone .
and a few outsourcing deals and cutbacks later , 3com is left with only one production facility , in ireland , having closed down factories in california and singapore .
faced with what he describes as the widest and broadest tech industry downturn in living memory , bruce claflin has cut everything that does not promise growth or good profits .
but what 's left of 3com reads like the abc of hi-tech trouble .
3com profile founded : 1979 hq : santa clara , california staff : 6,000 annual sales : $ 2.82bn -lrb- year ending 1 june 2001 -rrb- its loss-making commworks subsidiary makes networking equipment for the telecoms industry .
the business networking division sells the hardware to build corporate computer networks , and the business connectivity division focuses on mobile access to computing .
all three segments have been hit by the economic downturn .
and 3com 's competitors are the biggest names in the industry - nortel , lucent , and the giant of them all , cisco .
to make things worse , more competitors are warming up on the sidelines , with the likes of dell among them .
the fall bruce claflin cites three reasons for the rapid rise and even faster downfall of the industry .
the telecoms deregulation in the us in 1996 and in europe in subsequent years kick-started demand for networking equipment .
two years later , companies began to invest heavily to beat the millennium bug .
then came the internet bubble , fuelled by low interest rates , easy money , " almost endless investor patience " and " excess industry hype " .
with demand escalating , all manufacturers ramped up production .
you ca n't out-cisco cisco bruce claflin but the boom came to an end when scores of firms ran out of money , faltered and failed .
in the telecoms sector , for example , 85 % of all firms set up during the boom went out of business .
suddenly , investors rediscovered the value of caution and refused further financing .
uncertain future bruce claflin prides himself to be one of the first to have seen the slump coming .
one year ago , 3com issued a profit warning and predicted a sharp industry-wide slowdown .
the same day , 3com 's nemesis cisco confirmed its optimistic earnings outlook .
but having been proved right is unlikely to earn mr claflin any points with investors , who look to the future .
and there uncertainty rules .
" there is hardly any visibility " about how the industry will develop , the 3com chief executive says .
before the terror attacks on 11 september he believed the economic cycle was " pretty close to bottom " .
the fundamental demand drivers -lsb- for the next upturn -rsb- are still here bruce claflin now all he can say is that " i do n't like the short-term , but i 'm optimistic for the medium and long-term " , with a possible recovery in the second half of 2002 .
at least he has experienced the hard times before .
unlike some of the " young people who entered the industry six or seven years ago " , he has " seen slumps and downturns " in the business .
the perfect storm mr claflin , a hobby sailor with a dock on the new hampshire coast , believes he can " sail in the storm " .
but he admits that this storm , this business slump , is worse than any he has seen before .
and so mr claflin keeps cutting back .
you can not " out-cisco cisco " and be present in every segment of the networking market , he says .
to achieve maximum returns , he has turned to the business practices espoused by former general electric chief jack welch , and aimed 3com at being a top player in each of its remaining markets .
niche player ?
the division making modems for adsl and broadband internet access , for example , targeted a rapidly growing market but had thin profit margins - and 3com was certainly not a market leader .
bruce claflin closed it down .
in some core server businesses , cisco had a 60 % market share , compared with 3com 's 4 % .
bruce claflin pulled out .
mr claflin winces , when i ask him if that leaves his company to be a mere niche player .
in his dictionary , niche is not a nice word .
3com now focuses its efforts exclusively on areas where it excels , and which have a potential for high growth , he says .
and he believes that there are opportunities for growth .
" the fundamental demand drivers -lsb- for the next upturn -rsb- are still here . "
cutting deep and early , and clearly defining 3com 's strengths may have given the firm just the competitive edge it needs to pull ahead of much larger rivals .
