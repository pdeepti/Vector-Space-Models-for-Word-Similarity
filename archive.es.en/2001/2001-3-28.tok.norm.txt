the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- ruled that the sainsbury 's advert was " ambiguous " and may have misled shoppers about whether or not pesticides were used .
the authority told the supermarket chain that the advertisement , which appeared last august , was not to be used in future .
a complainant first contacted the asa after seeing the advert that showed two red apples side by side , one beneath the heading pesticide , the other beneath the heading countryside .
a ladybird was crawling on the countryside apple with the advert reading : " all sainsbury 's british fruit and vegetables are grown with a commitment to using more natural farming methods , like this ladybird , to control pests . "
the complainant said the advertisement misleadingly implied that the advertisers had a policy of using no pesticides on its british fruit , whereas he believed they still used pesticides and artificial fertilisers .
' natural methods ' the advertisers claimed that they used only natural methods and no pesticides .
they argued that the words " with a commitment to " , were fundamental to the statement they were making .
sainsbury 's said it had been encouraging environmentally responsible farming , and that all their uk suppliers were committed to that goal .
they added that throughout the month-long duration of the campaign they were not aware of other complaints .
the asa upheld the complaint , saying the claim " with a commitment to using more natural farming methods " was ambiguous and readers could infer that all the methods the advertisers now used were natural .

the figure means that the population has grown by 132.2 million since 1990 , an increase of 11.7 % , said zhu zhixin , director-general of the national bureau of statistics .
annual growth was 1.07 % - down 0.4 % from the rate in the 1980s .
but some analysts believe the latest figures underestimate the population growth .
mr zhu said the census showed that china 's compulsory birth-control policies were effective in holding down population growth .
since the late 1970s china has restricted urban couples and many rural families to just one child to reduce the strain on food production and other resources .
but bbc beijing correspondent rupert wingfield-hayes says that serious questions remain over the accuracy of the figures .
hidden children counting china 's massive population is extremely difficult , made only more so by its one child policy , as tens of millions of people with extra children are thought to have hidden them from the census takers for fear of being punished .
the total figure was substantially lower than independent estimates , which put the number of chinese as high as 1.5 billion .
the census results also confirm fears that china 's gender imbalance is growing at an alarming rate .
there are now 117 boys born in china for every 100 girls - way above the international norm of 106 boys for every 100 girls .
female foetuses aborted china 's age-old preference for boys is being exacerbated , both by the one child policy and by modern technology , which can detect the sex of a child early in pregnancy .
such technology has led to a massive growth in the abortion of female foetuses .
the census found 6.8 million people in hong kong and 440,000 people in macau , according to mr zhu .
the report also said the figure included taiwan , which beijing does not control , but claims as part of its territory .
the self-governing island was found to have a population of 22.3 million - although chinese officials did not comment on how the taiwanese population figures were obtained .

napster is using the filter to prevent copyrighted music from appearing on its website , in accordance with a court order earlier this month .
but the record industry is not impressed and filed a new court order on tuesday seeking to force napster to change its filter system .
" napster seems to have adopted the most porous filter available , " said hilary rosen , president of the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- .
" it 's not working , it never will work and napster should be ordered to implement an effective filter or to change its filtering method . "
the riaa also maintains that many of the songs that napster claims to have filtered are still available on the site .
lack of co-operation napster , however , has defended itself by saying that the record industry has not co-operated sufficiently to allow it to comply with the court order .
the company said it had been flooded with song titles , but had not been given information about where the songs were on its system .
it also said that the record companies had failed to send in variants of any song names .
this is important because users of napster are saving their music files under new names that are similar but not quite like the real song title or artist 's name .
these conflicts have forced napster to spend " considerable resources " attempting to block access to songs .
' aggressively complying ' napster also maintains that 30 % of its staff are working on complying with the court order to ban copyrighted music .
hank barry , napster 's chief executive , stressed that " napster is aggressively complying with the injunction with significant , measurable results " .
according to the company , more than 275,000 songs can no longer be downloaded .
the riaa has asked the court to order napster to use a " filter in " method , which would allow songs that napster is authorised to distribute to be placed on its system , rather than blocking the swapping of copyrighted music placed on its service .

the move is being described by commentators in colombia as a snub , not just to president andres pastrana , but to the us government too . $ 100m is way short of the $ 1bn president pastrana was hoping to get from europe for his plan colombia , which is based on a total income of $ 7.5bn.
mr pastrana 's plans are in tatters spain has pledged $ 100m separately , but the small eu donation has left the president 's plan in tatters , as his government is broke and unable to find all of the $ 4.5bn that colombia was to contribute .
in fact , the only aid that is arriving as promised is the $ 1.3bn coming from the united states - mostly military aid , in the form of 60 helicopters and three us-trained anti-narcotics battalions .
they are ostensibly for the war against drugs , but have already seen action against marxist guerrillas who protect drugs fields and laboratories .
peace through negotiation but it was this military element that placed much of europe against president pastrana 's plan , believing that the fighting will simply escalate and that colombia really needs peace through negotiation and social investment .
but a peace process with the largest rebel group , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , the farc , has been going on for two years without any concrete progress .

the move is being described by commentators in colombia as a snub , not just to president andres pastrana , but to the us government too . $ 100m is way short of the $ 1bn president pastrana was hoping to get from europe for his plan colombia , which is based on a total income of $ 7.5bn.
spain has pledged $ 100m separately , but the small eu donation has left the president 's plan in tatters , as his government is broke and unable to find all of the $ 4.5bn that colombia was to contribute .
in fact , the only aid that is arriving as promised is the $ 1.3bn coming from the united states - mostly military aid , in the form of 60 helicopters and three us-trained anti-narcotics battalions .
they are ostensibly for the war against drugs , but have already seen action against marxist guerrillas who protect drugs fields and laboratories .
peace through negotiation but it was this military element that placed much of europe against president pastrana 's plan , believing that the fighting will simply escalate and that colombia really needs peace through negotiation and social investment .
