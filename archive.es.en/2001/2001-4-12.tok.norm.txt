the public spending watchdog , the accounts commission , says authorities are not collecting all of the council tax and rents they charge .
but the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- says councils are working hard to improve the situation .
scotland 's local authorities recently received an above inflation financial settlement , but councillors remain aware of the pressure on their services .
the accounts commission says improved management of services would give councils millions of pounds more to spend .
most of that extra money would come from uncollected council tax , which accounted for £ 52m last year - on top of the £ 900m which remains uncollected from the days of the poll tax .
but the commission also highlights refuse collection as an area where authorities could raise more money .
it says councils do not know how much to charge businesses for refuse collection , and reckons an extra £ 10m could be raised .
internal dispute however , cosla accused the commission of spin .
it said authorities had increased council tax collection last year and were working hard at bringing down arrears .
last month , glasgow , falkirk , dundee and clackmannanshire councils said they would not renew their membership of cosla at the end of the financial year .
the local authorities signalled their plan to withdraw over allegations that the organisation had failed to act in the bests interests of council tax payers .

mr hashimoto , who heads the liberal democratic party 's -lrb- ldp -rrb- largest faction , is the highest profile contender for the leadership , which will be decided in an election by party members in two weeks .
i hope i will be able to win the people 's understanding ryutaro hashimoto observers say he faces a strong challenge from the former health minister , junichiro koizumi , who has promised decisive change for the party which has dominated politics in japan for more than four decades .
analysts expect the contest to become a two-horse race between mr hashimoto and mr koizumi , with the spotlight on each man 's proposals for rescuing japan 's teetering economy .
the other two candidates are the economics minister , taro aso , and the party 's policy chief shizuka kamei .
last friday , current prime minister yoshiro mori confirmed his decision to leave office , after mounting criticism of his economic policies and a series of verbal gaffes and mishaps .
comeback the move marks quite a comeback for mr hashimoto , or hashiryu as he is popularly known , after he resigned in 1998 following japan 's plunge into recession .
his term in office was distinguished by his " big bang " reforms to open the financial sector , but his attempts to rein in the huge public debt by cutting spending proved disastrous .
he was forced to step down after the ldp was trounced in an upper house election in july 1998 .
with his slicked-back hair , rakish suits and ever-present cigarette , mr hashimoto is well known for his media-friendly attitude .
if elected , he would become only japan 's second post-war prime minister to leave and return to office .

excluding special items , yahoo said it had earned $ 7.6m compared with a profit of $ 60.5m in the same quarter last year , slightly beating analysts ' expectations .
drop in customers yahoo said its revenues fell to $ 180.2m from $ 230.8m a year earlier , also slightly ahead of analysts ' expectations .
but it revised its previous predictions for the second quarter , saying it expected to make less than expected .
yahoo relies heavily on advertising revenue from dot.com companies which has dried up in recent months .
the number of customers on its books fell by 15 % over the quarter to 3,145 , according to sources .
but customers , which tended to be increasingly from more established businesses , were signing longer contracts , the company said .
twice in the past few months yahoo has warned that there would be no profits for the first quarter .
hopeful investors ' nerves are likely to be rattled by ongoing uncertainty about the future direction of the company .
the company , which was once the darling of the high-tech sector , is still seeking a chief executive to replace mr koogle .
he announced his resignation earlier this year , but will remain chairman of the board .
however , with so much bad news already out in the open , investors will be hopeful that the value of their shares has little further to fall when markets open on thursday .
in recent weeks , yahoo has announced new initiatives that are designed to offset the decline in advertising revenues and move the company toward a more profitable business model that will include selling music .
last thursday , yahoo said it had joined an alliance between vivendi universal and sony , which is intended to rival napster 's online music sharing service .
the music of vivendi universal and sony music will be available - for a fee - through the yahoo website .
news of the deal sent yahoo 's share price 20 % higher .
pornography yahoo has also surprised some observers by reportedly entering the pornography market , one of the few internet sectors to consistently make money .
the los angeles times said the company has opened an online store stocked with adult videos and dvds .
uncertainty surrounding prospects for the us economy and the technology sector leaves many investors nervous about yahoo 's prospects .
some analysts say internet advertising revenue will drop about 20 % this year - a blow yahoo can ill-afford , having already slipped behind aol and microsoft 's msn in the internet portal pecking order .
they say the future for yahoo is to start charging users for services , as aol and msn already do .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- hostage : the dreaded h word news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : asia-pacific news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help languages editions change to uk thursday , 12 april , 2001 , 07:49 gmt 08:49 uk hostage : the dreaded h word the china crisis brought out the yellow ribbons again the 24 crew of an american spy plane held in china have been freed .
so were they " hostages " or merely " detainees " ?
politicians and diplomats are famous for their reluctance to call a spade a spade .
when the dung hits the rotating air circulation device , their choice of words can become even more careful .
the white house was reluctant to say " hostages " the dispute between china and the united states over an american spy plane and its crew proved another showcase for such linguistic acrobatics .
at centre stage was the wrangling over whether the president 's words of " regret " over the presumed death of a chinese fighter pilot should become an " apology " .
but at home , president bush faced a second terminological front : were the 24 crew of the downed ep-3 being held " hostage " by the chinese ?
locked in negotiations to bring the servicemen and women home , the bush administration was cautious not to use the word " hostage " .
' hotel environment ' this confused families of those navy personnel cooling their heels in a " hotel environment " on hainan island .
" i definitely think sean is a hostage there , " said james causon of his son 's enforced stay .
was it a one-way trip ?
in washington , the halls of power began to ring with the " h " word .
richard shelby -lrb- head of the senate intelligence committee -rrb- and henry hyde -lrb- chairman of the house international relations committee -rrb- both publicly uttered the loaded noun .
" i would call them hostages .
they are being held against their will , " reasoned mr hyde .
if it was clear to people across the united states , including those on capitol hill , that the crew had been taken " hostage " , why did president bush shy away from the word ?
right-wing republicans such as mr shelby and mr hyde were primarily interested in appealing to domestic opinion , said professor simon reich , director of research at the royal institute of international affairs .
i would call them hostages .
they are being held against their will republican congressman henry hyde the american public takes threats to the welfare of its military personnel very seriously .
as citizens of a superpower , americans are also keenly sensitive to the possibility of national humiliation .
professor reich said the tough talking was the " inevitable reaction of the right " .
the whole row may well make it easier for the us to increase military aid to the breakaway province of taiwan - a policy advocated by the republican right .
softly , softly " if the administration speaks softly to begin with , it can also take a stronger line later , " said professor reich .
the iranian hostage crisis still looms large other commentators suggested it was the word " hostage " which stuck in the presidential throat .
in the american psyche the word is tantamount to shouting " shark " at a beach .
although more than 20 years and four presidents ago , the 444 days of the iranian hostage crisis loom large in the nation 's collective memory .
when a student mob invaded tehran 's us embassy on 4 november 1979 , taking 90 staff hostage , not even those in the eye of the storm could foresee the epic drama that would unfold .
" i thought : ' if this thing lasts another 24 hours , we 're going to be way behind in our work , " ' said colonel chuck scott , the then military attaché .
colonel scott , along with 51 others , did not come home for more than a year .
the hostages were seen on tv screens across america - handcuffed , blindfolded and jostled by their captors .

so were they " hostages " or merely " detainees " ?
politicians and diplomats are famous for their reluctance to call a spade a spade .
when the dung hits the rotating air circulation device , their choice of words can become even more careful .
the dispute between china and the united states over an american spy plane and its crew proved another showcase for such linguistic acrobatics .
at centre stage was the wrangling over whether the president 's words of " regret " over the presumed death of a chinese fighter pilot should become an " apology " .
but at home , president bush faced a second terminological front : were the 24 crew of the downed ep-3 being held " hostage " by the chinese ?
locked in negotiations to bring the servicemen and women home , the bush administration was cautious not to use the word " hostage " .
' hotel environment ' this confused families of those navy personnel cooling their heels in a " hotel environment " on hainan island .
" i definitely think sean is a hostage there , " said james causon of his son 's enforced stay .
in washington , the halls of power began to ring with the " h " word .
richard shelby -lrb- head of the senate intelligence committee -rrb- and henry hyde -lrb- chairman of the house international relations committee -rrb- both publicly uttered the loaded noun .
" i would call them hostages .
they are being held against their will , " reasoned mr hyde .
if it was clear to people across the united states , including those on capitol hill , that the crew had been taken " hostage " , why did president bush shy away from the word ?
right-wing republicans such as mr shelby and mr hyde were primarily interested in appealing to domestic opinion , said professor simon reich , director of research at the royal institute of international affairs . "
i would call them hostages .
they are being held against their will " republican congressman henry hyde the american public takes threats to the welfare of its military personnel very seriously .
as citizens of a superpower , americans are also keenly sensitive to the possibility of national humiliation .
professor reich said the tough talking was the " inevitable reaction of the right " .
the whole row may well make it easier for the us to increase military aid to the breakaway province of taiwan - a policy advocated by the republican right .
softly , softly " if the administration speaks softly to begin with , it can also take a stronger line later , " said professor reich .
other commentators suggested it was the word " hostage " which stuck in the presidential throat .
in the american psyche the word is tantamount to shouting " shark " at a beach .
although more than 20 years and four presidents ago , the 444 days of the iranian hostage crisis loom large in the nation 's collective memory .
when a student mob invaded tehran 's us embassy on 4 november 1979 , taking 90 staff hostage , not even those in the eye of the storm could foresee the epic drama that would unfold .
" i thought : ' if this thing lasts another 24 hours , we 're going to be way behind in our work , " ' said colonel chuck scott , the then military attaché .
colonel scott , along with 51 others , did not come home for more than a year .
the hostages were seen on tv screens across america - handcuffed , blindfolded and jostled by their captors .
obsession although the details of their rough treatment -lrb- including a series of mock executions -rrb- did not come to light until their release , the hostages ' plight became a " national obsession " , according to time magazine in 1981 .
yellow ribbons were hung as symbols of solidarity with the hostages , the first outside the us home of the embassy 's charges d 'affaires .
the inability of jimmy carter 's administration to master the intricacies of post-revolution iranian politics and a fatally abortive rescue mission are often cited for the president 's failure to win re-election in 1980 .

the protest follows the recent detention of more than 40 people associated with the banned liberal opposition group , freedom movement .
the judiciary has said that those arrested were plotting to overthrow the islamic regime .
human rights organisations abroad have also strongly condemned the arrests .
one group , human rights watch , termed the arrests a creeping coup against the reformists .
secret location the letter , which was signed by well over half of the reformist-dominated parliament , was read out on the floor of the chamber .
it complained that many of the detainees were being held at a secret location and denied visits by their families or by lawyers .
but the mps demanded to know why the intelligence ministry , which is supposed to be in charge of such issues , had been by-passed .
the intelligence minister appeared in parliament earlier this week .
he said he had no information to suggest the detainees were involved in any such plots .
the judiciary , which is independent both of parliament and of president mohammad khatami 's reformist government , had dismissed earlier criticism .
condemnation it said those who voiced it did not have access to incriminating evidence and confessions .
but the reformists are convinced that the intensifying wave of arrests and recent closures of newspapers are all part of a right-wing campaign to foil the reformist movement ahead of presidential elections in june .
the arrests have prompted similar accusations and condemnation from international human rights groups .
human rights watch , said the judicial campaign was beginning to look like a coup aimed at denying the reformists their electoral success .
they have won both the presidency and parliament with huge public endorsement .
but popularity has not led to power , as hard-line conservatives maintain their grip on many key institutions .
president khatami has not yet announced whether he intends to stand again in june .
his supporters believe the escalated campaign of arrests is aimed at dissuading and weakening him .

economic analysts business strategies predict that the province will notch up growth of 3.4 % this year - ahead of the national average predicted at 2.6 % .
the province will share the top spot for growth this year , along with the south east , leaving london - traditionally the leader in the uk - lagging just behind with a growth forecast of 3.3 % .
next year , northern ireland is predicted to continue powering ahead at 3.4 % , making it the number one economic growth spot in the uk .
andy schofield , managing economist at business strategies , said the " peace dividend " and a booming electronics industry were bringing prosperity to the region .
he said the electronics industry in northern ireland grew by more than 50 % last year .
mr schofield said : " when industry starts building up again you have increased migration and people coming back and you start building up a private local boom .
" when businesses start building up you start getting a lot of financial and business services .
" it is like in wales , when it started to re-position itself after the mining closures . "
business strategies economist anthony light said : " from these figures it can be seen that expansion will remain appreciably faster than in the uk as a whole over the next few years . "
the assessment followed an announcement on wednesday that 200 jobs are to be lost with the closure of the coats viyella textiles plant in lisnaskea , county fermanagh .
northern ireland enterprise minister sir reg empey said while the factory closure was a setback , the figures proved the economy was nevertheless benefiting from the province 's politicians taking charge of the region 's affairs .
he said : " devolution has given northern ireland a great start along the road to prosperity .
" there 's renewed confidence and self-belief and , in turn , the global marketplace is looking approvingly at what is happening .
" our economy is making good progress .
although i continue to have concerns about particular sectors , the reality is that there are now 7,000 more people in jobs than a year ago . "

the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- has cut its growth forecast from 2.5 % to 2 % for 2001 , and predicted that the jobless total will rise by an extra 50,000 .
the institute of directors -lrb- iod -rrb- also raised concerns over the slowing economy when it released a survey showing a continuing slide in business optimism .
the bleak prognosis came after announcements of thousands of possible job losses at ship builder cammell laird and marconi and as doubts remain over the future of 3,200 jobs at motorola 's mobile phone factory in bathgate , west lothian .
confidence falling " this is going to be a worrying easter for many people in business .
it is clear the foot and mouth epidemic and the slowdown in america will be strongly felt in many quarters , " said digby jones , director general of the cbi .
he went on to say it was too soon to talk of recession .
while the us slowdown was likely to have the greater effect in the long-term , the cbi said the most pressing problem was foot-and-mouth , which accounted for 0.3 % of the reduction in the growth rate forecast .
in its report , the iod said economic activity peaked in the first quarter of 2000 , and has been decelerating over the last four quarters .
their index of business optimism - the balance of business leaders who were more optimistic , rather than less - fell to 28 % in the first quarter of this year from 35 % in the final quarter of last year .
" in addition to the deteriorating international environment , falling equity prices and the cumulative knock-on effects of the foot and mouth epidemic are increasingly damaging economic confidence and activity , " said ruth lea , head of the policy unit at the iod .
she warned there was a very real chance of a serious economic downturn .
manufacturers more positive but latest figures from the british chambers of commerce -lrb- bcc -rrb- show that despite the global slowdown , confidence in manufacturing has risen to its highest level for a year .
in a survey of more than 7,000 uk firms , it showed that although manufacturers have been reporting slower growth in domestic sales this year , more were optimistic about improving turnover over the next 12 months .
" underlying strength in the domestic economy remains , " said david sears , deputy director general at the bcc .
" manufacturers -lsb- are -rsb- confident of avoiding the worst of the impact of the global slowdown , " he added .
british economy britain last week cut interest rates a quarter of a point to 5.5 % to help cushion the economy from the us slowdown , but they are still the highest rates among the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- top industrialised nations .
hopes that the european central bank would add its weight to kick-starting the flagging global economy received a setback on wednesday when it left interest rates on hold in the euro-zone .

" underlying strength in the domestic economy remains , " said david sears , deputy director general at the bcc .
" manufacturers -lsb- are -rsb- confident of avoiding the worst of the impact of the global slowdown , " he added .
british economy britain last week cut interest rates a quarter of a point to 5.5 % to help cushion the economy from the us slowdown , but they are still the highest rates among the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- top industrialised nations .
hopes that the european central bank would add its weight to kick-starting the flagging global economy received a setback on wednesday when it left interest rates on hold in the euro-zone .

the order to the police and military to restore law and order in the province was given in a decree signed by the country 's president , abdurrahman wahid .
with 30,000 troops already in the province , there are genuine fears the bloodshed will now increase the decree deliberately avoids using the words military operation .
but it is well known that for months , army generals have been putting pressure on the government to sanction a crackdown on the separatist movement .
the announcement was made despite an appeal to the president earlier this week by a delegation of acehenese leaders to scrap the plans for a military crackdown .
pressure the government is officially describing the latest move as an effort to bring about a comprehensive solution to the acehenese problem .
the rebels recently have been gaining strength , especially as it became increasingly clear that direct peace talks were making little progress .
in march , the government officially outlawed the rebel free aceh movement to give legal cover for the planned military operation .
there is an urgent need to quell the violence in aceh , which has already claimed hundreds of lives this year .
bloodshed it also led to the closure last month of huge gas-fields in the province operated by the american company exxon-mobil , causing losses of $ 100m per month to the government .
but among the acehenese people and human rights campaigners , there is much opposition to the prospect of another military operation against the rebels .
a similar crackdown in the 1990s led to thousands of people being killed .
the army was accused of massive human rights violations .
with 30,000 troops already in the province , there are genuine fears the bloodshed will now increase rather than peace being restored .
