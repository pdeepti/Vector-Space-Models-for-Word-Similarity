troops loyal to president ange-felix patasse used mortars and rocket launchers backed by tanks to capture the kassai camp on friday , the main military barracks in the southern suburbs .
he -lsb- kolingba -rsb- should surrender and face justice president 's spokesman prosper ndouba they are being assisted by libyan forces who were flown in to help the government put down renegade soldiers who attempted a takeover on monday .
meanwhile mr patasse , has condemned action by his armed forces against civilians during a search for the perpetrators of the failed coup .
" there were some inappropriate actions and mistakes during the operations in certain parts of bangui .
we condemn in the firmest manner what went on , " presidential spokesman prosper ndouba said .
strewn bodies the fighting for control of the barracks was heavy despite efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the four-day stand-off .
several people were killed and many injured in the clashes , which later spread to an adjoining area in the east of the city .
witnesses said the streets of bangui were strewn with bodies .
the mutineers had been using the barracks as a base after monday 's attempted coup failed .
the president had claimed earlier in the week that troops loyal to him had control of the city , but as fighting continued this did not appear to be the case .
kolingba charged the assault on the barracks began on monday night and despite efforts by french diplomats to negotiate a peaceful end to the siege , it appears the government was in no mood for compromise .
general andre kolingba has been charged with insurrection and murder a presidential spokesman said the leader of the rebellion , former military ruler general andre kolingba , had been charged with insurrection and murder .
" he -lsb- kolingba -rsb- has attempted a coup and he has failed .
he should assume his responsibilities .
he should surrender and face justice , " the spokesman , prosper ndouba , was quoted as saying by reuters .
the spokesman said the general was responsible for an attempt to kill president patasse during monday 's attacks on his official residence , in which several presidential guards were shot dead .
whereabouts unknown the whereabouts of general kolingba , who has been behind a number of army mutinies in the past , is not known but he is assumed to be still at large .
mr kolingba has acknowledged his involvement in the rebellion but denied it was a coup attempt .
he said that it was an effort to bring " peace and security to the country " and appealed for france - the former colonial power - to help restore security .
general kolingba was head of state for 12 years until he lost elections to mr patasse in 1993 .
instability the car has a history of military uprisings , with three major rebellions against mr patasse since 1996 .
low or delayed pay has been a main complaint of soldiers in the rebellions .
at least 20 people died in the initial phase of the fighting , and the death toll is now feared to be much higher .
for years , bangui has effectively been divided in two - with the north end loyal to the president and the south a stronghold of the opposition .

crown prince dipendra , educated at exclusive eton college in the united kingdom , is reported to have been at odds with his family for some time over his choice of bride .

however , the king has remained extremely popular in nepal .
last december hundreds of people lined the streets of kathmandu to greet the king on his 55th birthday .
some people in nepal , which is 90 % hindu , believe that the king is the reincarnation of the god vishnu .
