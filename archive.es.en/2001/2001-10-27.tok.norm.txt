it was not clear how the anthrax , which was not in sufficient concentrations to be a significant health risk , came to be in the offices .
also on friday , the us supreme court closed down after anthrax was found on a filter at its mail-sorting office .
health officials recommended antibiotics for thousands more people to prevent possible new infections .
domestic or foreign ?
on friday , the white house said that anthrax found in a letter sent to senate majority leader tom daschle may have been produced within the united states .
spokesman ari fleischer said scientific advisers had concluded that " a phd microbiologist in a sophisticated laboratory " could have been behind the outbreak .
anthrax cases 3 deaths -lrb- 2 in washington dc , 1 in florida -rrb- 7 cases inhalation anthrax 7 cases skin anthrax 32 further people exposed to the disease 10,000 taking antibiotics on us government advice but he added : " it does not rule out that it could be state supported , or that it comes from a foreign location . "
on friday , abc television quoted three anonymous sources as saying that intial tests on the letter sent to mr daschle showed a chemical that is typical of iraq 's biological weapons ' programme .
bentonite makes anthrax more deadly by keeping the particles separate and thus more easily airborne and more easily inhaled .
however , mr fleischer denied that tests on mr daschle 's letter had revealed traces of bentonite .
more tests the three congressmen who offices showed traces of anthrax were john e baldacci , rush holt and mike pence who all have offices on the sixth and seventh floors of longworth house at the capitol .
anthrax was discovered in two more locations on friday : a central intelligence agency mail handling building at its headquarters in suburban virginia , and on a filter removed from a warehouse that screens mail for the us supreme court in washington .
federal officials said there was no evidence that spores were in the court building itself .
they are the latest in a series of cases linked to the mail , which have prompted the us postal service to carry out checks on government-related mailrooms , hand out antibiotics to thousands of workers and purchase irradiation equipment to treat letters .
two postal service workers , who were employed at the washington sorting office that handled the letter sent to senator daschle died , earlier this week after contracting inhalation anthrax .
two of their colleagues are receiving treatment for the same form of the disease .
at present the only known source of anthrax in washington is the letter sent to senator daschle .
investigators say either there are more undiscovered letters or anthrax spores are being spread through the postal system after being picked up by sorting machines .
in new york , anthrax has been detected on four mail-sorting machines at a processing station that handles millions of parcels a day .
florida outbreak in an earlier outbreak at a tabloid newspaper in florida , two men contracted inhalation anthrax , one of whom died .
there have also been cases of cutaneous , or skin anthrax , a less serious form of the disease , in several new york media offices and mail offices in new jersey .
seven people are known to have been infected with it .
so far , investigators have failed to trace the source of the anthrax or pinpoint a possible culprit , but identifying the method used to treat the spores may narrow the field .
officials have no evidence of a link to those who planned the 11 september terror attacks on new york and washington , but president george w bush says he " would n't put it past " saudi-born militant osama bin laden , believed to have masterminded the attacks .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- war on terror ' may last 50 years ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 27 october , 2001 , 08:20 gmt 09:20 uk war on terror ' may last 50 years ' sir michael -lrb- left -rrb- and adam ingram brief the media the campaign against terrorism might last half a century , according to the chief of the defence staff .
admiral sir michael boyce compared it to a new cold war and said the conflict in afghanistan was the most difficult britain had faced since the korean war in the 1950s .
he said the war against communism had taken 50 years of constant pressure during which time the west " did not blink " .
echoing sir michael 's views , defence secretary geoff hoon , who is with british troops in oman , said no-one was in any doubt about the difficulty of the operation in afghanistan .
this is the most difficult operation we have undertaken admiral sir michael boyce speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme on saturday , he said : " this will take as long as it takes .
" we recognise the military difficulties of this operation , but that does not undermine in any way our determination to carry it through . "
but mr hoon would not be drawn on his expectation of how long the war would continue .
he said : " i do n't think it 's possible to put a timetable on this .
" it could be that the taleban 's fanaticism takes them through to the new year .
" but it could equally be that as a result of the sustained pressure that 's being brought to bear on them that they collapse overnight . "
sir michael said the initial campaign in afghanistan could last three to four years .
we recognise the military difficulties of this operation , but that does not undermine in any way our determination to carry it through .
geoff hoon he said there had been identifiable enemies during the 1982 falklands war and the 1991 gulf war - but said : " the al-qaeda organisation is not tangible - you are fighting against this thing called terrorism " .
" we are fighting a concept not a state and are having to re-write the rule book , " he continued .
sir michael admitted it would be " extraordinarily difficult " to achieve the military objectives unless the taleban regime " folded " .
" this is the most difficult operation we have undertaken , " he added .
war uncertainties 40 commando does regular arctic training the assessment comes at the end of a week of setbacks for the alliance against terror .
on friday us navy fighters and b-52 bombers mistakenly bombed six warehouses used by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- , destroying vital stocks of food .
the blunder came a day after the united nations confirmed that nine people had been killed when a us cluster bomb landed near a village in western afghanistan on monday .
standby commandos on friday , uk armed forces minister adam ingram committed 200 troops from 40 commando to ground offensives in afghanistan .
they are already in the region following a training exercise in oman .
the troops on standby will form part of a " large and flexible " force , totalling 4,200 personnel , and supported by a substantial amount of hardware .
aircraft carrier hms illustrious , a submarine armed with cruise missiles , the destroyer hms southampton and the frigate hms cornwall will remain in the region .
hms illustrious is part of the " powerful force " the minister said seven royal fleet auxiliary ships and four support aircraft - nimrod maritime patrol and hercules transport planes - will stay behind too .
another 400 troops from 40 commando would be on standby in britain when they return to their base in taunton , somerset from oman next week .

admiral sir michael boyce compared it to a new cold war and said the conflict in afghanistan was the most difficult britain had faced since the korean war in the 1950s .
he said the war against communism had taken 50 years of constant pressure during which time the west " did not blink " .
echoing sir michael 's views , defence secretary geoff hoon , who is with british troops in oman , said no-one was in any doubt about the difficulty of the operation in afghanistan .
this is the most difficult operation we have undertaken admiral sir michael boyce speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme on saturday , he said : " this will take as long as it takes .
" we recognise the military difficulties of this operation , but that does not undermine in any way our determination to carry it through . "
but mr hoon would not be drawn on his expectation of how long the war would continue .
he said : " i do n't think it 's possible to put a timetable on this .
" it could be that the taleban 's fanaticism takes them through to the new year .
" but it could equally be that as a result of the sustained pressure that 's being brought to bear on them that they collapse overnight . "
sir michael said the initial campaign in afghanistan could last three to four years .
we recognise the military difficulties of this operation , but that does not undermine in any way our determination to carry it through .
geoff hoon he said there had been identifiable enemies during the 1982 falklands war and the 1991 gulf war - but said : " the al-qaeda organisation is not tangible - you are fighting against this thing called terrorism " .
" we are fighting a concept not a state and are having to re-write the rule book , " he continued .
sir michael admitted it would be " extraordinarily difficult " to achieve the military objectives unless the taleban regime " folded " .
" this is the most difficult operation we have undertaken , " he added .
war uncertainties the assessment comes at the end of a week of setbacks for the alliance against terror .
on friday us navy fighters and b-52 bombers mistakenly bombed six warehouses used by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- , destroying vital stocks of food .
the blunder came a day after the united nations confirmed that nine people had been killed when a us cluster bomb landed near a village in western afghanistan on monday .
standby commandos on friday , uk armed forces minister adam ingram committed 200 troops from 40 commando to ground offensives in afghanistan .
they are already in the region following a training exercise in oman .
the troops on standby will form part of a " large and flexible " force , totalling 4,200 personnel , and supported by a substantial amount of hardware .
aircraft carrier hms illustrious , a submarine armed with cruise missiles , the destroyer hms southampton and the frigate hms cornwall will remain in the region .
the minister said seven royal fleet auxiliary ships and four support aircraft - nimrod maritime patrol and hercules transport planes - will stay behind too .
another 400 troops from 40 commando would be on standby in britain when they return to their base in taunton , somerset from oman next week .
sir michael said the marines could be used to mount " precise surgical raids " against targets such as taleban control-and-command centres or ammunition dumps .
40 commando is part of the royal marines ' 3,500-strong 3 commando brigade , all of whom are trained for winter warfare and arctic fighting .

the enigmatic hu jintao , currently vice president , is hardly known outside his homeland and his trip to russia , the united kingdom , france , spain and germany is being seen as a chance for him to step out onto the world stage .
the late leader deng xiaoping anointed hu jintao the 11 september attacks on the united states have thrust the tour into the international spotlight .
mr hu is the first chinese leader to visit the west since those attacks took place and america 's response to them looks set to dominate his discussions .
" the objective of the visits is to strengthen our friendship and cooperation with the various countries , " a chinese foreign ministry spokesman told the french news agency afp .
" during the meetings with the leaders of the countries he will exchange views on issues of common concern , including the fight against terrorism . "
concern in russia mr hu is be the third chinese leader to visit russia in four months .
last july , president jiang signed a friendship pact with president vladimir putin , based largely on the two governments ' mutual opposition to the us missile defence plans .
jiang zemin will step down as president in 2003 but mr putin 's new close relationship with us president george bush has caused concern in beijing that moscow might change its mind on missile defence .
the two countries still share the hope , however , that the war on terrorism will help justify their own campaigns against islamic separatists .
after moscow mr hu will move on to a somewhat less certain welcome in britain , where pro-tibet independence groups are promising him a rough ride .
the free tibet campaign says it plans to hold vigils during the vice president 's visit .
" it would reflect well on tony blair at this time to demonstrate a commitment to pursuing peaceful solutions to global problems , such as the occupation of tibet , " said a statement issued by the group .
anointed successor mr hu , 59 , ranks fifth in the communist party 's seven-member politburo standing committee and is its youngest member .
he was anointed successor to president jiang zemin by the late paramount leader , deng xiaoping , and will replace him as leader of the party next year .
he will then take mr jiang 's place as president when the latter steps down in 2003 .
outside the communist party inner circle , very little is known about the chinese vice president .
some say he has a photographic memory , others that he likes ballroom dancing and table tennis .
but what he says and does abroad will be scrutinised minutely , not only by the governments in the west but also by his own colleagues back in beijing .

the counter-terrorism committee was set up as part of a un resolution passed by the security council in the aftermath of the attacks on washington and new york last month .
the committee is like a global headmaster that will cast a critical eye over report cards submitted by all 189 un member states .
the reports , which are due to be submitted by the 27 december , are meant to contain details of what steps the member states have taken to block the activities of terrorist groups within their borders .
guidance and punishment the reports should take the form of answers to a terrorism questionnaire .
the kind of questions that are asked include : what steps have been taken to establish terrorist acts as serious criminal offences ?
and what measures , if any , have been taken to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts ?
the committee is chaired by the uk ambassador to the un , sir jeremy greenstock .
he has the job of analysing the reports and deciding whether individual states are taking the necessary counter-terrorism measures as demanded by last month 's security council resolution .
those that fall short of these standards could face punishment if the security council decides they are acting in bad faith .
but the counter-terrorism committee also has the option of offering additional guidance and technical assistance to states that lack the capability to fight terrorism on their own .

more than 50 people received minor injuries .
a curfew has been declared in the area , and the deputy chief minister of maharashtra , chhaggan bhujbal , says the situation is now tense but under control .
reports say the trouble started when a group of muslims returned from friday prayer in the town of malegaon , some 250 km -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- from bombay .
large numbers of local police tried to prevent a small group of muslims from distributing leaflets calling on people to boycott us-made goods and to oppose the american air strikes on afghanistan .
demo turns violent when the protesters started shouting slogans , additional police were called in and the demonstrators started throwing stones at the security forces .
the police say they then baton-charged the crowd , which led to more people coming on to the streets .
the police felt outnumbered and started shooting .
three people were killed at first and more died later in hospital .
there have been several anti-us demonstrations by indian muslims since the bombing began in afghanistan , but this is the first time anyone has died .
it appears as though this was mainly a law-and-order situation that got out of control because of police nervousness .

eggs have been thrown at tourists and there is a growing dislike among parts of the community for the " circus " caused by the tours .
now it is feared a new film about jack the ripper , starring hollywood heart-throb johnny depp , will only add to the aggravation .
from hell , which opened in america at number one in the us box office , is expected to renew interest in britain 's most famous serial killer .
large numbers tours of the whitechapel and spitalfields area of the east end have been taken for more than 40 years but the trouble has erupted only recently .
residents are angry at what some call the " zoo or circus " passing by their homes and the growing numbers who take part .
when people suddenly see about 200 people coming into their street they can feel intimidated councillor ala uddin , tower hamlets council eggs have been thrown during tours and two weeks ago a 53-year-old woman was reported to have been shot at with an air rifle and her tour group stoned by youths .
official tour guides have defended their tradition and say they are sensitive to the feelings of locals .
councillor ala uddin , who represents residents in the spitalfields ward , which includes part of whitechapel , said : " i know there are reservations from the community , they say the place is like a zoo or circus with large numbers of people visiting . "
" when people suddenly see about 200 people coming into their street they can feel intimidated . "
tours can continue for 12 hours , starting at 0800 in the morning and finishing around 2100 at night .
what also angers residents is the volume of tourists arriving is not matched by their spending in the area , he said .
tower hamlets council 's policy is to welcome visitors interested in the heritage and history of the area , he said .
" but some residents do not see it as being to their benefit , " he said .
tour guide john muffty , who owns an official london tourist board blue badge for taking tours , was leading a tour when an egg was thrown .
" i suspect it was more like kids than anything else but i do know that there have been complaints in the neighbourhood , mainly about the larger groups that go round .
' sensitive ' " there is concern that the film is coming out , which will arose more interest , and some residents are not happy about that . "
mr muffty said numbers on his tours are small and the egg-throwing incident was the first he had experienced .
we are extremely sensitive to the locals and we do not stop in front of anyone 's house .
we do walk past but if these people live in the city people are going to walk past david tucker , london walks david tucker , from london walks , said his group does have larger numbers , but he stressed it would not be as many as 100 .
" we are extremely sensitive to the locals and we do not stop in front of anyone 's house .
we do walk past but if these people live in the city people are going to walk past . "
" you have to ask is it better to take one larger group or eight parties of 12 people through ? " he added .
mr tucker , who used to take jack the ripper tours said londoners themselves go on the tours and businesses in the area are pleased with the increase in trade .
he maintained that they have never had any incidents of residents complaining directly to his tour group but said the trouble may well come from " cowboy " operators who are cashing in on the interest .
from hell , which refers to a taunting letter written by the ripper , giving his return address as from hell , is due out in the uk in february .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- war view : ' we ca n't predict the outcome but action is vital ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 27 october , 2001 , 14:10 gmt 15:10 uk war view : ' we ca n't predict the outcome but action is vital ' the inherent unpredictability of war should not be mistaken for an excuse for pacifism , says dr christopher bassford , of the us national war college , in a personal view .
one of the oddest phrases in the english language is ' the foreseeable future ' .
the time period it describes varies with the phenomenon under discussion .
in economics , for instance , it lasts until the next report from the stock market , the fed , or the bureau of labor statistics .
in domestic life , it lasts until the next poorly phrased remark to one 's spouse .
but as a matter of fundamental truth , the ' foreseeable future ' is over before the echo of the words has faded from the room .
the penalties for falsely imagining a predictable universe are particularly unpleasant in war this is no truer in war than in many other aspects of life .
in war , however , the penalties for falsely imagining a predictable universe are particularly unpleasant .
people die in large numbers .
governments are overturned , economies destroyed , empires turned to ashes , civilisations turned to dust .
we know this not from prediction but from experience , a somewhat more reliable guide .
unfortunately , even historical experience is misleading , because we know - or think we know - how things turned out .
we therefore tend to think that this outcome was inevitable , and so assume that some outcome of current events is similarly inevitable .
we therefore could hope to get the future right , if only we were good enough at gathering the right data .
only very smart professional historians - which is to say a very small minority even of that profession - come to appreciate how contingent on chance and coincidence the actual outcomes were .
indeed , once one knows how fragmentary our understanding of past events really is , it 's nearly as hard to ' postdict ' the past as it is to predict the future .
why , precisely , did milosevic give up in the recent war over kosovo ?
why did the union win the american civil war ?
why did the roman empire fall - if , in fact , it fell at all ?
there are as many answers as there are people interested in the issue - plus the correct one , of course , which has probably eluded us all .
much up to chance why are military events , in particular , so unpredictable ?
it is because the events of war are driven by the strange interaction of three completely different kinds of forces .
unpredictability is also down to sheer chance : does it rain the night before your great offensive ?
the first is the rational calculations of the opposing leaders .
given that they actively seek to frustrate and fool one another , it should not surprise us that they routinely succeed in derailing each other 's visions of the future .
the second force is the gut emotions of leaders and the populations they try to control .
hatred makes people do things not remotely in their own predictable ' best interests ' , as understood by any rational standard .
and a third source of unpredictability is sheer chance : does it rain the night before your great offensive is to begin - and did you know that your new artillery fuzes do n't function well when they land in mud ?
victory by accident , not design these sources of uncertainty interact with one another , sometimes vastly increasing the effect .
consider the possible impact of a chance occurrence , say , that a stray bomb -lrb- or an earthquake -rrb- had killed osama bin laden on the first night of air raids on afghanistan .
consider the impact of a chance occurrence , say , that a stray bomb -lrb- or an earthquake -rrb- had killed bin laden american leaders probably would have recognised it as an unbelievable stroke of luck - though they would be fools to say so and us air force budgeteers would have immediately sought the credit and bigger budgets .
everyone else would have assumed it was intentional .
this would have vastly increased the paranoia of those who had already suspected the feds knew where everybody was at every moment .
allies might have been so impressed that they dropped out of the anti-terrorism effort - after all , the americans did n't need any help from them .
it might have paralyzed the terrorist leadership , who certainly understand the value of terror .
but it would also have made american citizens cocky and dismissive of their leaders ' pleas for more patience , internal security , and funding of necessary conventional forces .
who knows what its emotional effect on the muslim masses might have been ?
would they be overawed by american power , or infuriated and driven to even deeper , more opaque conspiracies ?
would the long-term result be to strengthen or to weaken the us position ?
do you know ?
i do n't .
strategy a ' poor bet ' because of these interactions between the opponents and among the forces of reason , emotion and chance , military strategy is by its very nature a poor bet .
even in an ideal case , strategy has a dubious success rate of 50 % assume the simplest possible military problem , army a versus army b in a one-on-one contest in which one side wins in a single clash of arms .
even then , strategy has a dubious success rate of 50 % .
in the real world , wars seldom involve only two players , very seldom are won by either side using its initial strategy , and frequently lack any clear winner at all .
in most cases , the surviving strategists are n't even the ones who started the war in the first place - the originators having fallen to bullets , internal intrigues , or revolutions .
consider this : my father was born in 1917 , when europe was ruled by kaisers , czars , and sultans .
those emperors are gone , victims of wars they set in motion themselves .
they were replaced by revolutionaries , then by führers , duces , party general secretaries , and most recently by elected yuppies .
the mighty third reich , passionately defended by millions of true believers and the most formidable armies the modern world has ever seen , lasted 12 years .
the soviet union lasted less than a single human lifetime .
had someone told you -lrb- or the cia -rrb- in 1979 that a soviet invasion of afghanistan would : a -rrb- be defeated , b -rrb- lead to the collapse of the soviet union within a dozen years , and c -rrb- set the stage for demolition of the world trade center in 2001 , you -lrb- and the cia -rrb- probably would have suggested medication .
but in the end , my father outlived the ussr by more than a decade .
' action is imperative ' so no one knows - or can know - how the current crisis will turn out .
objectively , then , it is safe to say that warfare is an extraordinarily risky ' instrument of policy ' .
the effective strategist makes plans , but does not delude himself that they will unfold as intended the inherent unpredictability of war should not be mistaken , however , as an excuse for pacifism or as a reason not to act .
neither is it a reason for timid or insubstantial action .
confronted by barbarism , a civilised society must fight or die .
indeed , the unpredictability of war makes action imperative .
oftentimes , the bold , sweeping action is the safest course .
sometimes , such bold action is necessary even when it opens nasty cans of worms we 'd prefer to avoid , if those cans are likely destined to be opened anyway and under less favourable conditions .
what war 's fundamental unpredictability does mean is that strategy is a full-time , ongoing job that never ends .
the effective strategist makes plans , but does not delude himself that they will unfold as intended .
he constantly envisions what 's desirable , pursues - and protects against - what 's possible , acts on what 's probable , and constantly adjusts for what actually happens .
and he never gives up .
eventually , someone will get it right .
we 'd damned well better make certain that it 's us .

one of the oddest phrases in the english language is ' the foreseeable future ' .
the time period it describes varies with the phenomenon under discussion .
in economics , for instance , it lasts until the next report from the stock market , the fed , or the bureau of labor statistics .
in domestic life , it lasts until the next poorly phrased remark to one 's spouse .
but as a matter of fundamental truth , the ' foreseeable future ' is over before the echo of the words has faded from the room .
the penalties for falsely imagining a predictable universe are particularly unpleasant in war this is no truer in war than in many other aspects of life .
in war , however , the penalties for falsely imagining a predictable universe are particularly unpleasant .
people die in large numbers .
governments are overturned , economies destroyed , empires turned to ashes , civilisations turned to dust .
we know this not from prediction but from experience , a somewhat more reliable guide .
unfortunately , even historical experience is misleading , because we know - or think we know - how things turned out .
we therefore tend to think that this outcome was inevitable , and so assume that some outcome of current events is similarly inevitable .
we therefore could hope to get the future right , if only we were good enough at gathering the right data .
only very smart professional historians - which is to say a very small minority even of that profession - come to appreciate how contingent on chance and coincidence the actual outcomes were .
indeed , once one knows how fragmentary our understanding of past events really is , it 's nearly as hard to ' postdict ' the past as it is to predict the future .
why , precisely , did milosevic give up in the recent war over kosovo ?
why did the union win the american civil war ?
why did the roman empire fall - if , in fact , it fell at all ?
there are as many answers as there are people interested in the issue - plus the correct one , of course , which has probably eluded us all .
much up to chance why are military events , in particular , so unpredictable ?
it is because the events of war are driven by the strange interaction of three completely different kinds of forces .
unpredictability is also down to sheer chance : does it rain the night before your great offensive ?
the first is the rational calculations of the opposing leaders .
given that they actively seek to frustrate and fool one another , it should not surprise us that they routinely succeed in derailing each other 's visions of the future .
the second force is the gut emotions of leaders and the populations they try to control .
hatred makes people do things not remotely in their own predictable ' best interests ' , as understood by any rational standard .
and a third source of unpredictability is sheer chance : does it rain the night before your great offensive is to begin - and did you know that your new artillery fuzes do n't function well when they land in mud ?
victory by accident , not design these sources of uncertainty interact with one another , sometimes vastly increasing the effect .
consider the possible impact of a chance occurrence , say , that a stray bomb -lrb- or an earthquake -rrb- had killed osama bin laden on the first night of air raids on afghanistan .
consider the impact of a chance occurrence , say , that a stray bomb -lrb- or an earthquake -rrb- had killed bin laden american leaders probably would have recognised it as an unbelievable stroke of luck - though they would be fools to say so and us air force budgeteers would have immediately sought the credit and bigger budgets .
everyone else would have assumed it was intentional .
this would have vastly increased the paranoia of those who had already suspected the feds knew where everybody was at every moment .
allies might have been so impressed that they dropped out of the anti-terrorism effort - after all , the americans did n't need any help from them .
it might have paralyzed the terrorist leadership , who certainly understand the value of terror .
but it would also have made american citizens cocky and dismissive of their leaders ' pleas for more patience , internal security , and funding of necessary conventional forces .
who knows what its emotional effect on the muslim masses might have been ?
would they be overawed by american power , or infuriated and driven to even deeper , more opaque conspiracies ?
would the long-term result be to strengthen or to weaken the us position ?
do you know ?
i do n't .
strategy a ' poor bet ' because of these interactions between the opponents and among the forces of reason , emotion and chance , military strategy is by its very nature a poor bet .
even in an ideal case , strategy has a dubious success rate of 50 % assume the simplest possible military problem , army a versus army b in a one-on-one contest in which one side wins in a single clash of arms .
even then , strategy has a dubious success rate of 50 % .
in the real world , wars seldom involve only two players , very seldom are won by either side using its initial strategy , and frequently lack any clear winner at all .
in most cases , the surviving strategists are n't even the ones who started the war in the first place - the originators having fallen to bullets , internal intrigues , or revolutions .
consider this : my father was born in 1917 , when europe was ruled by kaisers , czars , and sultans .
those emperors are gone , victims of wars they set in motion themselves .
they were replaced by revolutionaries , then by führers , duces , party general secretaries , and most recently by elected yuppies .
the mighty third reich , passionately defended by millions of true believers and the most formidable armies the modern world has ever seen , lasted 12 years .
the soviet union lasted less than a single human lifetime .
had someone told you -lrb- or the cia -rrb- in 1979 that a soviet invasion of afghanistan would : a -rrb- be defeated , b -rrb- lead to the collapse of the soviet union within a dozen years , and c -rrb- set the stage for demolition of the world trade center in 2001 , you -lrb- and the cia -rrb- probably would have suggested medication .
but in the end , my father outlived the ussr by more than a decade .
' action is imperative ' so no one knows - or can know - how the current crisis will turn out .
objectively , then , it is safe to say that warfare is an extraordinarily risky ' instrument of policy ' .
the effective strategist makes plans , but does not delude himself that they will unfold as intended the inherent unpredictability of war should not be mistaken , however , as an excuse for pacifism or as a reason not to act .
neither is it a reason for timid or insubstantial action .
confronted by barbarism , a civilised society must fight or die .
indeed , the unpredictability of war makes action imperative .
oftentimes , the bold , sweeping action is the safest course .
sometimes , such bold action is necessary even when it opens nasty cans of worms we 'd prefer to avoid , if those cans are likely destined to be opened anyway and under less favourable conditions .
what war 's fundamental unpredictability does mean is that strategy is a full-time , ongoing job that never ends .
the effective strategist makes plans , but does not delude himself that they will unfold as intended .
he constantly envisions what 's desirable , pursues - and protects against - what 's possible , acts on what 's probable , and constantly adjusts for what actually happens .
and he never gives up .
eventually , someone will get it right .
we 'd damned well better make certain that it 's us .
