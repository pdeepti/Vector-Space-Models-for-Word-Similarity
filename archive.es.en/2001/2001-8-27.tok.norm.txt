" talks are under way with foreign creditors who have threatened to declare hynix in default as early as this week , " said hynix spokeswoman kang in-young .
the nine foreign banks made the move because hynix , formerly hyundai electronics , separated from the parent group on 1 august , she said .
the bankruptcy deadline follows the unravelling of a deal - agreed just last week - for american insurer aig to restructure hyundai group 's three financial businesses after wrangling about the price .
court complications the nine banks - led by societe generale of france - include hsbc , chase manhattan and arab bank .
one solution to the debt crisis which has been mooted is for hynix to issue 1.5 trillion won -lrb- $ 1.18bn -rrb- in new shares which would be offered to its creditors in a debt for equity swap .
but domestic and foreign creditors may not be equally willing to accept the plan .
an official from hynix 's major domestic creditor , korea exchange bank , confirmed talks are taking place on a debt for equity swap .
the hyundai investment trust company was among the three sold " if creditors fail to reach agreement on debt rescheduling we can consider court receivership as a worst case scenario " , the keb official said .
but foreign creditors fear they will not get their money back under a court receivership and so are moving to declare hynix in default , analysts said .
shares slide any new shares are unlikely to be worth much .
on monday , hynix 's shares slumped to 1,175 won , below their face value of 5,000 won -lrb- $ 3.9 -rrb- , and down from 1,330 won on friday .
hynix 's problems follow wrangling over whether american insurer aig will go ahead with an agreement to buy three hyundai financial businesses for $ 860m .
the row about the price emerged just hours after the deal was signed on 24 august .
investors are still waiting to see it the deal will go ahead .
hynix has a 41 % stake in hyundai securities , one of the businesses for sale , which is south korea 's second biggest brokerage and threatened with liquidation if the sale to aig collapses .

in a newspaper article on monday , he says minority communities are an intrinsic part of modern britain .
the charges against me are predictable rubbish iain duncan smith the remarks are being seen as an attempt to draw a line under the events which led to the expulsion of a campaign team member , whose son runs the british national party .
the comments coincide with a meeting on monday night where both mr duncan smith and his rival , ken clarke , will meet asian conservatives .
' open to everyone ' writing in the times newspaper , mr duncan smith describes himself as a " one nation " tory who will make the party more welcoming to black and asian members .
" under my leadership , the conservative party will be open to everyone , whatever their colour , background , class or lifestyle , " he writes .
" british asians already share our values and outlook , as their commitment to family life indicates ; british blacks , too must be made at home in the tory family . "
labour party ' smear ' the shadow defence secretary brands suggestions that he is attracting extremists as " predictable rubbish " emanating from the labour party .
his riposte follows a plea from the conservative peer , lord taylor of warwick , to the tory leadership candidates to act on their pledges to rid the party of far-right sympathisers .
on sunday , a senior supporter of mr clarke said the former chancellor would act as " a purging agent " to rid the party of right-wingers .
the comments came in the wake of the expulsion of edgar griffin from the conservative party because of his links with the far right last week .
mr duncan smith had immediately sacked 79-year-old mr griffin , whose son nick griffin is chairman of the british national party , as a vice-president of his leadership campaign when the links were revealed .
in his newspaper article , the shadow defence secretary promises any conservative party member with links to the bnp will be " out of his ear " under his leadership .
lord taylor on sunday described the purge pledges from both contenders as " nice words " but said the conservatives had so far shown little inclination to take action against racists .
' cancer of racism ' he told bbc news : " iain duncan smith was part of the leadership team who did absolutely nothing about racism .
" he was part of the leadership campaign responsible for william hague 's ' foreign land ' speech .
he is tainted by association . "
on mr duncan smith 's rival , the peer said : " kenneth clarke must not be smug and complacent because the edgar griffin incident is not only a stain on iain duncan smith 's reputation but it is a stain on the conservative party 's reputation . "
lord taylor added : " race will come back time and time again to hound the conservative party .
it is a cancer that is in the body that will spread and eventually kill the conservative party . "
monday 's meeting between the two leadership contenders and asian members of the conservative party is a long-standing engagement for both candidates but it now has added significance .
the meeting comes after shadow home secretary ann widdecombe , a supporter of mr clarke , described the leadership contest as " probably " the nastiest she had witnessed .
and acting tory chairman david prior told monday 's financial times both candidates should concentrate on the real issues , arguing the arguments about the past and personalities should never have started .

officially published figures also recorded a 75 % increase in the amount of heroin seized compared with the same period in 2000 .
the disclosures came ahead of a high-level meeting in beijing on tuesday , where representatives from china , burma , laos and thailand will discuss ways to increase cross-border co-operation in the fight against the drugs trade .
the thai delegate to the meeting said the number of smuggling routes through the region was increasing , as was the production of drugs in the border areas between the countries .
he also called for a clampdown on the transfer of chemicals needed to create so-called designer drugs such as ice and ecstasy from china to the other countries .
drug seizures china 's official news agency , xinhua , said the amount of opium seized more than doubled to almost two tonnes , and said it saw a third more drug cases in the same period .
chinese nightclubs are part of an increasing drug culture china recently marked world anti-drugs day by executing around 60 traffickers .
it has also sent more than 60,000 drug users to compulsory rehabilitation centres and another 11,000 addicts to labour re-education camps this year .
in recent years , china has suffered a steep increase in drug abuse and drug-related crime , due in part to the easy availability of heroin from burma , laos and thailand .
last year , china warned it could not cope with the quantities of drugs entering its borders , and called for more international co-operation .
since then , burma has sent a wanted trafficker back to china , and china has arrested a number of suspected burmese drug smugglers .

"
an unemployed , divorced father from the state of kentucky has come forward as one of the four winners of a $ 294.8m us lottery .
" i was just stunned .
i just praised god and jesus , " david edwards , a recently laid-off fibre-optics technician , told the daily independent of ashland , kentucky .
i said to myself , i 'm going to look at the numbers and the first ones that come to mind , those are the ones i 'm gonna pick david edwards , apparent winner three other winning tickets in the powerball lottery were sold in new hampshire , delaware and minnesota but their owners have not yet claimed their prizes .
of those states , delaware has a law allowing the winner to remain anonymous .
the names of the three other winners will be made public after they step forward .
mr edwards , a 46-year-old father of an 11-year-old girl , said he bought the winning ticket saturday night at clark 's pump n ' shop near ashland , in northeast kentucky .
winner advised ' get a lawyer ' kentucky lottery officials confirmed that the winning ticket was bought in that shop , but did not say whether it was mr edwards .
" obviously , the individual is very excited in winning the prize , " kentucky lottery president and chief executive arch gleason told a news conference .
mr gleason revealed only that the winner was a male resident of kentucky , and that his winning ticket was validated at the store on sunday .
hoping to get lucky despite odds of 80 million to one he said he advised the winner to talk to a lawyer and accountant , and instructed him to bring his ticket to the state lottery headquarters in louisville , so his win could be made official .
" i think he 's got a tight grip on -lsb- the ticket -rsb- , " mr gleason said .
" i do n't think anyone could pry that out of his hands . "
each of the lottery 's four winners will receive $ 73.7 million , or $ 2.9 million per year for 25 years as an annuity .
mr edwards said that part of the money would go to treat his ex-wife , who has been battling lupus for 12 years , and some would pay for surgery on his own bad back .
but on sunday , mr edwards was spotted driving a silver convertible mercedes-benz with his fiancee .
he told the newspaper a friend had loaned him the car " until i can get one of my own " .
random numbers mr edwards said he had bought $ 8 worth of tickets and chose the numbers at random .
" i said to myself , i 'm going to look at the numbers and the first ones that come to mind , those are the ones i 'm gonna pick , " he said .
the winning numbers drawn saturday night in des moines , iowa , were 8-17-22-42-47 plus the extra powerball number of 21 .
sales were stronger than expected just before the drawing and boosted the jackpot to $ 295 million , just $ 700,000 shy of the second-largest lottery payout in us history .
the biggest powerball jackpot ever won was $ 295.7m by a group of factory workers in ohio .
the record for the biggest lottery win in the us is the $ 363m big game jackpot won last year by two players in michigan and illinois .
the odds of winning the powerball are one in 80 million .
winning tickets lottery spokesman joe mahoney told the bbc he was pleased that the huge win was split among several people .
one winning ticket was sold at a cumberland farms store in rollingsford , new hampshire , a town of 2,700 people near the maine border .
an employee of the store said she had received a call notifying her of the win .
maura mccann , spokeswoman for the new hampshire lottery , said the lottery commission had informed her there was a winner .
" i was thrilled , absolutely thrilled , " she said .
the store owner will get 1 % of the value of the winning ticket , up to a limit of $ 30,000 .
