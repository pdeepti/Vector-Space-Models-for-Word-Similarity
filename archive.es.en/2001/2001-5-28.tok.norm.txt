the number of managers working six days a week has fallen from one-in-five three years ago to one-in-10 today , a report by business magazine management today said .
and one-in-five executives works more than 50 hours a week , compared with a quarter three years ago .
but business leaders are proving unwilling to let this relaxation in working culture spread lower down the company hierarchy .
the battle to win more flexible working practices throughout firms has reached a " stalemate " , with high demand among employees for reform , but few organisations offering what staff want , the magazine said .
and more than half of the 1,200 managers interviewed believes that government efforts to tip the balance between work and home lives away from the company grindstone will fail .
" the findings show that the demand for flexible working is high , but the barriers are failing to shift , " said penny de valk , managing director of ceridian performance partners , which helped conduct the survey .
rufus olins , management today 's editor , said : " for many people , balance is no longer seen as an aspiration but as an entitlement . "
fewer managers seemed to be prepared to make sacrifices , such as working weekends , to meet demands of work .
" they want it all , " mr olins said .

a tenth person was arrested on sunday as authorities continue to investigate the cause of the disaster which killed 23 people and injured scores of others .
two opposition members on jerusalem 's city council said in a statement that mr olmert - a member of prime minister ariel sharon 's likud party - allowed businesses in jerusalem to operate without permits and supervision .
but mr olmert , quoted by maariv newspaper , said he had no intention of resigning because he had a " clear conscience " .
the liberal ha 'aretz newspaper also criticised the mayor .
it added that the disaster reflected a combination of professional negligence , illegal operations and flouting of the business licensing laws .
a local jerusalem weekly newspaper under the headline ' olmert must go ' said the mayor must bear the responsibility for tragedy .
engineering fault mr sharon said the government would meet on tuesday to consider launching an official investigation .
the arrests of 10 people come amid growing public anger over allegations of shoddy construction in the hall , which had stood for 15 years in the talpiot industrial park .
police and army officials have said an engineering fault was responsible for the collapse .
the top floor of the wedding venue , the versailles hall , buckled under hundreds of guests sending them plunging three storeys to the ground .
memorial service shards of glass and debris rained down on the injured .
those detained include the hall 's owners , two contractors , and the inventor of a light-weight construction material used in many israeli buildings since the 1980s but since banned .
a bbc correspondent in jerusalem says some of the detained could face charges of causing death through negligence .
on sunday , seven more victims of the tragedy were to be buried , including a couple who were due to get married next month .
they were found in the rubble embracing each other .
more than 160 people remain in hospital , including 16 who are in serious condition .
on saturday , the army called off a round-the-clock search for survivors , saying that all wedding guests and employees had been accounted for .
rescue workers and israeli officials held a memorial service for the dead amid the rubble and twisted metal .

refugee groups have accused the authorities of brutality , claiming women and children were beaten and handcuffed during the raid at the port hedland centre in western australia in which 22 asylum seekers were arrested and a cache of home-made weapons seized .
an immigration department spokesman said they were suspected of starting a riot at the camp two weeks ago .
the group representing palestinian refugees inside the port hedland centre is claiming that around 200 detainees , including children , are on hunger strike .
riot shields it says they will continue their protest until those arrested on saturday are released and charges against them dropped .
the immigration department estimates that about 50 people are involved in the hunger strike .
those held are due before magistrates later on monday .
they were arrested after an operation by 170 police and guards , equipped with riot shields , guns and batons .
refugee groups say police handcuffed women and children and stormed a room used as a mosque .
but australia 's immigration minister philip ruddock , has rejected allegations that his officers were heavy-handed and used excessive force .
mr ruddock said all but one of the 22 arrested suspects had their petitions for refugee status rejected before the disturbance earlier this month and were due to be sent home soon .
' breach of rights ' at least six riots have occurred in the past year at the country 's network of camps for asylum seekers .
australia has detained all illegal immigrants since 1994 .
many are from the middle east or west asia .
they often arrive by boat , smuggled by criminal gangs operating out of indonesia .
their period of incarceration can last from a few weeks to years while their requests for refugee status are considered .

mr koizumi was speaking after residents of the village of kariwamura in north-western japan voted in a referendum to reject plans by the giant tokyo electric power company -lrb- tepco -rrb- to use recycled plutonium fuel at a local plant .
both the state and the operators need to make further efforts in seeking the public 's understanding on nuclear energy japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi critics have said the proposed use of the controversial fuel , known as mox , is dangerous and more expensive than conventional nuclear fuel .
correspondents have said the vote in kariwamura - although not legally binding - has put the japanese government in a dilemma because it wants to make the use of mox a cornerstone of its energy policy .
mr koizumi told the country 's lower house of parliament : " both the state and the operators need to make further efforts in seeking the public 's understanding on nuclear energy . "
previous nuclear accidents are one reason the japanese are sceptical about government nuclear power tepco 's plan was to convert what is an existing nuclear reactor to a pluthermal -lrb- plutonium thermal -rrb- plant .
pluthermal facilities are power plants that use plutonium-uranium mixed oxide -lrb- mox -rrb- fuel in light-water reactors .
of the 3,605 votes cast in kariwamura , 1,925 , or 53.6 % , rejected the use of mox fuel .
japanese newspapers said the vote dealt a severe blow to the government 's plan to promote the method of power generation as an answer to the needs of the resource-poor nation .
the decision -lrb- to accept such a plan -rrb- is up to the local community .
but we will continue to seek understanding about the necessity of pluthermal facilities tepco spokesman takashi kurita japan relies on 51 nuclear reactors to provide about one-third of its electricity .
a spokesman for tepco , takashi kurita , said the company would not continue with its plan to introduce mox fuel against local residents ' wishes .
but tepco would keep trying to win them round he said .
perhaps the government needed to explain more about the plan , although it had taken considerable pains to do so chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda " the decision -lrb- to accept such a plan -rrb- is up to the local community .
but we will continue to seek understanding about the necessity of pluthermal facilities , " he said .
chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda gave no hint that the government would be swayed from its nuclear power plans .
" perhaps the government needed to explain more about the plan , although it had taken considerable pains to do so , " he told a news conference .
" -lrb- plans for new pluthermal plants -rrb- are a very important part of japan 's energy policy .
" considering the future energy needs , i feel we must seek better understanding not just from the residents -lrb- in kariwamura -rrb- , but also the entire japanese public . "

mahant nritya gopal das , who is leading a campaign to build a temple on the site of an ancient mosque , was attacked while on his way with five companions to bathe in a nearby river .
he has been admitted to hospital along with his associates and a private security guard , but his condition is not said to be serious .
" he has lacerations in the legs .
we have done an x-ray and are waiting to see if there are any splinters , " dr an singh told the associated press .
temple campaign mr das is a member of the hardline vishwa hindu parishad -lrb- world hindu council -rrb- and is one of the leaders of a group that has pledged to build a temple on the ruins of a mosque in the town of ayodhya .
the 16th century babri mosque was demolished in 1992 by hindu zealots who believe the site marks the birthplace of the hindu god , ram .
mr das is one of several people - including three members of india 's federal cabinet - who face charges of inciting the mob that razed the mosque .
the destruction led to large-scale communal violence across india in which 2,000 people died .
' local dispute ' another vhp leader connected with the campaign was targeted in a similar attack last year but with a more sophisticated device .
however , police say their initial suspicion is that the latest attack may have less to do with the ayodhya issue than with local disputes over temple property that flare up from time to time .
" such infightings are rather common amongst the holy men in this temple town , " ayodhya district magistrate archana agarwal said .
the vhp is now calling for a tightening up of security which was recently reduced by the state government .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- bird-breeding system off to a flier low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's willie johnston reports " a significant breakthrough . " real 56k monday , 28 may , 2001 , 10:07 gmt 11:07 uk bird-breeding system off to a flier thor was conceived through the use of frozen sperm two scottish bird-breeding experts have been celebrating the birth of the world 's first eaglet through the insemination of frozen sperm .
biologist dr graham wishart and falconer andrew knowles-brown were behind the breakthrough which led to the birth of thor , eight days ago .
the eaglet , born at mr knowles-brown 's farm at elvanfoot in south lanarkshire , is also the world 's first bird of prey not to be born in a laboratory after insemination with cryopreserved -lrb- frozen -rrb- sperm .
dr wishart , of the university of abertay , dundee , and internationally-renowned falconer mr knowles-brown believe the breakthrough could help safeguard endangered birds of prey across the world .
the eagle is being hand reared dr wishart said : " artificial insemination of birds of prey using cryopreserved sperm has only been achieved twice before - both times by us based scientists . "
these birds were an american kestrel and peregrine falcon .
dr wishart continued : " we are particularly excited about thor 's birth because it shows that this complex science can be taken out of the laboratory and used by falconers and other aviculturalists in the field .
" we hope that our research will help safeguard endangered birds of prey such as the golden eagle . "
the two experts had been working on the project for nearly four years before thor was born to father tallin , a five-year-old golden eagle and mother meg , an eight-year-old steppe eagle .
thor 's mum meg is a steppe eagle mr knowles-brown 's sheep farm was 15 miles from a foot-and-mouth outbreak in moffat , which meant dr wishart was unable to visit the farm to oversee key aspects of the process .
instead the duo met at a service station where dr wishart gave his colleague the chemicals and a set of detailed protocols to follow in order to successfully freeze the sperm .
mr knowles-brown explained : " graham and i were in contact via email and telephone every day prior to artificial insemination of the eagle .
" he had devised a new approach this time , which involved freezing the sperm slowly to minus 20 degrees celsius by placing the sperm samples in an insulated box that could be held within a domestic freezer .
" i then immersed the frozen sperm in liquid nitrogen for later use .
thor 's dad tallin is a golden eagle " this is an important extra tool that can be used to build up endangered bird populations in the relative safety of captivity before releasing them back into the wild .
" as eagles in the wild only increase their populations very slowly any captive manipulation which can rapidly produce offspring for release can only be of benefit to that species or any bird species . "
he said the benefit of the use of cryopreserved sperm is that the sperm can be kept indefinitely .
mr knowles-brown added : " one could envisage a situation where a particular species of bird of prey was in danger of extinction but the best chance of its survival came from artificially inseminating a bird in australia with the sperm of a bird in the uk .
" with the technology demonstrated in our new system this is now a possibility . "
