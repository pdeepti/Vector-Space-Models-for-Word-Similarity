the council has suggested that the un should send a new mission to the country to make a comprehensive assessment at the security situation and come up with new proposals on how the un can assist the transitional government in the demobilisation of somali militia groups and the training of a national police force .
many families are close to starvation diplomats say the more proactive approach by the council is a reflection of growing concern about the threat that failed states like somalia present to global security .
like afghanistan , somalia is viewed by many un diplomats as a failed state , a place where efforts to establish a truly national government are weak , and where heavily armed militia remain in control of large parts of the country .
greater aid needed earlier this month a representative of the somali transitional government told the security council that if his calls for greater aid and assistance were ignored , somalia could become another haven for international terrorist groups and drug traffickers .
that stark warning did not go unnoticed .
in a response to this and in earlier reports submitted by the office of the un secretary general , the council has recommended a series of measures designed to shore up the fragile peace process in somalia .
security assessment it has proposed a un mission to the country to make a country-wide security assessment .
it also suggests the un should consider how it can provide further assistance in the demobilisation of militia members and the training of a somali national police force .
somalia has been without a central government since 1991 the council also urges support for the somali transitional government 's efforts to control international terrorism and urges a newly set up terrorism committee to provide assistance in this regard .
somalia may benefit from a new mindset in the international community which was shocked by the events of 11 september and is now aware that failed states are ignored at the world 's peril .

mr peres said on israeli television that he had prepared a draft plan which he wanted to hear comments on - but only after it was seen by mr sharon .
mr peres refused to confirm a newspaper report -lrb- in the maariv daily -rrb- that his plan included the dismantling of jewish settlements in the gaza strip - a proposal which has been strongly opposed in the past by mr sharon .
mr sharon is also reported to object to a meeting reportedly planned by mr peres with the palestinian leader , yasser arafat , during an economic conference on the spanish island of majorca at the weekend .
no negotiations mr peres said the meeting would probably take place : " we shall probably meet , but we are not going to negotiate because i think that negotiations should be prepared very carefully , otherwise it will create a disappointment instead of a hope . "
speaking from rome where he met pope john paul ii and italian leaders , mr arafat said he was not opposed to the meeting .
the two men met on 26 september in gaza , when they spoke of their commitment to an israeli-palestinian ceasefire .
since then , an israeli cabinet minister has been killed by palestinian gunmen , and israeli troops have moved back into parts of the west bank , causing an upsurge in violence that left many dead on both sides .

mr peres said on israeli television that he had prepared a draft plan which he wanted to hear comments on - but only after it was seen by mr sharon .
yasser arafat : weekend meeting with peres mr peres refused to confirm a newspaper report -lrb- in the maariv daily -rrb- that his plan included the dismantling of jewish settlements in the gaza strip - a proposal which has been strongly opposed in the past by mr sharon .
mr sharon is also reported to object to a meeting reportedly planned by mr peres with the palestinian leader , yasser arafat , during an economic conference on the spanish island of majorca at the weekend .
no negotiations mr peres said the meeting would probably take place : " we shall probably meet , but we are not going to negotiate because i think that negotiations should be prepared very carefully , otherwise it will create a disappointment instead of a hope . "
speaking from rome where he met pope john paul ii and italian leaders , mr arafat said he was not opposed to the meeting .
the two men met on 26 september in gaza , when they spoke of their commitment to an israeli-palestinian ceasefire .
since then , an israeli cabinet minister has been killed by palestinian gunmen , and israeli troops have moved back into parts of the west bank , causing an upsurge in violence that left many dead on both sides .

students would have to do a one-year foundation course , run by the open university , with placements in exeter and plymouth .

the peninsula medical school , which starts lectures next year , has been recruiting experts in arts and education to stimulate students into new ways of thinking .
students will have contact with patients far earlier than at traditional schools , where training is purely academically-based for the first two years .
the school , still under construction in exeter and plymouth , has begun processing applications for the first intake of 127 future medics - it says it has already had sufficient interest to fill every place several times over .
extra doctors it is doing " as well or better " than established schools .
interviews for places will begin in three weeks ' time and offers will be sent out by december .
the school is being established by the universities of exeter and plymouth and the open university .
it is part of a government strategy to train an extra 950 doctors a year to make up shortages .
radical new methods proposed by the three universities include distance learning .
places are open to graduates who do not have a health-related degree .
the universities say the policy will open the medical profession to people from different backgrounds .
students would have to do a one-year foundation course , run by the open university , with placements in exeter and plymouth .
students who completed the foundation course successfully would then go on to a more clinically-based training course , with emphasis on placements in the community - at nhs trusts and gp practices .
nurse training nine health trusts are supporting the new school .
a new medical school building and health studies instituted is also being created close to the royal cornwall hospital 's accident and emergency department .
from 2004 , students with two years ' training with study at truro alongside nurses .
the new school received £ 700,000 earlier this year from the vandervell foundation .
the foundation was set up in the will of the 60s racing driver tony vandervell .
the money was given to fund research by young scientists .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- sir peter bonfield : a profile categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 31 october , 2001 , 07:37 gmt sir peter bonfield : a profile sir peter bonfield : " fasten your seatbelts " by bbc news online 's mike verdin sir peter bonfield promised a " rollercoaster ride " when he became chief executive of bt in 1996 .
and , in terms of the bt 's share price , that is precisely what his reign has delivered .
from a price of less than £ 4 when sir peter joined , bt stock clunked its way to a peak of more than £ 15 in december 1999 , since when it has plunged and twisted back to current levels of around £ 5 .
sir peter had warned observers : " fasten your seatbelts " .
but it is little wonder that investors who locked into bt holdings are questioning whether they have been taken for a ride , rather than enjoying one .
computer pioneers sir peter , who prides himself on a matter-of-fact manner , gained his ' estuary ' accent from an upbringing in hertfordshire .
but his interest in technology goes back at least to time at loughborough university , from where he graduated with an engineering degree .
his early career included spells in some of the biggest names in the nascent computer industry , including texas instruments , with whom he served in the far east , europe and the us , stc and , from 1981 , icl .
he helped oversee icl 's transformation from a mainframe specialist into a computer networking pioneer , and in the 1990s into a leading pc manufacturer .
' biggest test ' he had earned his cbe by 1989 , long before he was snapped up by a flagging bt keen to tap his " international experience , his dedication to quality management , and his in-depth knowledge of the computing services industry " .
but , ironically , it was in his international dealings , in the same us market which had proved his making two decades earlier , that sir peter first hinted he might struggle to fulfil the high expectations placed on him by city investors .
in 1997 , standard life 's graham wood spoke for many fund managers when he said that the " biggest test " for sir peter would be how he handled bt 's plans to takeover us telecoms firm mci .
the merger was designed , in sir iain vallance 's words , to create " one of the first great companies of the 21st century " , which would deliver expansion on a global scale .
as it was , sir peter , using the excuse of shareholder pressure , lopped $ 4bn off bt 's offer after mci issued an earnings warning .
and mci was snapped from beneath his nose by worldcom .
mounting debts while bt has notched up considerable successes under sir peter 's leadership , and seen its shares triple in price during the two years to the end of 1999 , the firm has been criticised for not using its seemingly indomitable position in the middle of the decade to greater effect .
the company could have exploited advances in internet and mobile telephony technology , many analysts have said .
bt , while owning the successful cellnet mobile phone arm , has a stock market valuation less than a third that boasted by vodafone .
and , while it seems hard to believe today , when bt is among firms most troubled by borrowings incurred buying 3g mobile phone licences , the firm was virtually debt free at the time the mci deal collapsed .
sharp edge ?
according to newspaper reports , sir peter keeps in his office a samurai sword given to him by fujitsu .
earlier this year , when investors lost their patience , bt 's chairman sir iain vallance was forced to go .
peter bonfield stayed on , trying to reduce the firm 's debt burden without scuppering its chances for growth .
now sir peter has had to fall on his corporate blade as well .
