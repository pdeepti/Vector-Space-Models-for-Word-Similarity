the finance minister , xiang huaicheng , told delegates on the second day of the annual session of the national people 's congress the military budget would rise this year by 17.7 % to about $ 17bn .
he said the increase , which is set to continue for the next five years , would go towards higher pay and new equipment .
western analysts say the move indicates a significant change in chinese strategic thinking after nato 's intervention in kosovo , which circumvented the united nations security council , where china has a veto .
mr xiang said the extra defence spending was needed to " adapt to drastic changes in the military situation of the world and prepare for defence and combat given the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology . "
taiwan factor the election of taiwanese president chen shui-bian and india 's missile programme are also likely to have played a part in the increase .
president chen has in the past been a firm supporter of taiwanese independence but china has threatened invasion should taiwan move in that direction .
the us is obliged under the taiwan relations act to make available sufficient arms to allow the island to defend itself .
shrinking numbers the chineseprime minister , zhu rongji briefly referred to taiwan on monday but his remarks sounded conciliatory compared with his blistering rhetoric of a year ago .
he said china would pursue reunification with taiwan , which beijing regards as a renegade province , but there was no actual mention of the use of force .
the chinese military has reduced in size from about 4.2 million personnel to about 2.5 million over the last two decades .
it has also been told by president jiang zemin to withdraw from its web of business interests , but observers say the army has retained involvement .

local authorities in the highlands and argyll and bute are setting up disinfectant roadblocks on trunk roads - despite some opposition to the move .
eight scottish cases have been confirmed eight cases of the disease have now been confirmed north of the border , and tests results are awaited at other premises .
farmers are particularly worried about a suspected outbreak near eyemouth in berwickshire , where there are pigs as well as cattle and sheep .
pigs develop the disease very quickly and are particularly contagious .
there are also fears that the deep snow drifts which cut off many communities in the borders may have disguised the extent of foot-and-mouth in the area .
many farmers there buy their sheep from the longtown market in cumbria .

but it has changed direction and there are fears it could blow the infection into the central belt of scotland .
two councils are to disinfect traffic despite the concerns , livestock movements under licence have been increasing across scotland .
about 100 licences have been issued by councils in aberdeenshire , orkney and the borders .
these allow the movement of animals under strict supervision , with cows , pigs and sheep being taken to abattoirs for slaughter .
the scottish executive said the scheme was necessary to ease pressure on farmers and start getting meat back into the food chain .
five abattoirs in aberdeenshire resumed production on monday .
and supermarket giant asda said pork from pigs slaughtered at an abattoir in buckie , which was among the grampian premises granted a special licence , would go on sale on tuesday at stores in scotland and the north of england .

no one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack on the bbc building .
the red cab driver is believed to have ' cut up ' a motorist police believe that the driver of the red taxi that carried the bomb was involved in a ' road rage ' incident with another motorist .
deputy assistant commissioner alan fry , of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist branch , said the bomber may have been involved in an argument with another driver in scrubs lane , white city , before the blast .
police want to hear from anyone who saw the red taxi , which was bought from a car yard in edmonton , north london , the day before the attack .
mr fry said that the man who sold the taxi , registration number d902 gyh , had described the buyer as 6ft tall , aged about 30 , with a northern irish accent , and wearing a short jacket and a baseball cap .
uk-wide alert major political parties in northern ireland are to meet to discuss the future of the peace process - but downing street said this is unrelated to the bomb attack .
police forces across the uk have remained on full alert .
officers are linking the bombing of the bbc to three previous attacks last year in west london .
these were the bomb left on hammersmith bridge , the device found on railway tracks at acton and the rocket-launched missile attack on the mi6 headquarters in central london .
but they are still investigating whether the incident is linked to an explosion in a street behind the bbc 's white city facilities in february in which a 14-year-old army cadet was blinded .

they thought the authorities were best placed to support schools in difficulties , make arrangements for excluded pupils , organise school transport and plan for the supply of school places .
there was a split between primary schools and secondaries - with almost two thirds of the secondary heads wanting greater delegation of money and responsibilities .
the poll of 1,000 primary , secondary and special school head teachers was carried out by mori for the department for education .
the education secretary , david blunkett , plans to use the findings in a speech on tuesday to the adam smith institute think tank .
' ideological preconceptions ' he is expected to say they show the need for a balance between central government intervention and local autonomy in reforming education .
" the right balance is not impossible , " he will say - giving as an example the national literacy and numeracy strategies in primary schools .
" our balanced approach may challenge old ideological preconceptions about the role of government - but it is working and we are determined to continue to change the culture of our education system so that it can be truly world class . "
the findings take on a political significance in view of the conservative " free schools " policy , which would give head teachers far more control over what they do .
when the pollsters asked who should carry out functions such as school transport , special needs and excluded pupils , between 68 % and 86 % thought local education authorities -lrb- leas -rrb- should - rather than schools themselves or , for example , the education department .
more delegation one of the options was " groups of schools " .
the shadow education secretary , theresa may , has spoken of " clusters " of schools coming together to buy services under a conservative government .
this option typically found favour with only a few per cent of the head teachers .
but 41 % wanted to see greater delegation of funding and responsibilities from their lea - although there was a marked split between primary schools -lrb- 37 % -rrb- and secondaries -lrb- 61 % -rrb- .
premises and liability insurance were functions they wanted control over - definitely not the maintenance of grounds and buildings .
just over half wanted to take on responsibility for special educational needs statementing , which specifies the provision the pupil should have and the type of school they should attend .
responding to the survey , theresa may said conservatives wanted to free schools from the bureaucratic controls of central and local government .
" we are convinced by the experience of grant-maintained schools and from speaking to many head teachers all over the country that devolving power for them to spend money as they see fit is the way forward , " she said .
local authorities would still have a role to play , for example in the statementing of children with special educational needs , but it would be significantly reduced .
direct funding one in five heads wanted " other " things - not specified in the survey - to be delegated .
more than four fifths said they liked the recent trend towards delegating more central funding direct to their schools .
they were using the money for everything from employing teachers and non-teaching staff to buying equipment and repairing buildings .
asked what they thought the future role of leas should be , a quarter opted for " remain as they are " , 27 % " improve , with greater delegation " and 44 % " improve -lrb- but not necessarily with greater delegation -rrb- " .
five per cent wanted to see them abolished .
