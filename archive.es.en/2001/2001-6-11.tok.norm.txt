police were out in force , but the march by the extremist far right group failed to materialise .
the rally passed without incident except for the arrest of two white youths , who were found carrying sellotaped rolls of one pence coins wrapped in white cloths bearing the name of fascist group combat 18 .
the anti-nazi league and local ethnic community have been dismayed by recent election support for the british national party in a town where racial tension sparked rioting last month .
solidarity : hundreds turned up at the peak of the anti-nazi league rally on sunday , up to 300 activists from as far afield as yorkshire and newcastle congregated outside oldham civic centre .
passing motorists were asked to sound their horns in support of the demonstration , which was addressed by trade unionists and councillors from the local asian community .
earlier , hundreds of police officers congregated in a car park next to oldham athletics boundary park ground .
some 30 vans , many fitted with riot shields and two trucks of police horses were assembled on the waste ground .
the national front had threatened to march through the town just days after the british national party achieved their best ever parliamentary result - winning a combined total of more than 11,000 votes in two oldham constituencies .
the party 's election success , which dismayed members of the town 's asian communities , came less than two weeks after vicious racially-fuelled riots .
race riots racial tension in the greater manchester town led to a weekend of race riots last month , the worst seen in britain for 15 years .
petrol bombs were thrown and cars set on fire in three nights of violence in the glodwick area which led to 33 white people and 16 asians being arrested .
days later , the house of the town 's asian deputy mayor was petrol-bombed in an attack police said was racially motivated .
devastation : oldham during the riots tensions increased on friday after 10 muslim gravestones , some belonging to children , were desecrated in a cemetery .
police said the appalling vandalism , in the greenacres area , was being treated as a racist attack and they are now conducting house-to-house inquiries .
racial tension has been high in oldham since reports that asian youths , critical of the police response to attacks on their community , threatened to create " no-go zones " for white people .
the national front has tried to stage several marches in the town , even though the police and the local council last month ordered a ban such activities .
commentators have blamed some right-wing extremists for exploiting tensions between the town 's whites and asians - mainly pakistani , kashmiri and bangladeshi .
the anti-nazi league demonstration broke up shortly after 1600bst , but a heavier than usual police presence was expected to remain on the streets .

i will start attacking police stations and the airport , the government and parliament , everything i can with our 120 mm mortars commander hoxha the rebels have been tightening their grip on a small town only a few kilometres outside the capital , which they seized on friday .
the guerrilla leader , commander hoxha , has set a deadline of early on monday morning , and has threatened attacks on the airport , an oil refinery and a main highway .
the macedonian government has not responded officially to the rebel ultimatum but reports say it has increased security around key facilities .
the united nations refugee agency says that about 7,000 ethnic albanians have meanwhile fled across the border into neighbouring kosovo .
the developments are casting further doubt on a peace deal supported by the european union .
blockade on sunday the rebels of the national liberation army -lrb- nla -rrb- blockaded a road out of their stronghold , the town of aracinovo , close to a checkpoint manned by macedonian security forces .
commander hoxha told journalists he would begin a bombardment unless the macedonian army stopped attacking villages held by the rebels in the north of the country .
" i will start attacking police stations and the airport , the government and parliament - everything i can with our 120mm mortars .
we do n't have many but they are effective .
we will attack from the mountains , " the rebel leader said .
the rebels ' other key demand is to be included in talks on the country 's constitutional future - something explicitly ruled out by the government .
refugee exodus a spokeswoman for the un high commissioner for refugees in kosovo said on sunday that some 7,000 refugees had crossed into the mainly ethnic albanian province of kosovo in serbia by saturday night .
that brings the total number of ethnic albanians who have fled from macedonia into serbia since the present unrest began in february to more than 29,000 , the spokeswoman said .
the rebels say they are fighting to force the government to give macedonia 's substantial ethnic albanian minority equality with the macedonian majority .
the government fears their real aim is to break away and become part of a greater albania .
the european union 's senior security official , javier solana , said on saturday that leaders of all the parties forming macedonia 's national unity government had accepted a plan drawn up by president boris trajkovski to end the conflict .
mr trajkovski 's plan contains an amnesty for rebel fighters but excludes their leaders who " will be eliminated unless they go back where they came from " .
one influential ethnic albanian leader quickly dismissed the president 's proposals as being " too broad " and needing " some corrections " .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- executions out of the ordinary low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo monday , 11 june , 2001 , 05:53 gmt 06:53 uk executions out of the ordinary the electric chair , seen as barbaric , has been largely replaced by lethal injection the death of timothy mcveigh is one of the most high profile executions in american history .
bbc news online 's chris summers looks back at the landmark cases .
salem witchcraft trials long before the united states came into existence , ' americans ' were being put to death in high profile trials .
in 1692 , 19 people were hanged in salem , massachusetts after being convicted of witchcraft .
several others died in prison awaiting trial and another accused , giles corey , died after being interrogated by having stone weights placed on his chest .
karla faye tucker 's born-again christianity did not save her the charges stemmed from the bizarre behaviour of two little girls , whose father and uncle were the town 's minister , reverend samuel parris .
when the hysteria had died down , the governor of massachusetts , william phips , ordered that reliance on spectral and intangible evidence no longer be allowed in trials .
william kemmler in the 19th century the number of executions increased as the us literally got bigger and lawlessness became a greater problem in the " wild west " .
increasingly sophisticated methods , such as the gas chamber and electric chair , were invented in an attempt to create a more humane way of carrying out executions .
on 6 august 1890 william kemmler was the first person to be electrocuted , in auburn prison in new york state .
sacco and vanzetti italian-american anarchists nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti became a cause celebre when they were convicted in 1921 of murdering two men during a robbery in braintree , massachusetts .
in 1925 celestino medeiros , who admitted taking part in the robbery and was also later executed , wrote a letter in which he said sacco and vanzetti were not part of the robbery gang .
but the pair were executed , after a series of appeals , on 23 august 1927 .
vanzetti 's last words were : " i wish to say to you that i am innocent . "
robert alton harris 's execution : first in california for 25 years the executions - by electric chair - were followed by demonstrations in several cities , and a number of prominent writers , including dorothy parker , were arrested for protesting .
there was also violent retribution .
the homes of the executioner , robert elliott , and the judge , webster thayer , were both bombed but neither was hurt .
ruth snyder snyder , a housewife from queens , new york , and her lover judd gray murdered her husband albert .
on 12 january 1928 snyder went to the electric chair at sing sing prison in new york .
photographer thomas howard took a covert picture of the moment of death using a camera secretly strapped to his ankle , and the photo was splashed across the front of the new york daily news .
the picture boosted the paper 's circulation by 750,000 but the daily news only narrowly avoided prosecution .
elaborate precautions were introduced afterwards to stop secret photos being taken .
bruno hauptmann charles lindbergh became one of the most famous men in the world when he flew single-handedly across the atlantic in 1927 .
five years later his world was turned upside down when his infant son , charles jr , was kidnapped from the bedroom of his home in east amwell , new jersey .
a $ 50,000 ransom note was left in the room and although the money was paid , the baby 's body was later found in a nearby wood .
hauptmann was convicted in 1935 after the so-called " trial of the century " and , although he never confessed , was sent to the electric chair on 3 april 1936 .
ethel and julius rosenberg at the height of the cold war , and the mccarthyite witch-hunt , a jewish couple were convicted of passing secrets about the us nuclear bomb to the soviet union .
on 21 june 1953 ethel and julius rosenberg are executed by electric chair .
the case against julius rosenberg was strong , and has been underlined since in several soviet leaders ' memoirs , but the evidence against his wife was weak .
she was the first woman executed by the us government since mary surratt was hanged for her role in the assassination of abraham lincoln .
gary gilmore during the 1950s and 1960s 10 states , including michigan and new york , abolished the death penalty and the rate of executions nationwide began to decline .
by 1968 executions had stopped and in 1972 the supreme court ruled , in the case of furman v georgia , " that the imposition of the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment " .
but 35 states responded by drafting new death penalty statutes and in 1976 the supreme court reversed its decision , ruling that the punishment of death did not violate the constitution provided that " guided discretion " was exercised in imposing it .
gary gilmore chose to waive any appeals against execution in october 1976 gary gilmore was convicted of a double murder in utah and sentenced to death .
gilmore , who had spent much of his life in prison , could not bear the prospect of spending years behind bars and decided not to appeal the sentence .
the american civil liberties union appealed on his behalf - and to his annoyance - but on 17 january 1977 gilmore was executed by firing squad , the first execution in the us for a decade .
norman mailer later wrote a book about gilmore , the executioner 's song , which was made into a tv movie starring tommy lee jones .
robert alton harris in 1979 harris was sentenced to death for the murder of two teenage boys whose car he had stolen .
he was executed on 21 april 1992 in the gas chamber at san quentin state prison in california , the state 's first execution for 25 years .
harris 's last words , quoting a keanu reeves film , were : " you can be a king or a street sweeper , but everyone dances with the grim reaper . "
a federal judge ordered the execution to be filmed so as to decide whether the gas chamber was a " cruel and unusual punishment " .
the tapes were later destroyed .
karla faye tucker women 's groups and evangelist churches sought to save her from execution by lethal injection in february 1998 .
tucker , a prostitute and drug addict , and her boyfriend bludgeoned to death two people in 1983 .
while on death row she became a born-again christian and was forgiven by the brother of one of her victims .
but george w bush , then governor of texas , refused to intervene and she became the first woman to be killed by the state since 1863 .
gary graham in the middle of his presidential campaign , george w bush , refuses to reprieve graham , who is executed by lethal injection at huntstville , texas .
there was widespread disquiet about the evidence which had condemned graham for the murder of a white man .
evidence showing that the gun police found on him could not have fired the fatal bullet had never been put before a jury .
his lawyer richard burr - who has also represented mcveigh - said : " i really believe this man is innocent , and i really believe we are about to murder him because if he is innocent then we are murdering him . "
graham was executed on 22 june 2000 .

bbc news online 's chris summers looks back at the landmark cases .
salem witchcraft trials long before the united states came into existence , ' americans ' were being put to death in high profile trials .
in 1692 , 19 people were hanged in salem , massachusetts after being convicted of witchcraft .
several others died in prison awaiting trial and another accused , giles corey , died after being interrogated by having stone weights placed on his chest .
the charges stemmed from the bizarre behaviour of two little girls , whose father and uncle were the town 's minister , reverend samuel parris .
when the hysteria had died down , the governor of massachusetts , william phips , ordered that reliance on spectral and intangible evidence no longer be allowed in trials .
william kemmler in the 19th century the number of executions increased as the us literally got bigger and lawlessness became a greater problem in the " wild west " .
increasingly sophisticated methods , such as the gas chamber and electric chair , were invented in an attempt to create a more humane way of carrying out executions .
on 6 august 1890 william kemmler was the first person to be electrocuted , in auburn prison in new york state .
sacco and vanzetti italian-american anarchists nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti became a cause celebre when they were convicted in 1921 of murdering two men during a robbery in braintree , massachusetts .
in 1925 celestino medeiros , who admitted taking part in the robbery and was also later executed , wrote a letter in which he said sacco and vanzetti were not part of the robbery gang .
but the pair were executed , after a series of appeals , on 23 august 1927 .
vanzetti 's last words were : " i wish to say to you that i am innocent . "
the executions - by electric chair - were followed by demonstrations in several cities , and a number of prominent writers , including dorothy parker , were arrested for protesting .
there was also violent retribution .
the homes of the executioner , robert elliott , and the judge , webster thayer , were both bombed but neither was hurt .
ruth snyder snyder , a housewife from queens , new york , and her lover judd gray murdered her husband albert .
on 12 january 1928 snyder went to the electric chair at sing sing prison in new york .
photographer thomas howard took a covert picture of the moment of death using a camera secretly strapped to his ankle , and the photo was splashed across the front of the new york daily news .
the picture boosted the paper 's circulation by 750,000 but the daily news only narrowly avoided prosecution .
elaborate precautions were introduced afterwards to stop secret photos being taken .
bruno hauptmann charles lindbergh became one of the most famous men in the world when he flew single-handedly across the atlantic in 1927 .
five years later his world was turned upside down when his infant son , charles jr , was kidnapped from the bedroom of his home in east amwell , new jersey .
a $ 50,000 ransom note was left in the room and although the money was paid , the baby 's body was later found in a nearby wood .
hauptmann was convicted in 1935 after the so-called " trial of the century " and , although he never confessed , was sent to the electric chair on 3 april 1936 .
ethel and julius rosenberg at the height of the cold war , and the mccarthyite witch-hunt , a jewish couple were convicted of passing secrets about the us nuclear bomb to the soviet union .
on 21 june 1953 ethel and julius rosenberg are executed by electric chair .
the case against julius rosenberg was strong , and has been underlined since in several soviet leaders ' memoirs , but the evidence against his wife was weak .
she was the first woman executed by the us government since mary surratt was hanged for her role in the assassination of abraham lincoln .
gary gilmore during the 1950s and 1960s 10 states , including michigan and new york , abolished the death penalty and the rate of executions nationwide began to decline .
by 1968 executions had stopped and in 1972 the supreme court ruled , in the case of furman v georgia , " that the imposition of the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment " .
but 35 states responded by drafting new death penalty statutes and in 1976 the supreme court reversed its decision , ruling that the punishment of death did not violate the constitution provided that " guided discretion " was exercised in imposing it .
in october 1976 gary gilmore was convicted of a double murder in utah and sentenced to death .
gilmore , who had spent much of his life in prison , could not bear the prospect of spending years behind bars and decided not to appeal the sentence .
the american civil liberties union appealed on his behalf - and to his annoyance - but on 17 january 1977 gilmore was executed by firing squad , the first execution in the us for a decade .
norman mailer later wrote a book about gilmore , the executioner 's song , which was made into a tv movie starring tommy lee jones .
robert alton harris in 1979 harris was sentenced to death for the murder of two teenage boys whose car he had stolen .
he was executed on 21 april 1992 in the gas chamber at san quentin state prison in california , the state 's first execution for 25 years .
harris 's last words , quoting a keanu reeves film , were : " you can be a king or a street sweeper , but everyone dances with the grim reaper . "
a federal judge ordered the execution to be filmed so as to decide whether the gas chamber was a " cruel and unusual punishment " .
the tapes were later destroyed .
karla faye tucker women 's groups and evangelist churches sought to save her from execution by lethal injection in february 1998 .
tucker , a prostitute and drug addict , and her boyfriend bludgeoned to death two people in 1983 .
while on death row she became a born-again christian and was forgiven by the brother of one of her victims .
but george w bush , then governor of texas , refused to intervene and she became the first woman to be killed by the state since 1863 .
gary graham in the middle of his presidential campaign , george w bush , refuses to reprieve graham , who is executed by lethal injection at huntstville , texas .
there was widespread disquiet about the evidence which had condemned graham for the murder of a white man .
evidence showing that the gun police found on him could not have fired the fatal bullet had never been put before a jury .
his lawyer richard burr - who has also represented mcveigh - said : " i really believe this man is innocent , and i really believe we are about to murder him because if he is innocent then we are murdering him . "
graham was executed on 22 june 2000 .

the newspaper says mario monti , the eu 's competition commissioner , will tell a consumers ' meeting in stockholm that brussels has written to hollywood film companies asking about dvd pricing policies .
dvds bought in america are cheaper than those available on this side of the atlantic , but will not necessarily work on european dvd players .
dvds cost between £ 13- £ 20 in the uk , while us consumers pay just $ 15- $ 25 -lrb- £ 11- £ 18 -rrb- .
regional system the commission reportedly wants to investigate why the companies divide the world into regions which restrict where a dvd can be played .
film companies have traditionally argued they use the regional system to facilitate the collection of royalties and prevent piracy .
but in previous speeches , mr monti has said there is a fine line between protecting intellectual property and abusing a dominant position .
the eu investigation follows complaints from consumers about high prices and the difficulties of ordering dvds from the us .
the dvd market has grown fourfold in the last two years as consumers replace their videotape collections with the digital discs .

radical proposals to double the number of school terms from three to six have been backed by teachers , pupils and parents , according to a survey for the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- .
the lga asked a total of 2,700 teachers , heads , pupils and parents for their views on the proposals , and said 60 % backed the ideas .
the controversial proposals could end the hayfever misery of high summer exams .
it could also mean a-level students could apply to university after their exams already knowing their grades , because exams would take place earlier .
but the changes would mean the end of the traditional easter holiday - and that has angered church groups .
the current school year was devised more than 100 years ago - so should n't we keep something that has worked for so long ?
or is this the change parents , children and teachers have been waiting for ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction what i would most like to see is the freedom for schools to decide when their holidays are .
that way there wo n't be holiday periods set in stone , and the travel industry would n't be able to rip us off with peak holiday season pricing .
iain friar , uk typically british !
spend more time and waste more money discussing such an issue as holidays instead of addressing the problems of low education standards , heavy bureaucracy and letting teachers teach .
bill , uk i just think that the long summer holiday should be kept because it is the ideal opportunity to go abroad , or on holiday generally .
i live in a multi-cultural city and because some people 's families live in other countries they need a long break to visit their families so the shortening of the holidays would mean that more time is taken off school because the family can not get back in time for the start of term .
elaine white , uk i believe it would be much better for both the students and teachers to retain the current system .
here , in the states , we have the two-week break for the christmas holiday and it goes by way too fast !
children need time to be children with time to play and have fun .
that is as much a part of learning as the formal education .
then , is when we learn many of our social skills and we learn a skill that many people take for granted ... to simply have fun !
life is not meant to be of only serious endeavours .
stephanie , usa the six term year is a great idea .
it would make much more sense to have all the terms of roughly equal length and holidays at roughly the same time .
also , in the current system , the september-october term is often 8 weeks , followed by just one week holiday ; the new system would give a much needed 2 week break in october .
easter is very awkward , because it causes the winter and summer terms to vary , but a simple solution to the church opposition would be to allow church of england schools to retain the present three term system , while other schools changed to the six term system .
e pack , london , uk i suffered horribly during my a-levels lizz , uk it does n't matter how many terms there are , what would be more sensible is to make sure exams are nowhere near the hay-fever season .
i suffered horribly during my a-levels , and not only is it impossible to do your best when you are suffering those symptoms , it is also very distracting for other people .
i see nothing wrong with a long break in the summer as such , just so long as they find some way of stopping the ridiculous system of forcing hay fever sufferers through exams when they are most ill .
even bringing them forward a month or two to april would mean that the worst of it had not set in , and it would be a bit more fair .
lizz , uk to the people complaining about the loss of the summer holiday - have you read the proposals ?
the 6 week summer holiday would remain , although it would move up slightly .
anyone wanting a longer summer holiday - by the end of 10 weeks , you 're sick of it , and you have forgotten half of the past year 's material !
alexis , usa as a pupil , i feel it would help the way we work to have more holidays , more often but for less time .
at the moment the break between the summer and autumn is far too long and i feel we lose previous knowledge , which it then takes teachers two weeks to remind us of .
this is especially true in the gcse course .
susie , uk i would object strongly to changing the present system jenny coppen , uk i would object strongly to changing the present system .
chopping school life into small pieces would be too unsettling for all concerned .
there would be no appreciation of holidays as they would be finished before they started .
too much time would be spent settling in at the beginning and relaxing at the end of each term .
there would be no time for enjoying the long summer holiday and no time for the more social events in term time , when staff and pupils go on adventure weeks or similar such activities .
for many children this can be their first , or indeed only , chance to socialise with others under these circumstances .
all my children have received tremendous benefit from such things .
jenny coppen , uk there is in my opinion a strong argument for a change to the six term format .
i believe that the attention span of children is more compatible with six shorter terms than three longer terms .
it might lead to more information being retained and would allow teachers to spot those pupils who are struggling and give them assistance before they fall too far behind .
it would also reduce the amount of time over the summer when children are left to their own devices , potentially leading to less juvenile delinquency .
it would also make life for parents easier as it would give them wider options as to when they should take family holidays .
mathew rowlands , uk why does the church have to interfere with education in a multi-cultural and multi-religion society ?
the religious aspects of holidays has already been lost .
most people use the time to relax with family , rather than go to church .
s. sahai , uk why spend money on changing the year when there are more important educational needs ?
andy , uk " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " .
the school year may have imperfections , but then so did the rates , and look at the chaos when the poll tax came into being .
this change would cost money - why spend money on changing the year when there are more important educational needs ?
some have mentioned that old truism about hay fever suffering .
hay fever is awful - i suffer from it - but it rarely stops people sitting exams .
holidays - shorter ones with different peak times will mean less well off parents removing their kids from school more frequently to get cheaper off-peak holidays .
anyway , i want my kids to be able to play outdoors in sunny weather .
they 're tested to distraction already , and depriving them of sunlight to " facilitate " exams is madness .
the lga should step back a bit , and get a sense of perspective .
andy , uk i 'm a working parent who takes unpaid leave to cover the summer holidays .
both my children and myself enjoy them and , rather than reduce them , we would like them to be extended to eight weeks -lrb- all of july and august -rrb- .
caron , england a good idea , but the terms should be staggered by a week or two region by region to even out demand for holidays , both in the uk and abroad .
fred , uk all i can say is , that when i was a kid , i 'd have hated the idea of someone depriving me of my six week summer holiday !
jim anderson , uk thank goodness - escaping from the ludicrous three-term system has become a serious proposal at last !
it makes no sense whatsoever to anybody , least of all those giving or receiving education , to have long terms followed by interminable holidays .
spacing terms properly will undoubtedly produce better results and happier students , teachers and parents .
andy millward , uk i was among thousands of students who had homes overseas but went to school in uk .
some of us got to go home only once a year .
for someone in that position it would be heartbreaking to have shorter summer holidays .
ray marsh , australia the voices of children in this discussion are conspicuously missing .
talking to my own and his friends today none of them want six terms and all prefer the longer holidays .
it seems that as we turn into adults we forget the fun times that summer holidays brought .
admittedly some may well not look back on the holidays as fun times depending on how they were treated at home but i am sure that like myself summer with six weeks of was heaven .
football in the street , down to the park with the gang , bit of fishing on the lake , it was free , visits to the museums , free again .
we all need a break including children .
remember , when we take our two weeks off for summer we are only just relaxing by the end of the second week when we have to return back to work .
leave the holidays alone .
jay tee , uk i can see various problems arising from this .
firstly , i do n't believe children will be able to learn effectively if they are stuck in a classroom throughout the summer .
secondly , i agree that more time would be wasted with the warm-up and cool-down periods .
finally , i believe that the long summer holidays are very important , in that they ensure that younger children are given a chance to play and be children , whilst older children can relieve the academic stress of the school year , and take the opportunity of gaining some experience in the world of paid work , therefore gaining more skills and learning to be responsible for their own spending money .
allison , scotland .
should n't there be proper consultation ?
sonia , england i do n't object to changing the school terms - however should n't there be proper consultation ? 2700 people took part in the initial survey , 60 % were in favour - 1620 people out of a population of approx 58 million - hardly representational of the majority is it ?
sonia , england no matter what the church may say , easter is awkward as far as the academic calendar goes !
personally , i think that a consistent and sensible education system for children is more important than preserving religious festivals !
why ca n't we make it into another bank holiday , then everyone has their way !
gareth t , wales the real problem is simply too many exams giles falconer , uk moving the exam season would certainly help those pupils who suffer from hayfever , but the real problem is simply too many exams .
as a teacher -lrb- and parent -rrb- , i would not mind these new proposals , or indeed any others providing they maintain the long summer break which is so vital to allow teachers both to enjoy a holiday and to prepare for the next year - which these days almost always brings new and different courses to teach !
as for the claim that pupils " get out of the learning habit " during these 5 to 6 weeks - it strangely seems not to affect our continental neighbours , many of whom enjoy an 8-week break !
giles falconer , uk i do n't know what the church is complaining about , after all easter is not the ' true ' easter .
it was moved during roman times by the catholic church from the time when the jews celebrate passover to adopt a pagan festival into the catholic religion .
6-week terms are far better and the summer holiday actually falls on what is normally the hottest part of the year .
andrew , bolton i think there should be a one-term school year - commencing 1 january and ending 31 december !
cavan duval , great britain the decision should be taken democratically adam j , uk the decision should be taken democratically .
if it 's what the people want it 's what the people should get .
the church plays no significant part in the majority of uk citizens ' lives so , they should not dictate on matters such as this .
interfering will only serve to marginalise the church and its views .
adam j , uk new south wales successfully moved from a 3 to a 4 term system a few years ago with the first term running from the end of january to easter .
terms are approximately 10 weeks long .
6 terms is too much .
there is always a period of warming up and easing off and too much time would be wasted .
leah , australia as a sufferer myself , i 'm all for avoiding exams during the hay fever season but the process of choosing universities starts way before then , around february .
also , if this means a shorter summer holiday , families with school-age children may be forced into more expensive holidays due to demand over a shorter period .
graham , essex , england i 'm 15 currently doing my gcses .
currently we are on study leave and i am really annoyed at trying to revise topics when it is very hot outside .
doing exams and revision earlier when the weather is cooler would help me concentrate a lot more .
andrew bullock , southend , uk i used to enjoy a 6 week holiday when i was at school ... millions of years ago .
the winter term did drag though , but it 's nicer to be out enjoying yourself in the summer rather than be in a classroom. of course kids these days do n't seem to like going out anyway ...
chris chow , uk the day i can vote for who runs the church is the day they have the right to speak on my or my children 's behalf .
my children do n't go to a church school , so if it makes life easier for them and their teachers , 6 terms it is !
bob , uk as far as i can tell what is proposed in england is the same as scotland has had for a large number of years fiona , scotland as far as i can tell what is proposed in england is the same as scotland has had for a large number of years , with an ' easter ' break set at the first 2 weeks of april .
if this is the case , then i ca n't see what the fuss is about , as the schools still teach about easter and its significance in the christian calendar .
there is also the added advantage that in england the bank holidays are taken so that children would have good friday and easter monday whenever easter falls and so there is not a problem .
fiona , scotland as a sixth form pupil i take exception to the idea of six terms instead of three .
the principal objections to this proposal are twofold - the loss of the ' summer holiday ' , and a query as to how much -lrb- if any -rrb- extra teaching time this will produce .
school pupils are still children , and as such should not be made to work for the whole of the time .
the long break of the summer holiday provides a clear gap between one academic year and the next , gives children a chance to relax , and removes them from the pressure cooker of school life for a reasonable interval .
two week holidays dotted throughout the year are not as satisfying as one long break .
making children sit in school during the height of the summer is far worse than a-levels at the start .
has anyone thought of the implications for the tourist trade ?
if the number of teaching days is to remain fixed , why bother re-arranging when they fall ?
thomas , northern ireland a number of schools - including a couple near here - have had success switching to five terms , because less time is wasted getting pupils back into learning-mode after long holidays .
but the six-term system is downright stupid , because it 's essentially the same as the current three term format , but with longer half-term holidays .
the debate should be about three terms or five .
michael , bristol , uk with the existing " half-term " system , there are already effectively six terms jon , uk with the existing " half-term " system , there are already effectively six terms , so why not formalise it and get rid of the anomalies of long and short half-terms , apart from no longer calling the coldest part of winter the " spring term " !
jon , uk in the summer , when most families use the light evenings to go out socially in the evening , surely if they have school the next day then this would not be as easy .
lorna willson , uk what 's the problem ?
jason , uk what 's the problem ?
no-one goes to church anyway these days .
the only downside will be those blissful half terms and long breaks when the trains are not quite at breaking point as parents are off with their kids .
jason , uk living in a tourist area , many businesses rely on student employment during the peak holiday times .
changing the school terms would put an end to this - unless someone is planning to change the weather at the same time !
shelley french , england i do n't really mind 3 or 6 terms as long as there is a proper holiday at easter , the main christian festival in a constitutionally christian country .
my 5 children and i have all loved the freedom of the long summer holidays and never got bored .
why do n't today 's children know how to entertain themselves ?
liz , suffolk , uk as long as people of all religions are allowed to take time out for holy days then a more balanced and reasonable schedule seems to be in order .
as for the churches ' claim that it undermines christianity , i think science , multiculturalism and their own foolish attitudes have done enough of that .
maybe they should wonder how the early church blossomed when not one of their festivals was recognised .
making them work for recognition and to spread the cause might make them a better faith .
martin bentley , uk the jewish schools find the easter break valuable too peter walke , uk there is another factor in the debate , in that easter , the most significant festival in the christian calendar , and passover , the jewish festival , are both at the same time of year , although they do not coincide exactly .
the jewish schools therefore find the easter break valuable too , and i am very aware of that , because i am a member of the anglican church in golders green , more known as a centre of jewish culture in north london .
i personally do not mind whether it is 3 or 6 terms , provided that at least the good friday holiday remained - it is a pity that the shops do not recognise the value of a quiet reflective day .
peter walke , uk the lga got the result that it paid for .
i have six children , five of whom are school age .
i see no reason to change .
shorter summer holidays would simply push up the cost of vacations and make life very difficult for employers as we all attempted to take the same fortnight .
six weeks is bad enough .
on second thoughts , just call each half term a term and thus satisfy all parties , including the irrelevant lga .
chris klein , england does it really matter ?
all i would be concerned about is whether there are adequate numbers of teachers of high enough quality to actually educate our children .
or are they all appearing on big brother ?
fraser , essex , england i presume that the public holidays of good friday and easter monday would be retained .
if so , i can not understand the religious objections .

or is this the change parents , children and teachers have been waiting for ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction what i would most like to see is the freedom for schools to decide when their holidays are .
that way there wo n't be holiday periods set in stone , and the travel industry would n't be able to rip us off with peak holiday season pricing .
iain friar , uk typically british !
spend more time and waste more money discussing such an issue as holidays instead of addressing the problems of low education standards , heavy bureaucracy and letting teachers teach .
bill , uk i just think that the long summer holiday should be kept because it is the ideal opportunity to go abroad , or on holiday generally .
i live in a multi-cultural city and because some people 's families live in other countries they need a long break to visit their families so the shortening of the holidays would mean that more time is taken off school because the family can not get back in time for the start of term .
elaine white , uk i believe it would be much better for both the students and teachers to retain the current system .
here , in the states , we have the two-week break for the christmas holiday and it goes by way too fast !
children need time to be children with time to play and have fun .
that is as much a part of learning as the formal education .
then , is when we learn many of our social skills and we learn a skill that many people take for granted ... to simply have fun !
life is not meant to be of only serious endeavours .
stephanie , usa the six term year is a great idea .
it would make much more sense to have all the terms of roughly equal length and holidays at roughly the same time .
also , in the current system , the september-october term is often 8 weeks , followed by just one week holiday ; the new system would give a much needed 2 week break in october .
easter is very awkward , because it causes the winter and summer terms to vary , but a simple solution to the church opposition would be to allow church of england schools to retain the present three term system , while other schools changed to the six term system .
e pack , london , uk i suffered horribly during my a-levels lizz , uk it does n't matter how many terms there are , what would be more sensible is to make sure exams are nowhere near the hay-fever season .
i suffered horribly during my a-levels , and not only is it impossible to do your best when you are suffering those symptoms , it is also very distracting for other people .
i see nothing wrong with a long break in the summer as such , just so long as they find some way of stopping the ridiculous system of forcing hay fever sufferers through exams when they are most ill .
even bringing them forward a month or two to april would mean that the worst of it had not set in , and it would be a bit more fair .
lizz , uk to the people complaining about the loss of the summer holiday - have you read the proposals ?
the 6 week summer holiday would remain , although it would move up slightly .
anyone wanting a longer summer holiday - by the end of 10 weeks , you 're sick of it , and you have forgotten half of the past year 's material !
alexis , usa as a pupil , i feel it would help the way we work to have more holidays , more often but for less time .
at the moment the break between the summer and autumn is far too long and i feel we lose previous knowledge , which it then takes teachers two weeks to remind us of .
this is especially true in the gcse course .
susie , uk i would object strongly to changing the present system jenny coppen , uk i would object strongly to changing the present system .
chopping school life into small pieces would be too unsettling for all concerned .
there would be no appreciation of holidays as they would be finished before they started .
too much time would be spent settling in at the beginning and relaxing at the end of each term .
there would be no time for enjoying the long summer holiday and no time for the more social events in term time , when staff and pupils go on adventure weeks or similar such activities .
for many children this can be their first , or indeed only , chance to socialise with others under these circumstances .
all my children have received tremendous benefit from such things .
jenny coppen , uk there is in my opinion a strong argument for a change to the six term format .
i believe that the attention span of children is more compatible with six shorter terms than three longer terms .
it might lead to more information being retained and would allow teachers to spot those pupils who are struggling and give them assistance before they fall too far behind .
it would also reduce the amount of time over the summer when children are left to their own devices , potentially leading to less juvenile delinquency .
it would also make life for parents easier as it would give them wider options as to when they should take family holidays .
mathew rowlands , uk why does the church have to interfere with education in a multi-cultural and multi-religion society ?
the religious aspects of holidays has already been lost .
most people use the time to relax with family , rather than go to church .
s. sahai , uk why spend money on changing the year when there are more important educational needs ?
andy , uk " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " .
the school year may have imperfections , but then so did the rates , and look at the chaos when the poll tax came into being .
this change would cost money - why spend money on changing the year when there are more important educational needs ?
some have mentioned that old truism about hay fever suffering .
hay fever is awful - i suffer from it - but it rarely stops people sitting exams .
holidays - shorter ones with different peak times will mean less well off parents removing their kids from school more frequently to get cheaper off-peak holidays .
anyway , i want my kids to be able to play outdoors in sunny weather .
they 're tested to distraction already , and depriving them of sunlight to " facilitate " exams is madness .
the lga should step back a bit , and get a sense of perspective .
andy , uk i 'm a working parent who takes unpaid leave to cover the summer holidays .
both my children and myself enjoy them and , rather than reduce them , we would like them to be extended to eight weeks -lrb- all of july and august -rrb- .
caron , england a good idea , but the terms should be staggered by a week or two region by region to even out demand for holidays , both in the uk and abroad .
fred , uk all i can say is , that when i was a kid , i 'd have hated the idea of someone depriving me of my six week summer holiday !
jim anderson , uk thank goodness - escaping from the ludicrous three-term system has become a serious proposal at last !
it makes no sense whatsoever to anybody , least of all those giving or receiving education , to have long terms followed by interminable holidays .
spacing terms properly will undoubtedly produce better results and happier students , teachers and parents .
andy millward , uk i was among thousands of students who had homes overseas but went to school in uk .
some of us got to go home only once a year .
for someone in that position it would be heartbreaking to have shorter summer holidays .
ray marsh , australia the voices of children in this discussion are conspicuously missing .
talking to my own and his friends today none of them want six terms and all prefer the longer holidays .
it seems that as we turn into adults we forget the fun times that summer holidays brought .
admittedly some may well not look back on the holidays as fun times depending on how they were treated at home but i am sure that like myself summer with six weeks of was heaven .
football in the street , down to the park with the gang , bit of fishing on the lake , it was free , visits to the museums , free again .
we all need a break including children .
remember , when we take our two weeks off for summer we are only just relaxing by the end of the second week when we have to return back to work .
leave the holidays alone .
jay tee , uk i can see various problems arising from this .
firstly , i do n't believe children will be able to learn effectively if they are stuck in a classroom throughout the summer .
secondly , i agree that more time would be wasted with the warm-up and cool-down periods .
finally , i believe that the long summer holidays are very important , in that they ensure that younger children are given a chance to play and be children , whilst older children can relieve the academic stress of the school year , and take the opportunity of gaining some experience in the world of paid work , therefore gaining more skills and learning to be responsible for their own spending money .
allison , scotland .
should n't there be proper consultation ?
sonia , england i do n't object to changing the school terms - however should n't there be proper consultation ? 2700 people took part in the initial survey , 60 % were in favour - 1620 people out of a population of approx 58 million - hardly representational of the majority is it ?
sonia , england no matter what the church may say , easter is awkward as far as the academic calendar goes !
personally , i think that a consistent and sensible education system for children is more important than preserving religious festivals !
why ca n't we make it into another bank holiday , then everyone has their way !
gareth t , wales the real problem is simply too many exams giles falconer , uk moving the exam season would certainly help those pupils who suffer from hayfever , but the real problem is simply too many exams .
as a teacher -lrb- and parent -rrb- , i would not mind these new proposals , or indeed any others providing they maintain the long summer break which is so vital to allow teachers both to enjoy a holiday and to prepare for the next year - which these days almost always brings new and different courses to teach !
as for the claim that pupils " get out of the learning habit " during these 5 to 6 weeks - it strangely seems not to affect our continental neighbours , many of whom enjoy an 8-week break !
giles falconer , uk i do n't know what the church is complaining about , after all easter is not the ' true ' easter .
it was moved during roman times by the catholic church from the time when the jews celebrate passover to adopt a pagan festival into the catholic religion .
6-week terms are far better and the summer holiday actually falls on what is normally the hottest part of the year .
andrew , bolton i think there should be a one-term school year - commencing 1 january and ending 31 december !
cavan duval , great britain the decision should be taken democratically adam j , uk the decision should be taken democratically .
if it 's what the people want it 's what the people should get .
the church plays no significant part in the majority of uk citizens ' lives so , they should not dictate on matters such as this .
interfering will only serve to marginalise the church and its views .
adam j , uk new south wales successfully moved from a 3 to a 4 term system a few years ago with the first term running from the end of january to easter .
terms are approximately 10 weeks long .
6 terms is too much .
there is always a period of warming up and easing off and too much time would be wasted .
leah , australia as a sufferer myself , i 'm all for avoiding exams during the hay fever season but the process of choosing universities starts way before then , around february .
also , if this means a shorter summer holiday , families with school-age children may be forced into more expensive holidays due to demand over a shorter period .
graham , essex , england i 'm 15 currently doing my gcses .
currently we are on study leave and i am really annoyed at trying to revise topics when it is very hot outside .
doing exams and revision earlier when the weather is cooler would help me concentrate a lot more .
andrew bullock , southend , uk i used to enjoy a 6 week holiday when i was at school ... millions of years ago .
the winter term did drag though , but it 's nicer to be out enjoying yourself in the summer rather than be in a classroom. of course kids these days do n't seem to like going out anyway ...
chris chow , uk the day i can vote for who runs the church is the day they have the right to speak on my or my children 's behalf .
my children do n't go to a church school , so if it makes life easier for them and their teachers , 6 terms it is !
bob , uk as far as i can tell what is proposed in england is the same as scotland has had for a large number of years fiona , scotland as far as i can tell what is proposed in england is the same as scotland has had for a large number of years , with an ' easter ' break set at the first 2 weeks of april .
if this is the case , then i ca n't see what the fuss is about , as the schools still teach about easter and its significance in the christian calendar .
there is also the added advantage that in england the bank holidays are taken so that children would have good friday and easter monday whenever easter falls and so there is not a problem .
fiona , scotland as a sixth form pupil i take exception to the idea of six terms instead of three .
the principal objections to this proposal are twofold - the loss of the ' summer holiday ' , and a query as to how much -lrb- if any -rrb- extra teaching time this will produce .
school pupils are still children , and as such should not be made to work for the whole of the time .
the long break of the summer holiday provides a clear gap between one academic year and the next , gives children a chance to relax , and removes them from the pressure cooker of school life for a reasonable interval .
two week holidays dotted throughout the year are not as satisfying as one long break .
making children sit in school during the height of the summer is far worse than a-levels at the start .
has anyone thought of the implications for the tourist trade ?
if the number of teaching days is to remain fixed , why bother re-arranging when they fall ?
thomas , northern ireland a number of schools - including a couple near here - have had success switching to five terms , because less time is wasted getting pupils back into learning-mode after long holidays .
but the six-term system is downright stupid , because it 's essentially the same as the current three term format , but with longer half-term holidays .
the debate should be about three terms or five .
michael , bristol , uk with the existing " half-term " system , there are already effectively six terms jon , uk with the existing " half-term " system , there are already effectively six terms , so why not formalise it and get rid of the anomalies of long and short half-terms , apart from no longer calling the coldest part of winter the " spring term " !
jon , uk in the summer , when most families use the light evenings to go out socially in the evening , surely if they have school the next day then this would not be as easy .
lorna willson , uk what 's the problem ?
jason , uk what 's the problem ?
no-one goes to church anyway these days .
the only downside will be those blissful half terms and long breaks when the trains are not quite at breaking point as parents are off with their kids .
jason , uk living in a tourist area , many businesses rely on student employment during the peak holiday times .
changing the school terms would put an end to this - unless someone is planning to change the weather at the same time !
shelley french , england i do n't really mind 3 or 6 terms as long as there is a proper holiday at easter , the main christian festival in a constitutionally christian country .
my 5 children and i have all loved the freedom of the long summer holidays and never got bored .
why do n't today 's children know how to entertain themselves ?
liz , suffolk , uk as long as people of all religions are allowed to take time out for holy days then a more balanced and reasonable schedule seems to be in order .
as for the churches ' claim that it undermines christianity , i think science , multiculturalism and their own foolish attitudes have done enough of that .
maybe they should wonder how the early church blossomed when not one of their festivals was recognised .
making them work for recognition and to spread the cause might make them a better faith .
martin bentley , uk the jewish schools find the easter break valuable too peter walke , uk there is another factor in the debate , in that easter , the most significant festival in the christian calendar , and passover , the jewish festival , are both at the same time of year , although they do not coincide exactly .
the jewish schools therefore find the easter break valuable too , and i am very aware of that , because i am a member of the anglican church in golders green , more known as a centre of jewish culture in north london .
i personally do not mind whether it is 3 or 6 terms , provided that at least the good friday holiday remained - it is a pity that the shops do not recognise the value of a quiet reflective day .
peter walke , uk the lga got the result that it paid for .
i have six children , five of whom are school age .
i see no reason to change .
shorter summer holidays would simply push up the cost of vacations and make life very difficult for employers as we all attempted to take the same fortnight .
six weeks is bad enough .
on second thoughts , just call each half term a term and thus satisfy all parties , including the irrelevant lga .
chris klein , england does it really matter ?
all i would be concerned about is whether there are adequate numbers of teachers of high enough quality to actually educate our children .
or are they all appearing on big brother ?
fraser , essex , england i presume that the public holidays of good friday and easter monday would be retained .
if so , i can not understand the religious objections .

a new sculpture has been unveiled for the empty plinth in london 's trafalgar square .
rachel whiteread 's monument is a water-clear resin cast of the inside of the granite plinth itself .
whiteread first captured the public imagination with her life-sized cement cast of the inside of a terraced three-storey house in east london in 1993 .
patrick elliott , of scotland 's national gallery of modern art , predicts it will be a triumph .
but what do you think ?
is it the right thing for trafalgar square ?
will the plinth be a success ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i have seen all the empty plinth sculptures .
the figure of christ was a bit lost and tiny and rather twee ; i loved the gothic tree just for its oddness but ms whiteread 's sculpture is easily the best of them all .
brilliant and strangely calming .
queenie hobbs , brixton , uk tomorrow people will shake their heads and despair at tomorrow 's art luke , uk tomorrow people will shake their heads and despair at tomorrow 's art , whilst fondly recalling the art of today .
exactly the way many people wish art now was the way it was yesterday .
luke , uk ok - as long as it gets recycled in a week 's time .
sid , uk ace , man , now we have somewhere to enjoy our leftover pizza where snotty kids ca n't chase us .
the pigeons , trafalgar square it 's not going to be there for long .
it 's a bit of fun by someone who has only one idea in art .
snigger a bit , and let it pass .
bob harvey , lincolnshire , uk i think it 's absolutely beautiful paul mcmichael , london , uk i think it 's absolutely beautiful - serene , even a little melancholic .. the subtle change of colour at certain angles in a certain light ..
i do n't care if that was not what the artist intended .
shame it is temporary and is being shipped elsewhere .
this is the best of the three pieces so far commissioned for the plinth and , now we have the habit , i do hope we can continue ... after all , we 're all talking about it are n't we ?
and people who feel strongly that it should be some military hero , should do something about it .
but do n't expect anything conventional from the most popular british artists .
paul mcmichael , london , uk how sad .
anti history has reached new depths .
modern art has its place but nelson 's column is not it .
why not a statue to honour those who gave their lives so that pretentious people can look at it , and pontificate about their unimaginative plinth statues .
but let them look at them elsewhere than trafalgar square .
mark rees , usa an utterly astonishing piece of artistic tripe dominic , uk an utterly astonishing piece of artistic tripe .
it eschews a point so shallow and blatant as to be unworthy of a place in someone 's back yard , yet alone the heart of our nation 's capital .
at least a statue of david beckham would capture some essence of the times in which we live .
dominic , uk i 'm bewildered that many of the comments here are about how the plinth should be used for " other " sculptures , and that people do n't know that ms whiteread 's sculpture is only temporary .
do n't they know that only a few months ago a tree was on the plinth , and before that , a statue of jesus christ ?
forget about your knowledge of art , people , your knowledge of current affairs leaves a lot to be desired !
l porter , uk it is only right to give this piece its chance bill , coventry , uk given that the result of the lengthy investigation into the future of the empty plinth was that it would be home to a variety of sculpture , it is only right to give this piece its chance .
but can we hope that one of the future works to be displayed for a period will be something more like the other traditional statuary , so that for a while londoners and visitors can see the square balanced at last ?
bill , coventry , uk utterly ridiculous .
put a war hero there that people can respect for centuries , not an obscure piece of modern art .
gavin pearson , detroit , mi , usa it 's so much better than the imperial statues of military generals dave whyte , uk it is a refreshing change to have some unusual sculptures occupying the empty plinth in trafalgar square .
it 's so much better than the imperial statues of military generals that seem to infest london .
dave whyte , uk i shudder with the prospect that modernism has come to this hallowed area of london .
surely a grand venue deserves a grand statue .
i ask you - a plinth ?
symbols of our age are deserving , along with mandela , mother teresa , and heroes of the current day .
surely we can do better than a plinth ?
what a cop out !
jonathan chapman , uk i remember all the fuss when the glass pyramid was unveiled at the louvre in paris - it was a desecration of a traditional building etc. etc .
now it has become a paris landmark just like the eiffel tower -lrb- which was also vilified in its day -rrb- .
let 's have some vision in the appreciation of modern works of art and less of the luddite attitudes expressed here .
derek , u.k. i think it 's an absolutely brilliant piece nuha ansari , usa i think it 's an absolutely brilliant piece , at a time when so much new british art is pretty hit-or-miss .
trafalgar square certainly does n't need yet another boring imperialist .
nuha ansari , usa rachel whiteread could n't have shown less imagination and skill if she had tried .
this kind of " emperor 's new clothes " statement has been made dozens of times before and was never clever or insightful .
whiteread is quite obviously having a laugh at the expense of those who commissioned her , and she has deprived the square of the fruits of genuine talent .
paul tyrrell , uk it offers plenty of graffiti space for those so inclined s sahai , uk it seems typical of " new britain " to desecrate a world popular monument by installing a piece of modern art -lrb- ? -rrb- .
never mind that it does not fit into the ambiance of trafalgar square , never mind that it has no historic significance whatsoever , and never mind that most tourists will just laugh at it .
even if people think of this as a work of art , there are better places in london to install it than at trafalgar square .
on the plus side , it offers plenty of graffiti space for those so inclined , and perhaps they will shall now leave the other statues in the square alone .
s sahai , uk the nation 's fourth plinth at trafalgar square should be devoted to the country 's finest hour in modern times - the battle of britain .
a statue of an raf pilot should therefore grace it .
adrian m shryane , united kingdom i like the work but it is not appropriate for the location .
the statuary in the square depicts those who have battled for britain over the centuries -lrb- for good or ill -rrb- .
if a non-militaristic subject is required who better than alan turing who through his work with others at bletchley park invented one of the first computers , decoded the nazi codes and arguably swung the balance against hitler 's war machine .
that he was subsequently persecuted to the point of suicide by the british establishment is something to be atoned for .
antony , uk since the square is dedicated to the battle of trafalgar , and since admiral nelson is honoured with a column , it is only right that admiral collingwood , nelson 's second in command and the man who actually won the battle after nelson made his excuses and left -lrb- okay died -rrb- , is also honoured .
johnny , newcastle uk what 's all the fuss about ?
rachel whiteread obviously has a sense of humour and the " culture minister " took it seriously .
paul , gloucester , england no doubt the usual luddites will come crawling out of the woodwork complaining about " modern art " .
it is a refreshing change to have some unusual sculptures occupying the empty plinth in trafalgar square .
it 's so much better than the imperial statues of military generals that seem to infest london .
dave whyte , uk if there must be a statue , let it be darwin .
let 's celebrate one of the greatest british scientists in history rather than yet another military man or politician .
tom k , uk as one commentator observed , " art is passionate , thought out and inspiring " .
it 's even easier than that - art is whatever it wants to be .
if this is a result of an effort not to offend anyone , then how come it seems to have offended so many ?
i like it - it 's drawn attention to the fact that nobody cared that there was nothing on the block until now !
jonathan barrett , scotland i read in the paper today that " it " is not here to stay , but will be sold off in a few months , thank goodness for that .
the sooner the better .
as it is trafalgar square , has no one got the skills to erect a model of hms victory to put on the plinth ?
colin mackay , uk it reflects exactly the depths this politically correct country has fallen to peter , uk it reflects exactly the depths this politically correct country has fallen to that there is not a hero or statesman in modern times worth putting on a plinth .
we are dead as a nation and this just consolidates the point .
peter , uk incredible that rachel whiteread - an " artist " who i , at least , have never heard of making anything other than casts of things - should come to the conclusion that the most appropriate sculpture for this plinth should be ... a cast !
lucky for her , really - if anything else had been more appropriate , she 'd have been out of the running .
mark rendle , uk hold on !
a sculpture of an empty plinth ?
let 's have a competition to see who can design a sculpture to sit on it ! !
al , uk ok , so some may not consider it art .
so what ?
mat , united kingdom ok , so some may not consider it art .
so what ?
trafalgar square is , ultimately , a very dull place .
why not brighten it up ?
if ninety percent of the people that see it think , " hmm , that 's a bit odd , i do n't like that much ! " then at least they 've noticed it and taken the time to form an opinion .
how often does anybody actually stop and consider any of the other works on display there , i wonder ?
mat , united kingdom in the year 2001 i would think a huge , black , humming monolith would be an appropriate choice .
essada , uk stop trying to foist your limited aesthetic judgement on the rest of us toby , uk it is disappointing to read that so many people have such a narrow view of art and fail to see their comments in the context of history .
many seem to think of " art " as merely representation or illustration - this constitutes only a small part of the " art " spectrum and other , more stimulating , work should be given a fair airing .
those who decry modern art today are the same people who piously condemned other past masters , such as monet , in their day .
to them : stop trying to foist your limited aesthetic judgement on the rest of us , we have enough of your dry , repetitive , insipid dross surrounding us already !
toby , uk to michael uk .
being a member of the " vast majority of the public -lsb- who -rsb- do n't understand a sculpture " , i was rather hoping you could explain what it all means it to me .
after all i 'm a reasonably intelligent person with a degree , i can speak several languages and play the piano but somehow i just do n't get it .
to me it just looks like a clear reflection of a plinth .
what does this mean ?
how can our reaction to a transparent box tell us anything of value about ourselves ?
perhaps it humorous ; what do you put on a plinth that has been empty for so long ?
a plinth .
i 'm hardly overcome with mirth .
or is it perhaps the case that something so mundane and irrelevant has no meaning in itself ?
if i look at a traditional sculpture at least i understand something of the relationship between artist and subject and something of the world and politics of the time .
this is just a boring idea which says nothing .
now i would concede that perhaps i 'm not sophisticated enough to understand this work .
but the problem with that is that i not convinced by anybody who claims they are .
we are always being told that this or that something is " important " , has " resonance " , " meaning " but no one can tell you exactly why these things are true .
and in my view the reason for this is that it is just fashion , not art .
graham , uk reading these responses is so depressing - it 's art !
it 's meant to make you become aware , or feel , or be angry or just think something .
it does n't have to be any good , and you do n't have to like it - but so many people saying what a waste of money it is and that they 'd rather have a statue of some bigoted xenophobe from the national military history ?
these are the same people who 've made big brother the focal point of culture in this country .
it 's a sad comment on all of us .
bob trivers , uk i adore modern art , and this new fourth plinth is brilliant , but in the wrong place , in trafalgar square , we should have our history , there are much nicer places to put modern art on display in london , and i think the idea that the fourth plinth should have anything on at all just goes to show , how much our politicians -lrb- including london 's mayor -rrb- are trying to wipe out our past .
angela , gb right !
that 's it .
i 'm moving overseas .
goodbye sweet britain .
i 'll come back as soon as you are feeling better .
be good ...
ha , london , uk art is supposed to stimulate the senses , provoking emotion such as love , hate , calm , etc .
this waste of space has been thought up by some " clever " artist who is spending too much time contemplating her own navel and not enough time actually creating something that is exciting and relevant .
the only emotion that this old idea will stir in me is nausea .
daniel james , london , uk i think it 'll be great !
it 's modern , quirky and clever !
i think we may tire of it after some time , but that 's why there 's to be a rotating selection .
public art is always tricky as it needs to be challenging , different from the accepted norms to be noticed , and yet relevant at the same time .
i say well done to the artists and also to the selectors for making a difficult choice without taking themselves too seriously .
richard , uk the plinth is cute but i think a serious work would be better as nothing ages quite so fast as a joke .
this is what you call re-inventing the wheel .
look at something , think that it would be a great idea to copy it and call it " art " , then get all the luvvies drooling about how stunning it is .
next thing you know , someone will copy a bus stop and make 50 grand out of it .
here , wait a . sorry , got to go now . i feel an inspiration coming on !
joe , uk i 'd also be keen on a statue of mandela looking over towards the south african embassy on the east side of the square .
i find it sad that many commentors are using their own ignorance of history as a reason to put an abstract work on the site .
presumably these people would turn the british library over to collecting dvd 's on the grounds that most people have n't read all the books it contains now .
thomas worthington , uk there is a place for modern art , however trafalgar square is not it .
either leave it empty or commission a statue in keeping with the rest of the square .
caron , england why ca n't there be statues of british people who have done something worthwhile for mankind ian , england whitehall is full of statues celebrating war .
why ca n't there be statues of british people who have done something worthwhile for mankind eg edward jenner -lrb- vaccination -rrb- ?
ian , england i 'm sure rachel is very talented .
but this sculpture is most inappropriate for this plinth .
it is not in keeping with its surroundings or neighbours .
it should be used for a special statesman / woman - or even the queen mother .
david warburton , uk the plinth is an excellent showcase for sculpture .
some have been excellent , some not so good , but at least new art is getting a very public airing .
it does not matter whether whiteread 's work is on its own , only that we keep getting interesting pieces shown up there .
much rather that than a permanent stuffed shirt or worthy .
and i am what you might call a " force of conservatism " ...
james mcrae , uk i believe nelson mandela should be up there immortalised in stone kirk , uk there are more worthy sculptures that should go up .
for example , captain cook who - apart from being an understudy of nelson - discovered most of the southern part of the pacific .
personally , i believe nelson mandela should be up there immortalised in stone .
kirk , uk the " plinth " looks far more exciting than any of the suggestions and other temporary exhibits seen so far .
a statue of a person can only be ephemeral , as the one on the other plinth shows ; who is it , and does anybody remember him ?
if the plinth were always guaranteed to be clear and sparkling , perhaps made out of solid glass , it would raise a smile for generations to come , without ever raising a question mark .
dave swindell , england if we are told it is a success , it will be a success .
if the media treat it like the millennium dome , it will fail .
why something so boring would be popular escapes me .
personally i would n't touch what passes for ' art ' at present with a ten-foot pole - either because it 's a rotting cow or it is n't there .
over the ages past art was usually the result of the search for beauty and represented those things which mattered to us the most .
its present state can only be explained by us thinking we already found those things and need to move on or that they are n't there to be found .
it is a sad thing if either is true .
natalia n , uk i do not see this pulling the crowds chris klein , england i do not see this pulling the crowds .
however , i am full of admiration for people who have the audacity to call this art and to demand and receive payment for their efforts .
chris klein , england what a waste of money .
surely they could have spent the money on something better like a poster propaganda campaign or something .
alan perry , great britain so the new ' statue ' is going to be a large plastic box .
as an indicator of today 's disposable society , i suppose it makes sense .
boring , but appropriate .
however , the big question has to be - who 's going to keep cleaning it once the pigeons have - ahem - christened it ? !
kevin , london , uk my god !
and someone 's getting paid for this ? ? ! ! !
sam , uk it 's just an architectural feature - not art .
very dull .
wayne , england next time , give me a call and i 'll ask my wee one to knock something up from some lego .
doug , the netherlands the plinth will soon be vandalised and blackened with grime emily burton , uk give it time - you 'll see that just like everything else in our tarnished capital , the plinth will soon be vandalised and blackened with grime .
given a few months , i 'm fairly certain that it will reflect nothing more than the naive hopes of a nation desperately trying to forget who we are and where we 've come from .
emily burton , uk oh dear , oh dear , oh dear .
mike , australia this is an inspiring work of art , it shows the struggle of the great british nation against oppressive invaders , it displays the glory of the mighty royal navy , and finally , it promises us a magnificent future of an ultramodern , hip , young great britain !
edwin , usa , formerly uk it is a witty piece that is meant to disorientate - and to delight !
chand , united states this makes us re-think our ideas about the place .
how many times have you taken a bus ride through the square and thought about what it celebrates - the naval victory , nearly 200 years ago now , of one nascent empire over another .
the reaction this sculpture brings is a measure of how much and how little britain has changed in the ensuing centuries .
it is a witty piece that is meant to disorientate - and to delight !
it stands in contrast to the somber pomposity of the bronzed generals that surround it .
literally , it turns things on their head .
two hundred years from now rachel whiteread will be noted as an inventive , forthright and arresting sculptor - long after the ideas of great britain as a seafaring empire have dimmed .
chand , united states in 10 or 20 years you 're going to realise what happened to britain , and this " statue " is going to describe the political correctness that is behind everything .
peter b , usa -lrb- ex - uk -rrb- people judge this monument too much on aesthetic purposes .
i think using trafalgar square to promote contemporary art is a brilliant idea .
even though many may not like it , it at least opens an avenue to the arts in britain where most contemporary art is misrepresented in the media .
john ngo , uk the notion that art should be about passions and emotions is a fine demonstration of why the public at large should have no say about what goes on the fourth plinth in trafalgar square .
this idea was boring and staid in the nineteenth century !
the last thing we need is more jingoistic rubbish like the other statues , and second-last is a romantic revival !
patrick , uk even rembrandt was thought to be sensationally radical when he first painted michael , uk with due respects to the traditionalists who have written in , they should remember that even rembrandt was thought to be sensationally radical when he first painted .
just because the vast majority of the public do n't understand a sculpture does n't mean it is n't great sculpture .
i fully support the scheme for the fourth plinth , and would like to add that the notion of putting up a statue of william iv now would be a horrific backward step .
the statues that were put on the first three plinths were hardly exciting in their time , and it would be an unimaginable shame to make another one like them when we could do something imaginative .
michael , uk like some other commentators i like whiteread 's work but i do n't think her plinth is the best idea for trafalgar square .
her " house " was superb as a way of expressing how we normally overlook the spaces that surround things in deference to the things themselves , and her holocaust memorial -lrb- a cast of a library -rrb- is excellent .
my vote would go to " ecce homo " which was the life-size statue of jesus christ as a normal , vulnerable man by -lrb- i think -rrb- mark wallinger .
it fits with the other plinths in that they have minor and major historical figures on them , but it subverts the idea of overblown oversized monuments .
alan simpson , uk this is 2001 .
how about a black monolith ?
tom , bristol i can just hear all those pigeons cheering !
sj , us sarah justesen , united states no matter what you try to do , art always reflects the people who created it .
in years to come , this piece of art will identify us as a people who could n't think of anything .
jon livesey , usa it gets people talking if nothing else jim , uk just as the london eye and tate modern are symbols of a healthy and creative country , so the " plinth on a plinth " dares to be original and modern .
this is a good thing .
it gets people talking if nothing else .
jim , uk an appropriate observation on the present state of the nation .
vacant and devoid of innovation aaron daly , canada dull , unimaginative , uninspiring , thoughtless pap .
a true testament to modern british culture .
tom , uk as the square is about the military bravery that made britain great , and the plinth is directly infront of the canadian embassy , i think the statue should have represented the canadians that helped us all during ww2 dave mison , usa while the sculpture has some good points , it will not be in keeping with the others in trafalgar square .
the ideal sculpture for the plinth would have been ' britannia ' a symbol for the whole of the country .
dave , uk ' art ' just continues to joke itself into oblivion andrew denny , uk ' art ' just continues to joke itself into oblivion .
we 've had an empty plinth quite happily for 150 years , and the fact that it 's empty is now part of the look of the square .
why the urge to put something on it ?
if it moves , salute it .
if it does n't move ... well , just leave it alone !
or at least put a traditional colonial statue there - at least it 'll be in character .
andrew denny , uk i like whiteread 's work , but not for trafalgar square .
the only fitting sculpture so far was the jesus figure .
i clark , england what about a statue representing all the people who are bored with politics and are unlikely to vote !
michael dupree , united kingdom this piece of work would probably look great in the newly developed areas of canary wharf etc .
but not in trafalgar square , what about a statue representing all the people who are bored with politics and are unlikely to vote !
michael dupree , united kingdom first we had a piece of blu-tack shortlisted for the turner prize , now a plinth on a plinth for trafalgar square - whatever next ?
ca n't we gather all these people in one place and leave them to amuse each other .
nick , uk now it is clear that william iv should sit astride the plinth , but for the sum of money he fail to bequeath on his death .
the money should be found to erect the intended statue to complete the masterpiece that trafalgar square was designed to be .
these funds are to come from the remaining budget for erecting a lasting monument or the lottery funds , heritage section .
at least this will prevent any re-invention of our history by future generations .
paul higbee , england am i right in thinking that nelson and trafalgar square are a celebration of the military bravery which helped make britain great ?
once again it appears that our history as a nation of brave men is to be subjected to political correctness in order not to offend anyone .
james , england " hey guys , i 've got an idea , let 's put a plinth on the plinth ! "
martin , uk full marks for the idea , which is original , but to me it looks comical .
if that is the effect , then it has worked .
if not ... well , it 's one of those good ideas you get in the pub at 10:30 just before the last pint and giggle about for the next thirty minutes .
" hey guys , i 've got an idea , let 's put a plinth on the plinth ! "
probably best left as an idea than realised , but still , it 's more interesting than a stuffy old statue of some dull old statesman or a boring old monarch wielding his monocle .
martin , uk if the ' purpose ' of public art is to stimulate the minds of the public and provide a focus for personal reflection and discussion , no doubt any piece of art placed bang in the middle of one of london 's most prominent public spaces would cause controversy - too conservative for some , too drastic for others .
therefore the plinth has already fulfilled it 's ' function ' .
as for the plinth being popular , whether you like an object or not is a matter of personal taste ; beauty is always in the eye of the beholder .
i reserve judgement until i 've seen it for real myself .
heather , manchester , uk i understand what the artist is trying to do / say with her proposal however it will lose its gloss very quickly with the amount bird mess that will decorate it .
i know what it does to my car so a clear block will soon become rather unclear !
andy girvan , scotland art is passionate , thought out and inspiring emmett brady , uk evidently , this is the kind of rubbish tom stoppard was talking about when he addressed the royal academy .
out of all of the things you could put on a plinth , you choose a mould of itself ?
and that 's art ! ?
art is passionate , thought out and inspiring .
this was obviously doodled on the back of a napkin in 5 minutes by someone with less skills than a builder ...
emmett brady , manchester , uk i revel in this triumph ' the progressive ' movement for decent art .
not only is this piece practical but also it 's satisfying the aesthetic standards of ' our day ' .
nice .
robert tripe , england i walked past the still covered sculpture on saturday night .
i think it is going to fit in very well with it 's surroundings .
the sculpture is both innovative and unobtrusive , and it 's a far cry from the old colonial statues that usually occupy plinths like that .

a new sculpture has been unveiled for the empty plinth in london 's trafalgar square .
rachel whiteread 's monument is a water-clear resin cast of the inside of the granite plinth itself .
whiteread first captured the public imagination with her life-sized cement cast of the inside of a terraced three-storey house in east london in 1993 .
patrick elliott , of scotland 's national gallery of modern art , predicts it will be a triumph .
but what do you think ?
is it the right thing for trafalgar square ?
will the plinth be a success ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i have seen all the empty plinth sculptures .
the figure of christ was a bit lost and tiny and rather twee ; i loved the gothic tree just for its oddness but ms whiteread 's sculpture is easily the best of them all .
brilliant and strangely calming .
queenie hobbs , brixton , uk tomorrow people will shake their heads and despair at tomorrow 's art luke , uk tomorrow people will shake their heads and despair at tomorrow 's art , whilst fondly recalling the art of today .
exactly the way many people wish art now was the way it was yesterday .
luke , uk ok - as long as it gets recycled in a week 's time .
sid , uk ace , man , now we have somewhere to enjoy our leftover pizza where snotty kids ca n't chase us .
the pigeons , trafalgar square it 's not going to be there for long .
it 's a bit of fun by someone who has only one idea in art .
snigger a bit , and let it pass .
bob harvey , lincolnshire , uk i think it 's absolutely beautiful paul mcmichael , london , uk i think it 's absolutely beautiful - serene , even a little melancholic .. the subtle change of colour at certain angles in a certain light ..
i do n't care if that was not what the artist intended .
shame it is temporary and is being shipped elsewhere .
this is the best of the three pieces so far commissioned for the plinth and , now we have the habit , i do hope we can continue ... after all , we 're all talking about it are n't we ?
and people who feel strongly that it should be some military hero , should do something about it .
but do n't expect anything conventional from the most popular british artists .
paul mcmichael , london , uk how sad .
anti history has reached new depths .
modern art has its place but nelson 's column is not it .
why not a statue to honour those who gave their lives so that pretentious people can look at it , and pontificate about their unimaginative plinth statues .
but let them look at them elsewhere than trafalgar square .
mark rees , usa an utterly astonishing piece of artistic tripe dominic , uk an utterly astonishing piece of artistic tripe .
it eschews a point so shallow and blatant as to be unworthy of a place in someone 's back yard , yet alone the heart of our nation 's capital .
at least a statue of david beckham would capture some essence of the times in which we live .
dominic , uk i 'm bewildered that many of the comments here are about how the plinth should be used for " other " sculptures , and that people do n't know that ms whiteread 's sculpture is only temporary .
do n't they know that only a few months ago a tree was on the plinth , and before that , a statue of jesus christ ?
forget about your knowledge of art , people , your knowledge of current affairs leaves a lot to be desired !
l porter , uk it is only right to give this piece its chance bill , coventry , uk given that the result of the lengthy investigation into the future of the empty plinth was that it would be home to a variety of sculpture , it is only right to give this piece its chance .
but can we hope that one of the future works to be displayed for a period will be something more like the other traditional statuary , so that for a while londoners and visitors can see the square balanced at last ?
bill , coventry , uk utterly ridiculous .
put a war hero there that people can respect for centuries , not an obscure piece of modern art .
gavin pearson , detroit , mi , usa it 's so much better than the imperial statues of military generals dave whyte , uk it is a refreshing change to have some unusual sculptures occupying the empty plinth in trafalgar square .
it 's so much better than the imperial statues of military generals that seem to infest london .
dave whyte , uk i shudder with the prospect that modernism has come to this hallowed area of london .
surely a grand venue deserves a grand statue .
i ask you - a plinth ?
symbols of our age are deserving , along with mandela , mother teresa , and heroes of the current day .
surely we can do better than a plinth ?
what a cop out !
jonathan chapman , uk i remember all the fuss when the glass pyramid was unveiled at the louvre in paris - it was a desecration of a traditional building etc. etc .
now it has become a paris landmark just like the eiffel tower -lrb- which was also vilified in its day -rrb- .
let 's have some vision in the appreciation of modern works of art and less of the luddite attitudes expressed here .
derek , u.k. i think it 's an absolutely brilliant piece nuha ansari , usa i think it 's an absolutely brilliant piece , at a time when so much new british art is pretty hit-or-miss .
trafalgar square certainly does n't need yet another boring imperialist .
nuha ansari , usa rachel whiteread could n't have shown less imagination and skill if she had tried .
this kind of " emperor 's new clothes " statement has been made dozens of times before and was never clever or insightful .
whiteread is quite obviously having a laugh at the expense of those who commissioned her , and she has deprived the square of the fruits of genuine talent .
paul tyrrell , uk it offers plenty of graffiti space for those so inclined s sahai , uk it seems typical of " new britain " to desecrate a world popular monument by installing a piece of modern art -lrb- ? -rrb- .
never mind that it does not fit into the ambiance of trafalgar square , never mind that it has no historic significance whatsoever , and never mind that most tourists will just laugh at it .
even if people think of this as a work of art , there are better places in london to install it than at trafalgar square .
on the plus side , it offers plenty of graffiti space for those so inclined , and perhaps they will shall now leave the other statues in the square alone .
s sahai , uk the nation 's fourth plinth at trafalgar square should be devoted to the country 's finest hour in modern times - the battle of britain .
a statue of an raf pilot should therefore grace it .
adrian m shryane , united kingdom i like the work but it is not appropriate for the location .
the statuary in the square depicts those who have battled for britain over the centuries -lrb- for good or ill -rrb- .
if a non-militaristic subject is required who better than alan turing who through his work with others at bletchley park invented one of the first computers , decoded the nazi codes and arguably swung the balance against hitler 's war machine .
that he was subsequently persecuted to the point of suicide by the british establishment is something to be atoned for .
antony , uk since the square is dedicated to the battle of trafalgar , and since admiral nelson is honoured with a column , it is only right that admiral collingwood , nelson 's second in command and the man who actually won the battle after nelson made his excuses and left -lrb- okay died -rrb- , is also honoured .
johnny , newcastle uk what 's all the fuss about ?
rachel whiteread obviously has a sense of humour and the " culture minister " took it seriously .
paul , gloucester , england no doubt the usual luddites will come crawling out of the woodwork complaining about " modern art " .
it is a refreshing change to have some unusual sculptures occupying the empty plinth in trafalgar square .
it 's so much better than the imperial statues of military generals that seem to infest london .
dave whyte , uk if there must be a statue , let it be darwin .
let 's celebrate one of the greatest british scientists in history rather than yet another military man or politician .
tom k , uk as one commentator observed , " art is passionate , thought out and inspiring " .
it 's even easier than that - art is whatever it wants to be .
if this is a result of an effort not to offend anyone , then how come it seems to have offended so many ?
i like it - it 's drawn attention to the fact that nobody cared that there was nothing on the block until now !
jonathan barrett , scotland i read in the paper today that " it " is not here to stay , but will be sold off in a few months , thank goodness for that .
the sooner the better .
as it is trafalgar square , has no one got the skills to erect a model of hms victory to put on the plinth ?
colin mackay , uk it reflects exactly the depths this politically correct country has fallen to peter , uk it reflects exactly the depths this politically correct country has fallen to that there is not a hero or statesman in modern times worth putting on a plinth .
we are dead as a nation and this just consolidates the point .
peter , uk incredible that rachel whiteread - an " artist " who i , at least , have never heard of making anything other than casts of things - should come to the conclusion that the most appropriate sculpture for this plinth should be ... a cast !
lucky for her , really - if anything else had been more appropriate , she 'd have been out of the running .
mark rendle , uk hold on !
a sculpture of an empty plinth ?
let 's have a competition to see who can design a sculpture to sit on it ! !
al , uk ok , so some may not consider it art .
so what ?
mat , united kingdom ok , so some may not consider it art .
so what ?
trafalgar square is , ultimately , a very dull place .
why not brighten it up ?
if ninety percent of the people that see it think , " hmm , that 's a bit odd , i do n't like that much ! " then at least they 've noticed it and taken the time to form an opinion .
how often does anybody actually stop and consider any of the other works on display there , i wonder ?
mat , united kingdom in the year 2001 i would think a huge , black , humming monolith would be an appropriate choice .
essada , uk stop trying to foist your limited aesthetic judgement on the rest of us toby , uk it is disappointing to read that so many people have such a narrow view of art and fail to see their comments in the context of history .
many seem to think of " art " as merely representation or illustration - this constitutes only a small part of the " art " spectrum and other , more stimulating , work should be given a fair airing .
those who decry modern art today are the same people who piously condemned other past masters , such as monet , in their day .
to them : stop trying to foist your limited aesthetic judgement on the rest of us , we have enough of your dry , repetitive , insipid dross surrounding us already !
toby , uk to michael uk .
being a member of the " vast majority of the public -lsb- who -rsb- do n't understand a sculpture " , i was rather hoping you could explain what it all means it to me .
after all i 'm a reasonably intelligent person with a degree , i can speak several languages and play the piano but somehow i just do n't get it .
to me it just looks like a clear reflection of a plinth .
what does this mean ?
how can our reaction to a transparent box tell us anything of value about ourselves ?
perhaps it humorous ; what do you put on a plinth that has been empty for so long ?
a plinth .
i 'm hardly overcome with mirth .
or is it perhaps the case that something so mundane and irrelevant has no meaning in itself ?
if i look at a traditional sculpture at least i understand something of the relationship between artist and subject and something of the world and politics of the time .
this is just a boring idea which says nothing .
now i would concede that perhaps i 'm not sophisticated enough to understand this work .
but the problem with that is that i not convinced by anybody who claims they are .
we are always being told that this or that something is " important " , has " resonance " , " meaning " but no one can tell you exactly why these things are true .
and in my view the reason for this is that it is just fashion , not art .
graham , uk reading these responses is so depressing - it 's art !
it 's meant to make you become aware , or feel , or be angry or just think something .
it does n't have to be any good , and you do n't have to like it - but so many people saying what a waste of money it is and that they 'd rather have a statue of some bigoted xenophobe from the national military history ?
these are the same people who 've made big brother the focal point of culture in this country .
it 's a sad comment on all of us .
bob trivers , uk i adore modern art , and this new fourth plinth is brilliant , but in the wrong place , in trafalgar square , we should have our history , there are much nicer places to put modern art on display in london , and i think the idea that the fourth plinth should have anything on at all just goes to show , how much our politicians -lrb- including london 's mayor -rrb- are trying to wipe out our past .
angela , gb right !
that 's it .
i 'm moving overseas .
goodbye sweet britain .
i 'll come back as soon as you are feeling better .
be good ...
ha , london , uk art is supposed to stimulate the senses , provoking emotion such as love , hate , calm , etc .
this waste of space has been thought up by some " clever " artist who is spending too much time contemplating her own navel and not enough time actually creating something that is exciting and relevant .
the only emotion that this old idea will stir in me is nausea .
daniel james , london , uk i think it 'll be great !
it 's modern , quirky and clever !
i think we may tire of it after some time , but that 's why there 's to be a rotating selection .
public art is always tricky as it needs to be challenging , different from the accepted norms to be noticed , and yet relevant at the same time .
i say well done to the artists and also to the selectors for making a difficult choice without taking themselves too seriously .
richard , uk the plinth is cute but i think a serious work would be better as nothing ages quite so fast as a joke .
this is what you call re-inventing the wheel .
look at something , think that it would be a great idea to copy it and call it " art " , then get all the luvvies drooling about how stunning it is .
next thing you know , someone will copy a bus stop and make 50 grand out of it .
here , wait a . sorry , got to go now . i feel an inspiration coming on !
joe , uk i 'd also be keen on a statue of mandela looking over towards the south african embassy on the east side of the square .
i find it sad that many commentors are using their own ignorance of history as a reason to put an abstract work on the site .
presumably these people would turn the british library over to collecting dvd 's on the grounds that most people have n't read all the books it contains now .
thomas worthington , uk there is a place for modern art , however trafalgar square is not it .
either leave it empty or commission a statue in keeping with the rest of the square .
caron , england why ca n't there be statues of british people who have done something worthwhile for mankind ian , england whitehall is full of statues celebrating war .
why ca n't there be statues of british people who have done something worthwhile for mankind eg edward jenner -lrb- vaccination -rrb- ?
ian , england i 'm sure rachel is very talented .
but this sculpture is most inappropriate for this plinth .
it is not in keeping with its surroundings or neighbours .
it should be used for a special statesman / woman - or even the queen mother .
david warburton , uk the plinth is an excellent showcase for sculpture .
some have been excellent , some not so good , but at least new art is getting a very public airing .
it does not matter whether whiteread 's work is on its own , only that we keep getting interesting pieces shown up there .
much rather that than a permanent stuffed shirt or worthy .
and i am what you might call a " force of conservatism " ...
james mcrae , uk i believe nelson mandela should be up there immortalised in stone kirk , uk there are more worthy sculptures that should go up .
for example , captain cook who - apart from being an understudy of nelson - discovered most of the southern part of the pacific .
personally , i believe nelson mandela should be up there immortalised in stone .
kirk , uk the " plinth " looks far more exciting than any of the suggestions and other temporary exhibits seen so far .
a statue of a person can only be ephemeral , as the one on the other plinth shows ; who is it , and does anybody remember him ?
if the plinth were always guaranteed to be clear and sparkling , perhaps made out of solid glass , it would raise a smile for generations to come , without ever raising a question mark .
dave swindell , england if we are told it is a success , it will be a success .
if the media treat it like the millennium dome , it will fail .
why something so boring would be popular escapes me .
personally i would n't touch what passes for ' art ' at present with a ten-foot pole - either because it 's a rotting cow or it is n't there .
over the ages past art was usually the result of the search for beauty and represented those things which mattered to us the most .
its present state can only be explained by us thinking we already found those things and need to move on or that they are n't there to be found .
it is a sad thing if either is true .
natalia n , uk i do not see this pulling the crowds chris klein , england i do not see this pulling the crowds .
however , i am full of admiration for people who have the audacity to call this art and to demand and receive payment for their efforts .
chris klein , england what a waste of money .
surely they could have spent the money on something better like a poster propaganda campaign or something .
alan perry , great britain so the new ' statue ' is going to be a large plastic box .
as an indicator of today 's disposable society , i suppose it makes sense .
boring , but appropriate .
however , the big question has to be - who 's going to keep cleaning it once the pigeons have - ahem - christened it ? !
kevin , london , uk my god !
and someone 's getting paid for this ? ? ! ! !
sam , uk it 's just an architectural feature - not art .
very dull .
wayne , england next time , give me a call and i 'll ask my wee one to knock something up from some lego .
doug , the netherlands the plinth will soon be vandalised and blackened with grime emily burton , uk give it time - you 'll see that just like everything else in our tarnished capital , the plinth will soon be vandalised and blackened with grime .
given a few months , i 'm fairly certain that it will reflect nothing more than the naive hopes of a nation desperately trying to forget who we are and where we 've come from .
emily burton , uk oh dear , oh dear , oh dear .
mike , australia this is an inspiring work of art , it shows the struggle of the great british nation against oppressive invaders , it displays the glory of the mighty royal navy , and finally , it promises us a magnificent future of an ultramodern , hip , young great britain !
edwin , usa , formerly uk it is a witty piece that is meant to disorientate - and to delight !
chand , united states this makes us re-think our ideas about the place .
how many times have you taken a bus ride through the square and thought about what it celebrates - the naval victory , nearly 200 years ago now , of one nascent empire over another .
the reaction this sculpture brings is a measure of how much and how little britain has changed in the ensuing centuries .
it is a witty piece that is meant to disorientate - and to delight !
it stands in contrast to the somber pomposity of the bronzed generals that surround it .
literally , it turns things on their head .
two hundred years from now rachel whiteread will be noted as an inventive , forthright and arresting sculptor - long after the ideas of great britain as a seafaring empire have dimmed .
chand , united states in 10 or 20 years you 're going to realise what happened to britain , and this " statue " is going to describe the political correctness that is behind everything .
peter b , usa -lrb- ex - uk -rrb- people judge this monument too much on aesthetic purposes .
i think using trafalgar square to promote contemporary art is a brilliant idea .
even though many may not like it , it at least opens an avenue to the arts in britain where most contemporary art is misrepresented in the media .
john ngo , uk the notion that art should be about passions and emotions is a fine demonstration of why the public at large should have no say about what goes on the fourth plinth in trafalgar square .
this idea was boring and staid in the nineteenth century !
the last thing we need is more jingoistic rubbish like the other statues , and second-last is a romantic revival !
patrick , uk even rembrandt was thought to be sensationally radical when he first painted michael , uk with due respects to the traditionalists who have written in , they should remember that even rembrandt was thought to be sensationally radical when he first painted .
just because the vast majority of the public do n't understand a sculpture does n't mean it is n't great sculpture .
i fully support the scheme for the fourth plinth , and would like to add that the notion of putting up a statue of william iv now would be a horrific backward step .
the statues that were put on the first three plinths were hardly exciting in their time , and it would be an unimaginable shame to make another one like them when we could do something imaginative .
michael , uk like some other commentators i like whiteread 's work but i do n't think her plinth is the best idea for trafalgar square .
her " house " was superb as a way of expressing how we normally overlook the spaces that surround things in deference to the things themselves , and her holocaust memorial -lrb- a cast of a library -rrb- is excellent .
my vote would go to " ecce homo " which was the life-size statue of jesus christ as a normal , vulnerable man by -lrb- i think -rrb- mark wallinger .
it fits with the other plinths in that they have minor and major historical figures on them , but it subverts the idea of overblown oversized monuments .
alan simpson , uk this is 2001 .
how about a black monolith ?
tom , bristol i can just hear all those pigeons cheering !
sj , us sarah justesen , united states no matter what you try to do , art always reflects the people who created it .
in years to come , this piece of art will identify us as a people who could n't think of anything .
jon livesey , usa it gets people talking if nothing else jim , uk just as the london eye and tate modern are symbols of a healthy and creative country , so the " plinth on a plinth " dares to be original and modern .
this is a good thing .
it gets people talking if nothing else .
jim , uk an appropriate observation on the present state of the nation .
vacant and devoid of innovation aaron daly , canada dull , unimaginative , uninspiring , thoughtless pap .
a true testament to modern british culture .
tom , uk as the square is about the military bravery that made britain great , and the plinth is directly infront of the canadian embassy , i think the statue should have represented the canadians that helped us all during ww2 dave mison , usa while the sculpture has some good points , it will not be in keeping with the others in trafalgar square .
the ideal sculpture for the plinth would have been ' britannia ' a symbol for the whole of the country .
dave , uk ' art ' just continues to joke itself into oblivion andrew denny , uk ' art ' just continues to joke itself into oblivion .
we 've had an empty plinth quite happily for 150 years , and the fact that it 's empty is now part of the look of the square .
why the urge to put something on it ?
if it moves , salute it .
if it does n't move ... well , just leave it alone !
or at least put a traditional colonial statue there - at least it 'll be in character .
andrew denny , uk i like whiteread 's work , but not for trafalgar square .
the only fitting sculpture so far was the jesus figure .
i clark , england what about a statue representing all the people who are bored with politics and are unlikely to vote !
michael dupree , united kingdom this piece of work would probably look great in the newly developed areas of canary wharf etc .
but not in trafalgar square , what about a statue representing all the people who are bored with politics and are unlikely to vote !
michael dupree , united kingdom first we had a piece of blu-tack shortlisted for the turner prize , now a plinth on a plinth for trafalgar square - whatever next ?
ca n't we gather all these people in one place and leave them to amuse each other .
nick , uk now it is clear that william iv should sit astride the plinth , but for the sum of money he fail to bequeath on his death .
the money should be found to erect the intended statue to complete the masterpiece that trafalgar square was designed to be .
these funds are to come from the remaining budget for erecting a lasting monument or the lottery funds , heritage section .
at least this will prevent any re-invention of our history by future generations .
paul higbee , england am i right in thinking that nelson and trafalgar square are a celebration of the military bravery which helped make britain great ?
once again it appears that our history as a nation of brave men is to be subjected to political correctness in order not to offend anyone .
james , england " hey guys , i 've got an idea , let 's put a plinth on the plinth ! "
martin , uk full marks for the idea , which is original , but to me it looks comical .
if that is the effect , then it has worked .
if not ... well , it 's one of those good ideas you get in the pub at 10:30 just before the last pint and giggle about for the next thirty minutes .
" hey guys , i 've got an idea , let 's put a plinth on the plinth ! "
probably best left as an idea than realised , but still , it 's more interesting than a stuffy old statue of some dull old statesman or a boring old monarch wielding his monocle .
martin , uk if the ' purpose ' of public art is to stimulate the minds of the public and provide a focus for personal reflection and discussion , no doubt any piece of art placed bang in the middle of one of london 's most prominent public spaces would cause controversy - too conservative for some , too drastic for others .
therefore the plinth has already fulfilled it 's ' function ' .
as for the plinth being popular , whether you like an object or not is a matter of personal taste ; beauty is always in the eye of the beholder .
i reserve judgement until i 've seen it for real myself .
heather , manchester , uk i understand what the artist is trying to do / say with her proposal however it will lose its gloss very quickly with the amount bird mess that will decorate it .
i know what it does to my car so a clear block will soon become rather unclear !
andy girvan , scotland art is passionate , thought out and inspiring emmett brady , uk evidently , this is the kind of rubbish tom stoppard was talking about when he addressed the royal academy .
out of all of the things you could put on a plinth , you choose a mould of itself ?
and that 's art ! ?
art is passionate , thought out and inspiring .
this was obviously doodled on the back of a napkin in 5 minutes by someone with less skills than a builder ...
emmett brady , manchester , uk i revel in this triumph ' the progressive ' movement for decent art .
not only is this piece practical but also it 's satisfying the aesthetic standards of ' our day ' .
nice .
robert tripe , england i walked past the still covered sculpture on saturday night .
i think it is going to fit in very well with it 's surroundings .
the sculpture is both innovative and unobtrusive , and it 's a far cry from the old colonial statues that usually occupy plinths like that .

select the link below to watch talking point on air corruption is back in the spotlight following the jailing of france 's former foreign minister , roland dumas .
mr dumas was caught in a huge web of corruption centred around the state oil giant elf aquitaine .
but his is not the only recent case .
in the philippines , former president joseph estrada is being prosecuted for illegal enrichment .
senior indian politicians were recently filmed taking bribes from fake arms dealers .
and this is only the highly visible side of corruption .
every day , ordinary people have to bribe just to get basic services , like a telephone or an official document .
is corruption inevitable ?
what is the cost of all this backhand dealing , and who is paying it ?
what is it like in your country ?
lyse doucet was joined by jeremy pope from transparency international for talking point on air , a radio phone-in programme on bbc world service .
you can add to the debate by using the form below .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme i had an accident with a cyclist .
he got hurt and was bleeding .
i sent him to hospital in an auto rickshaw and went to police station to register the accident .
the police demanded rs.200 to take complaint .
to push the case quickly , the police demanded another 200 .
then , after two weeks i appeared before the judge in the court .
the judge and lawyer had a tie .
if i do n't pay 100 for judge , then judge would penalize me for rs.1000.
otherwise i would pay rs.500 as penalty and rs.100 for judge .
to accept the penalty , the cashier in the court demanded rs.25.
with whom can i lodge a complaint ?
or where do you want to bang your head ?
i slowly learnt to forgive 99 dirty creatures for one good soul .
human is predatory , nothing satisfies him .
ramesh , india what is important is to keep the rule of law so that corruption is minimised pete swinford , usa to corrupt something is to alter its purity .
as long as we have the genetically provided motivation to pursue advantage , corruption will be a path to said advantage .
what is important is to keep the rule of law so that corruption is minimised , increasing opportunity for the rest of society , which reduces the need for corruption .
pete swinford , lafayette , indiana , usa the history of corruption is as old as mankind and as such has eaten deep into the fabric of all societies .
anyone that thinks he can eradicate corruption is performing an impossible task .
however , it can be curtailed .
saave linus , lagos , nigeria of course , corruption is inevitable if the wrong leaders are in power .
politicians are human beings and part of our role as voters , in such countries as can vote , is to make a judgement of the candidates to decide who is a moral being and who is not .
that is not to say we should not be tough on those politicians who are corrupt ; they deserve everything they get .
but in a democracy , the only people with the power to make things better are the common voters .
daniel wareing , england , uk corruption will always occur as long as there are greedy and self-serving people in positions of power and influence .
trying to wipe out corruption is a waste of time - it will always happen , either openly or discreetly .
the trick is not to get caught - a trick that obviously dumas never learnt .
mark o 'neill , würzburg , germany anyone with integrity is unable to make it politically or in big business leigh , usa -lrb- uk orig -rrb- corruption is inevitable , for as long as we continue to encourage and promote the success of corruptible people through business and politics .
i do n't concede that dishonesty is a fundamental human trait ; it just seems that way because anyone with integrity is unable to make it politically or in big business .
as soon as anybody with real political principle makes their views known in a public forum they are labelled with some puerile tag like " loony left " , tony benn being a good example .
in a world where money , and the desire to accumulate it , is the absolute driving force in every society then who else can you expect to be in charge other than people whose personal ambitions extend no further than their bank accounts ?
leigh , usa -lrb- uk orig -rrb- corruption is like cancer .
it spreads like cancer .
there is no cure for corruption .
it is everywhere .
in india it is also everywhere .
you ca n't stop it .
it is like an everyday thing .
you have to give bribe in order to get your work done .
if you do n't take bribe , you will get your transfer order next day .
if the top politicians take bribe , then who will stop the lower working class people to take bribe ?
it all starts from the top .
i wish someone could find a cure for corruption .
rajeev soorma , usa corruption is a social ill that spares no people , no colour , no social stratum and no country .
however , it is very relative and manifests itself in various forms but gnaws the pride of the people , thwarts bureaucracies and perverts justice .
corruption could run from sexual favours , appointments to under-table cash .
but though done in secret , corruption can never and will never be buried .
even when we succeed to bury it , years after it will resurrect and witness against its very fathers and mothers .
hamilton ayuk , cameroon us it is time that we as a society took the blame for the culture of corruption kus , ktm , nepal if i talk about my own country , where the average person only has complaints for the rife corruption and impropriety in decision making , it is people who voted for them , there are still intellectuals who support them and most likely they will win election again .
but if we look across the general society -lrb- in city -rrb- , almost everybody is looking to cheat - meters in taxis are tampered with , if you do not know the price , the shopkeeper will charge you more , and the example goes on .
so why do we only blame others ?
it is time that we as a society took the blame for the culture of corruption and improved the perception of right and wrong and what is acceptable .
kus , ktm , nepal there is nowhere that is totally free of corruption as long as people are involved .
there is little overt corruption in canada , but it is always difficult to see problems in your own house .
there are places in the world where corruption is a way of life .
i believe that penalties for persons in positions of authority or political power should be very high .
because they are in authority , they must be held to the highest possible standard and , when caught , pay the highest possible price for the abuse of that authority .
no one is perfect , but we expect those in positions of trust to be trustworthy .
ken klakowich , vancouver , canada as alexander hamilton put it so succinctly , " if angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary " .
t.j. cassidy , usa as regards corruption , anyone who observes and understands human nature and human behaviour would have to be brain dead to think that corruption is not a basic feature in human activity .
it is too bad that here in the usa we can not do something to reduce the amount of corruption , but we can not .
the cynic , cincinnati usa the system has continued for years joe ryan , paris , france corruption in france was inevitable .
despite the revolution a " you scratch my back , i 'll scratch yours " elite is created by the highly structured education system that exists .
right and left rub shoulders at institutions that set them aside from the common man and breed a ' corporatism ' that invades public life .
with a very acquiescent media , highly prone to political pressure , the system has continued for years .
however , young judges and politicians , born post wwii , seem to want to make the system more transparent .
joe ryan , paris , france i 'm sure that regardless of where they are , politicians the world over enjoy a bit of corruption now and then .
it might be interesting to find out if those higher-ranking politicians have participated , though .
they may have been clever enough not to get caught out .
arkady , tokyo , japan corruption in the usa is not as bad on a personal level , as in the philippines or in mexico .
however , on another level , it can be amazing .
the way political campaigns are funded explains just why george bush jr was appointed president and his many activities as governor of texas .
big oil got exemptions from pollution regulations .
forming a union will get you fired .
public health is a shame , but we do have great highways .
joe , texas , usa defeating corruption requires vigilance .
vigilance requires the selfless efforts of a critical mass of moral individuals in society to help stomp out corruption .
unfortunately the contemporary social attitude is pure self-absorption , and society is increasingly full of apathy and full of the unpatriotic .
the corrupt love the lazy and love those who quietly enjoy seeing harm being done - so corruption prevails .
stephen kenney , usa people are only human and all human beings are prone to succumbing to temptation .
how about installing a complex , moderated computer system to run governments around the world ?
you ca n't bribe a machine !
tim , london , uk it 's an abuse of the very standards that the human race sets itself to uphold phil w , bristol , uk because corruption exists , does not mean to say it 's right .
it 's an abuse of the very standards that the human race sets itself to uphold .
if finland can uphold such high standards , and still do well , why ca n't others ?
phil w , bristol , uk in scotland , parliament voted on some legislation to compensate fishermen , only for the executive to overturn the democratic will of the people because it did n't suit them .
if that was done in a country like iraq it would be considered the height of corruption , yet in voting-apathetic britain this is accepted without fuss .
that 's democracy for you : politicians are allowed to be corrupt , but only with the tacit consent of the people .
john mcvey , scotland an inevitable phenomenon in the global community debebe d , london , uk i could not agree more that corruption is an inevitable phenomenon in the global community .
i strongly believe that the practice , though relative to locations , is an endemic component of our economic fabric .
this tends to be true whether it 's a market economy , socialist and / or traditional systems .
the difference being on how it is regulated and to what extent it is tolerated by societies .
i think no one could cite a corruption free country / system or disprove it otherwise .
debebe d , london , uk living as we humans do , bribery , corruption , or lobbying is our ancient method of bartering .
what we need is to have a global governance representative of the people working at the grassroots level , so that no human is poor and no human is exceedingly rich , as wealth is measured where i live as your health .
oiling the wheel of the machine just means someone else gets crushed in the process .
working to one peaceful , loving end is the only way on a large scale .
jason , canada corruption is inevitable .
human nature makes it unavoidable .
peter bolton , uk in us the easiest way to stop petty corruption in society is to forget the concept that all services should be supplied equally to all people .
this is a very hard step to take and to some extent undermines the equality of citizens in a society .
but it is the correct step .
r. tay , singapore in this part of switzerland people talk of " copinage " - a sort of " it 's who you know " .
it is considered quite normal by respectable individuals to use links with people they know to get jobs , obtain favours or even avoid police punishment .
is this corruption ?
david henderson , sion , switzerland in developing countries corruption is rife because wages are really low .
it is accepted as part of life by the people and viewed merely as a means of oiling the machinery to get daily activities done smoothly without hassle .
corruption takes many forms and in developed countries it is camouflaged as lobbying .
multinational corporations pay for costly political campaigns and when their candidate wins it is pay back time .
chin swee , australia your comments during the programme transparency international has done an excellent job here in slovakia in the past few years viliam , slovakia transparency international has done an excellent job here in slovakia in the past few years .
it has made the issue of corruption a permanent topic of discussion , and a good number of public figures have had to leave their posts in disgrace , labelled as corrupt - while the te 's slovak representative has been proclaimed the woman of the year !
but there 's still a long way to go , especially at lower levels - hospitals , school entry examinations , permits , etc .
such cases rarely hit the news ...
viliam , slovakia as long as society is capital orientated , corruption is inevitable .
we 're living in a society where everyone wants to amass as much wealth as he / she can .
someone wants to be a millionaire , and a millionaire wants to be a billionaire .
so some will try dubious means to get to the top quicker .
danny kwapa , botswana everywhere you go you see corruption .
i 've just come back from syria and could n't believe what i saw - you have to pay for everything there .
at the airport i even had to pay for my passport so that i could get it earlier than other people .
karzan abdullah , atlanta , usa in my country corruption used to be common practice everywhere from a higher level to the lower grass roots .
it was becoming part of our traditional cultural values and it was feared that it might not be controlled by the government of pakistan .
now things have changed a bit under the military regime .
but it is still a far-fetched idea to say that corruption can be removed from the world .
it 's like a contagious disease which has infected the whole structure of government .
saima ahsan , pakistan corruption is inevitable edward , zug , switzerland corruption is inevitable , but certain circumstances can increase it to grotesque proportions .
here elected parliamentary members are expected to be board members of various businesses as their only source of income .
this region also has very low tax rates which have combined to make corruption such a way of life in providing a high and regular source of revenue that it seems to be no longer noticed .
for many , therefore , it ceases to be a problem of conscience .
edward , zug , switzerland i 'm from ecuador in south america where corruption is just part of our lives .
two years ago i got my id and driver 's licence stolen from my car .
the right thing to do was to go and apply for them again .
but it was a process that could take too long , so i did what everybody else does , i paid someone to get the documents for me .
jorge a. almeida chiriboga , toowoomba , australia should we leave behind or give tips when a service is rendered ?
should we give presents on birthdays or during festive seasons ?
if ' yes ' to all of the above , are we not practising and encouraging a kind of corruption ?
philip qcn , singapore your comments before we went on air limit politicians to a fixed term in office werner l. stunkdl , lake forest , illinois , usa the only way to minimise graft is to limit politicians to a fixed term in office .
there are so many professional politicians , particularly in the us .
for example , former president clinton has never worked in the private sector !
werner l. stunkdl , lake forest , illinois , usa having had the " good fortune " of attending a private school in one of the most highly corrupt countries in the world -lrb- bangladesh -rrb- , i was able to see corruption in action from very close quarters .
i was surrounded by the sons and daughters of the elite , most of whom have amassed their enormous fortunes , courtesy of rampant corruption .
asif hadi , sydney , australia what is corruption ?
accepting an expensive pair of shoes for turning a blind eye to the activities of a friendly company is .
but surely , so is accepting campaign funds from big corporations and then reneging on global environmental treaties ?
it 's just that little bit harder to be caught red-handed .
david gatenby , düsseldorf , germany there are no inevitable crimes jarek , poland rule no.1 : corruption is an ordinary crime !
rule no.2 : there are no inevitable crimes !
personally i 'm very glad to watch the news nowadays which clearly show that no politician , neither in the far east nor in the " civilized " west can feel safe when taking bribes .
no matter how powerful he is ... or used to be .
mr. kohl and mr. dumas ...
jarek , poland is there any country in this world that is not corrupt ?
corruption exists because there is a giver and a taker .
the giver corrupts because he wants the rules to be bent so that he can make a quick profit .
the taker need corrupt money to satisfy his .
as long as there is greed in a society there will be corruption .
one might say india , indonesia , nigeria , and the philippines are the most corrupt of all nations in the world .
i would include usa .
the american president is elected through a complicated system that paves the way for business lobbies to fund parties for future favours .
just one example ; no president would go against china trade in spite of human rights violations because of american investments in china .
this is an example of indirect corruption .
venkat , hongkong as appeared on these web pages and in the economist , the least corrupt nation in the world is finland .
as an englishman living here for a few years now , i can understand why .
the finns are also the third most competitive nation in the world in terms of economic performance , government and business efficiency and infrastructure -lrb- time may 7th from world competitiveness yearbook -rrb- .
this proves that it can pay not to be corrupt and still be very effective in business .
mark , helsinki , finland whether we accept it or not , it is everywhere kadavul , san jose , usa in one country it is called fund-raising -lrb- forgetting about following decisions , the administration makes in favour of the donors -rrb- , and in some other country it is straight pay-upfront-and-get what you want .
whether we accept it or not , it is everywhere .
however we should also accept that not all are corrupt .
i had a chance to act corrupt in my career with government , but never succumbed to it .
kadavul , san jose , usa it takes a strong character to withstand temptation in high places ...
ron brandenburg , rijswijk , the netherlands bribery , corruption , embezzlement has always been with us - its human nature .
i think the 95 % of people , given the opportunity , would accept a bribe - if they thought that no one would know .
barry , london accepting that corruption is widespread , albeit a lot less obvious in first world countries than in developing or third world countries , the problem is that those who see it and report it are the losers .
how can this be changed ?
how can the " whistle blower " be supported and upheld ?
cameron davis , lagos , nigeria to say it is inevitable is to condone it c whybrow , philippines it is all very well for the protesters in america and europe to call for forgiveness of debt to third world countries , saying that debt is keeping them in poverty .
in reality corruption in government is what is bringing these countries to their knees .
to say it is inevitable is to condone it .
chris w whybrow , baguio city , philippines i thought the whole reason that bureaucracies were invented was n't to eliminate corruption , but to minimize corruption by compartmentalizing and limiting the damage that anyone person can do .
but methinks the paradigm has changed in the age of automation , as now a single person in the right spot with the inclination and skill can wreak havoc .
edward l. nemil , us i guess the comment about " power corrupts " comes to peoples mind , but i do n't take that negative view .
it assumes that everybody is corruptible , it assumes the concept of original sin to be true .
i think it is more accurate to say : " power attracts the corruptible " .
there can be honesty in politics / business / etc , but we are force-fed a diet of movies and media that tell us that everyone has skeletons in their closet .
the majority no longer look for , hope for nor expect honesty , and the expectation breeds the result .
alain , england power simply corrupts , and that is why we should simply not trust people with power , be it a politician or the saint next door !
harry , leeds , uk the issue of corruption will never go away until we reach the utopia , where everybody 's dreams of a better life have been fulfilled .
as long as poverty , class , hegemony of control , etc exist there will be corruption .
" what is in it for me ? " , as i call it here in kenya , will continue to bring down politicians , and other people of power .
in west africa the ibos say " he who brings kola brings life " , i think this is corruption in the essence of the struggle to excel , in today 's rat-race job market and super profit goals .
alire , nairobi , kenya where there is power there is corruption , always has been always will be ...
patrik , stockholm , sweden it 's surprising it 's not more widespread jc , sweden lets face it , most of us would like a good salary hike .
what happens if you refuse ?
thankfully as a laboratory worker i 'm not in a " bribeable " situation .
it does seem to be part of business culture in some far eastern countries though .
sad .
it 's surprising it 's not more widespread .
jc , sweden in my country we had so much corruption .
we were in major debt with our allies and our financial connections for example with the world funds .
we were in so much trouble when nawaz sharif was in power ... he was found to have taken most of the money and saved it for himself .
our military decided enough is enough and ousted the money hungry pm out of office .
this year i came back to see the country i had once left and saw a major positive change .
there are more jobs , less poverty , more water , more food , more security and the list goes on .
it is good to have an uncorrupt regime .
so whatever the world says about us getting back to democracy , they should first see what kind of corruption they have in their government .
ali , pakistan corruption is part of us .
we all want to hook some up or if we want something done and we know someone , we consider it easily done .
it is ingrained in our speech when we say that we know the right people or " we have the right contacts " .
these right contacts may have to bend a little too , in order to accommodate our requests .
basically when one person causes the other to be corrupt , none of them is less guilty than the other .
but as long as our mentality remains like this , we are destined to be a corrupt race , some more than others .
hansel ramathal , new jersey , usa can be minimised within a properly designed and maintained regime p , uk due to human nature it is inevitable , but can be minimised within a properly designed and maintained regime - in the same way as most of us do n't burgle our neighbours ' houses .
however , it is far more likely now since the last tory government replaced the notion of public service with that of authority without responsibility. p , uk a certain amount is inevitable .
certainly reliance on economic systems with little or no competition for services , where success is determined by who one knows is more than what one knows , virtually guarantees a higher level of corruption .
this is obviously true for more strongly socialist systems because one party -lrb- the government -rrb- provides so many of life 's services or make all of the decisions and they are a monopoly .
george milton , baltimore md and rome italy corruption almost goes with the job mike , england power breeds corruption .
the more power a person has , the more corrupt they tend to be .
it 's a simple truth .
very few people have the personal self-control required to prevent them from abusing the system .
then , once the first abuse has occurred , which may be very minor , more and worse abuses come easier and easier .
you can see it everywhere .
in business , if a director gets caught committing some serious offence , they normally take early retirement or just leave .
they do n't normally get prosecuted or sacked .
politicians are very similar .
corruption almost goes with the job .
there are also different types of corruption .
is claiming benefits you are technically allowed , but morally should n't corruption ?
is claiming for 1st class air fares and actually travelling by train corruption -lrb- eu meps -rrb- ?
mike , england corruption is only inevitable if your organisation has poor systems of control , lazy management and an ethos of corruption .
something that can not be said about our much maligned public services .
our civil service as an example is probably one of the finest in the world well controlled and full of people with a genuine public servant spirit .
how easily such ideals are lost if they are not nurtured .
gerry , scotland unfortunately this seems to be the way of things these days .
there is such a focus in society on being rich that greed has taken over .
people are susceptible to money , at the end of the day , we all need it , but we can not stop at what we need , we have to have more .
to get to the position of importance , unfortunately it may be necessary to get there by not strictly legitimate means , as if you do n't act underhandedly , someone else will .
unfortunately the good guys rarely win these days .
andrew , uk yes , in any organization where power and money flow freely corruption is going to and does happen .
however we must remember that a lot of our politicians become civil servants out of a feeling of duty and a bond with their fellow citizens .
many truly want to serve their neighbours and do whatever they can to make sure their concerns are voiced .
it is sad a few bad apples ruin the perception of our elected officials .
paul barden , trail creek in the usa it is not wise to generalise corruption as inevitable .
kabali , australia i think that it is not wise to generalise corruption as inevitable .
rather i think the primary cause for corruption in the modern world is due to its current emphasis on the automatic acceptance of any profit , sustained growth forever , more comfort at the expense of anything and the growth of multi-national organisations even if they do not care a mote about the well-being of its employees or the local inhabitants .
kapali viswanathan , brisbane , australia .
-lrb- indian -rrb- the issue of " corruption " is not very well defined ; personally , i broadly translate the word as " abuse of power " .
in this case , corruption is everywhere .
businessmen earning half a million pounds a year surely do not do enough work to merit that amount of money !
the only demarcation line between estrada , dumas and the boss of railtrack is the issue of legality .
morally , however , these cases are the same .
chris , cambridge , uk it seems that a taboo has fallen peillex , france as far as corruption in france is concerned , the sentence imposed on mr dumas is setting the ground for others .
we 've heard about the case of roland dumas unfolding for quite some time without really being able to predict when justice impose a sentence on him .
it comes as a bit of blow .
i think it does no harm to see the corruption issue being tackled in our country , although they are politicians for whom i have no more respect than dumas , mr pasqua , mr tiberi on the right wing for instance .
even president chirac is threatened .
it seems that a taboo has fallen or rather is in the process of falling in france and that corruption is meant to be condemned .

select the link below to watch talking point on air corruption is back in the spotlight following the jailing of france 's former foreign minister , roland dumas .
mr dumas was caught in a huge web of corruption centred around the state oil giant elf aquitaine .
but his is not the only recent case .
in the philippines , former president joseph estrada is being prosecuted for illegal enrichment .
senior indian politicians were recently filmed taking bribes from fake arms dealers .
and this is only the highly visible side of corruption .
every day , ordinary people have to bribe just to get basic services , like a telephone or an official document .
is corruption inevitable ?
what is the cost of all this backhand dealing , and who is paying it ?
what is it like in your country ?
lyse doucet was joined by jeremy pope from transparency international for talking point on air , a radio phone-in programme on bbc world service .
you can add to the debate by using the form below .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme i had an accident with a cyclist .
he got hurt and was bleeding .
i sent him to hospital in an auto rickshaw and went to police station to register the accident .
the police demanded rs.200 to take complaint .
to push the case quickly , the police demanded another 200 .
then , after two weeks i appeared before the judge in the court .
the judge and lawyer had a tie .
if i do n't pay 100 for judge , then judge would penalize me for rs.1000.
otherwise i would pay rs.500 as penalty and rs.100 for judge .
to accept the penalty , the cashier in the court demanded rs.25.
with whom can i lodge a complaint ?
or where do you want to bang your head ?
i slowly learnt to forgive 99 dirty creatures for one good soul .
human is predatory , nothing satisfies him .
ramesh , india what is important is to keep the rule of law so that corruption is minimised pete swinford , usa to corrupt something is to alter its purity .
as long as we have the genetically provided motivation to pursue advantage , corruption will be a path to said advantage .
what is important is to keep the rule of law so that corruption is minimised , increasing opportunity for the rest of society , which reduces the need for corruption .
pete swinford , lafayette , indiana , usa the history of corruption is as old as mankind and as such has eaten deep into the fabric of all societies .
anyone that thinks he can eradicate corruption is performing an impossible task .
however , it can be curtailed .
saave linus , lagos , nigeria of course , corruption is inevitable if the wrong leaders are in power .
politicians are human beings and part of our role as voters , in such countries as can vote , is to make a judgement of the candidates to decide who is a moral being and who is not .
that is not to say we should not be tough on those politicians who are corrupt ; they deserve everything they get .
but in a democracy , the only people with the power to make things better are the common voters .
daniel wareing , england , uk corruption will always occur as long as there are greedy and self-serving people in positions of power and influence .
trying to wipe out corruption is a waste of time - it will always happen , either openly or discreetly .
the trick is not to get caught - a trick that obviously dumas never learnt .
mark o 'neill , würzburg , germany anyone with integrity is unable to make it politically or in big business leigh , usa -lrb- uk orig -rrb- corruption is inevitable , for as long as we continue to encourage and promote the success of corruptible people through business and politics .
i do n't concede that dishonesty is a fundamental human trait ; it just seems that way because anyone with integrity is unable to make it politically or in big business .
as soon as anybody with real political principle makes their views known in a public forum they are labelled with some puerile tag like " loony left " , tony benn being a good example .
in a world where money , and the desire to accumulate it , is the absolute driving force in every society then who else can you expect to be in charge other than people whose personal ambitions extend no further than their bank accounts ?
leigh , usa -lrb- uk orig -rrb- corruption is like cancer .
it spreads like cancer .
there is no cure for corruption .
it is everywhere .
in india it is also everywhere .
you ca n't stop it .
it is like an everyday thing .
you have to give bribe in order to get your work done .
if you do n't take bribe , you will get your transfer order next day .
if the top politicians take bribe , then who will stop the lower working class people to take bribe ?
it all starts from the top .
i wish someone could find a cure for corruption .
rajeev soorma , usa corruption is a social ill that spares no people , no colour , no social stratum and no country .
however , it is very relative and manifests itself in various forms but gnaws the pride of the people , thwarts bureaucracies and perverts justice .
corruption could run from sexual favours , appointments to under-table cash .
but though done in secret , corruption can never and will never be buried .
even when we succeed to bury it , years after it will resurrect and witness against its very fathers and mothers .
hamilton ayuk , cameroon us it is time that we as a society took the blame for the culture of corruption kus , ktm , nepal if i talk about my own country , where the average person only has complaints for the rife corruption and impropriety in decision making , it is people who voted for them , there are still intellectuals who support them and most likely they will win election again .
but if we look across the general society -lrb- in city -rrb- , almost everybody is looking to cheat - meters in taxis are tampered with , if you do not know the price , the shopkeeper will charge you more , and the example goes on .
so why do we only blame others ?
it is time that we as a society took the blame for the culture of corruption and improved the perception of right and wrong and what is acceptable .
kus , ktm , nepal there is nowhere that is totally free of corruption as long as people are involved .
there is little overt corruption in canada , but it is always difficult to see problems in your own house .
there are places in the world where corruption is a way of life .
i believe that penalties for persons in positions of authority or political power should be very high .
because they are in authority , they must be held to the highest possible standard and , when caught , pay the highest possible price for the abuse of that authority .
no one is perfect , but we expect those in positions of trust to be trustworthy .
ken klakowich , vancouver , canada as alexander hamilton put it so succinctly , " if angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary " .
t.j. cassidy , usa as regards corruption , anyone who observes and understands human nature and human behaviour would have to be brain dead to think that corruption is not a basic feature in human activity .
it is too bad that here in the usa we can not do something to reduce the amount of corruption , but we can not .
the cynic , cincinnati usa the system has continued for years joe ryan , paris , france corruption in france was inevitable .
despite the revolution a " you scratch my back , i 'll scratch yours " elite is created by the highly structured education system that exists .
right and left rub shoulders at institutions that set them aside from the common man and breed a ' corporatism ' that invades public life .
with a very acquiescent media , highly prone to political pressure , the system has continued for years .
however , young judges and politicians , born post wwii , seem to want to make the system more transparent .
joe ryan , paris , france i 'm sure that regardless of where they are , politicians the world over enjoy a bit of corruption now and then .
it might be interesting to find out if those higher-ranking politicians have participated , though .
they may have been clever enough not to get caught out .
arkady , tokyo , japan corruption in the usa is not as bad on a personal level , as in the philippines or in mexico .
however , on another level , it can be amazing .
the way political campaigns are funded explains just why george bush jr was appointed president and his many activities as governor of texas .
big oil got exemptions from pollution regulations .
forming a union will get you fired .
public health is a shame , but we do have great highways .
joe , texas , usa defeating corruption requires vigilance .
vigilance requires the selfless efforts of a critical mass of moral individuals in society to help stomp out corruption .
unfortunately the contemporary social attitude is pure self-absorption , and society is increasingly full of apathy and full of the unpatriotic .
the corrupt love the lazy and love those who quietly enjoy seeing harm being done - so corruption prevails .
stephen kenney , usa people are only human and all human beings are prone to succumbing to temptation .
how about installing a complex , moderated computer system to run governments around the world ?
you ca n't bribe a machine !
tim , london , uk it 's an abuse of the very standards that the human race sets itself to uphold phil w , bristol , uk because corruption exists , does not mean to say it 's right .
it 's an abuse of the very standards that the human race sets itself to uphold .
if finland can uphold such high standards , and still do well , why ca n't others ?
phil w , bristol , uk in scotland , parliament voted on some legislation to compensate fishermen , only for the executive to overturn the democratic will of the people because it did n't suit them .
if that was done in a country like iraq it would be considered the height of corruption , yet in voting-apathetic britain this is accepted without fuss .
that 's democracy for you : politicians are allowed to be corrupt , but only with the tacit consent of the people .
john mcvey , scotland an inevitable phenomenon in the global community debebe d , london , uk i could not agree more that corruption is an inevitable phenomenon in the global community .
i strongly believe that the practice , though relative to locations , is an endemic component of our economic fabric .
this tends to be true whether it 's a market economy , socialist and / or traditional systems .
the difference being on how it is regulated and to what extent it is tolerated by societies .
i think no one could cite a corruption free country / system or disprove it otherwise .
debebe d , london , uk living as we humans do , bribery , corruption , or lobbying is our ancient method of bartering .
what we need is to have a global governance representative of the people working at the grassroots level , so that no human is poor and no human is exceedingly rich , as wealth is measured where i live as your health .
oiling the wheel of the machine just means someone else gets crushed in the process .
working to one peaceful , loving end is the only way on a large scale .
jason , canada corruption is inevitable .
human nature makes it unavoidable .
peter bolton , uk in us the easiest way to stop petty corruption in society is to forget the concept that all services should be supplied equally to all people .
this is a very hard step to take and to some extent undermines the equality of citizens in a society .
but it is the correct step .
r. tay , singapore in this part of switzerland people talk of " copinage " - a sort of " it 's who you know " .
it is considered quite normal by respectable individuals to use links with people they know to get jobs , obtain favours or even avoid police punishment .
is this corruption ?
david henderson , sion , switzerland in developing countries corruption is rife because wages are really low .
it is accepted as part of life by the people and viewed merely as a means of oiling the machinery to get daily activities done smoothly without hassle .
corruption takes many forms and in developed countries it is camouflaged as lobbying .
multinational corporations pay for costly political campaigns and when their candidate wins it is pay back time .
chin swee , australia your comments during the programme transparency international has done an excellent job here in slovakia in the past few years viliam , slovakia transparency international has done an excellent job here in slovakia in the past few years .
it has made the issue of corruption a permanent topic of discussion , and a good number of public figures have had to leave their posts in disgrace , labelled as corrupt - while the te 's slovak representative has been proclaimed the woman of the year !
but there 's still a long way to go , especially at lower levels - hospitals , school entry examinations , permits , etc .
such cases rarely hit the news ...
viliam , slovakia as long as society is capital orientated , corruption is inevitable .
we 're living in a society where everyone wants to amass as much wealth as he / she can .
someone wants to be a millionaire , and a millionaire wants to be a billionaire .
so some will try dubious means to get to the top quicker .
danny kwapa , botswana everywhere you go you see corruption .
i 've just come back from syria and could n't believe what i saw - you have to pay for everything there .
at the airport i even had to pay for my passport so that i could get it earlier than other people .
karzan abdullah , atlanta , usa in my country corruption used to be common practice everywhere from a higher level to the lower grass roots .
it was becoming part of our traditional cultural values and it was feared that it might not be controlled by the government of pakistan .
now things have changed a bit under the military regime .
but it is still a far-fetched idea to say that corruption can be removed from the world .
it 's like a contagious disease which has infected the whole structure of government .
saima ahsan , pakistan corruption is inevitable edward , zug , switzerland corruption is inevitable , but certain circumstances can increase it to grotesque proportions .
here elected parliamentary members are expected to be board members of various businesses as their only source of income .
this region also has very low tax rates which have combined to make corruption such a way of life in providing a high and regular source of revenue that it seems to be no longer noticed .
for many , therefore , it ceases to be a problem of conscience .
edward , zug , switzerland i 'm from ecuador in south america where corruption is just part of our lives .
two years ago i got my id and driver 's licence stolen from my car .
the right thing to do was to go and apply for them again .
but it was a process that could take too long , so i did what everybody else does , i paid someone to get the documents for me .
jorge a. almeida chiriboga , toowoomba , australia should we leave behind or give tips when a service is rendered ?
should we give presents on birthdays or during festive seasons ?
if ' yes ' to all of the above , are we not practising and encouraging a kind of corruption ?
philip qcn , singapore your comments before we went on air limit politicians to a fixed term in office werner l. stunkdl , lake forest , illinois , usa the only way to minimise graft is to limit politicians to a fixed term in office .
there are so many professional politicians , particularly in the us .
for example , former president clinton has never worked in the private sector !
werner l. stunkdl , lake forest , illinois , usa having had the " good fortune " of attending a private school in one of the most highly corrupt countries in the world -lrb- bangladesh -rrb- , i was able to see corruption in action from very close quarters .
i was surrounded by the sons and daughters of the elite , most of whom have amassed their enormous fortunes , courtesy of rampant corruption .
asif hadi , sydney , australia what is corruption ?
accepting an expensive pair of shoes for turning a blind eye to the activities of a friendly company is .
but surely , so is accepting campaign funds from big corporations and then reneging on global environmental treaties ?
it 's just that little bit harder to be caught red-handed .
david gatenby , düsseldorf , germany there are no inevitable crimes jarek , poland rule no.1 : corruption is an ordinary crime !
rule no.2 : there are no inevitable crimes !
personally i 'm very glad to watch the news nowadays which clearly show that no politician , neither in the far east nor in the " civilized " west can feel safe when taking bribes .
no matter how powerful he is ... or used to be .
mr. kohl and mr. dumas ...
jarek , poland is there any country in this world that is not corrupt ?
corruption exists because there is a giver and a taker .
the giver corrupts because he wants the rules to be bent so that he can make a quick profit .
the taker need corrupt money to satisfy his .
as long as there is greed in a society there will be corruption .
one might say india , indonesia , nigeria , and the philippines are the most corrupt of all nations in the world .
i would include usa .
the american president is elected through a complicated system that paves the way for business lobbies to fund parties for future favours .
just one example ; no president would go against china trade in spite of human rights violations because of american investments in china .
this is an example of indirect corruption .
venkat , hongkong as appeared on these web pages and in the economist , the least corrupt nation in the world is finland .
as an englishman living here for a few years now , i can understand why .
the finns are also the third most competitive nation in the world in terms of economic performance , government and business efficiency and infrastructure -lrb- time may 7th from world competitiveness yearbook -rrb- .
this proves that it can pay not to be corrupt and still be very effective in business .
mark , helsinki , finland whether we accept it or not , it is everywhere kadavul , san jose , usa in one country it is called fund-raising -lrb- forgetting about following decisions , the administration makes in favour of the donors -rrb- , and in some other country it is straight pay-upfront-and-get what you want .
whether we accept it or not , it is everywhere .
however we should also accept that not all are corrupt .
i had a chance to act corrupt in my career with government , but never succumbed to it .
kadavul , san jose , usa it takes a strong character to withstand temptation in high places ...
ron brandenburg , rijswijk , the netherlands bribery , corruption , embezzlement has always been with us - its human nature .
i think the 95 % of people , given the opportunity , would accept a bribe - if they thought that no one would know .
barry , london accepting that corruption is widespread , albeit a lot less obvious in first world countries than in developing or third world countries , the problem is that those who see it and report it are the losers .
how can this be changed ?
how can the " whistle blower " be supported and upheld ?
cameron davis , lagos , nigeria to say it is inevitable is to condone it c whybrow , philippines it is all very well for the protesters in america and europe to call for forgiveness of debt to third world countries , saying that debt is keeping them in poverty .
in reality corruption in government is what is bringing these countries to their knees .
to say it is inevitable is to condone it .
chris w whybrow , baguio city , philippines i thought the whole reason that bureaucracies were invented was n't to eliminate corruption , but to minimize corruption by compartmentalizing and limiting the damage that anyone person can do .
but methinks the paradigm has changed in the age of automation , as now a single person in the right spot with the inclination and skill can wreak havoc .
edward l. nemil , us i guess the comment about " power corrupts " comes to peoples mind , but i do n't take that negative view .
it assumes that everybody is corruptible , it assumes the concept of original sin to be true .
i think it is more accurate to say : " power attracts the corruptible " .
there can be honesty in politics / business / etc , but we are force-fed a diet of movies and media that tell us that everyone has skeletons in their closet .
the majority no longer look for , hope for nor expect honesty , and the expectation breeds the result .
alain , england power simply corrupts , and that is why we should simply not trust people with power , be it a politician or the saint next door !
harry , leeds , uk the issue of corruption will never go away until we reach the utopia , where everybody 's dreams of a better life have been fulfilled .
as long as poverty , class , hegemony of control , etc exist there will be corruption .
" what is in it for me ? " , as i call it here in kenya , will continue to bring down politicians , and other people of power .
in west africa the ibos say " he who brings kola brings life " , i think this is corruption in the essence of the struggle to excel , in today 's rat-race job market and super profit goals .
alire , nairobi , kenya where there is power there is corruption , always has been always will be ...
patrik , stockholm , sweden it 's surprising it 's not more widespread jc , sweden lets face it , most of us would like a good salary hike .
what happens if you refuse ?
thankfully as a laboratory worker i 'm not in a " bribeable " situation .
it does seem to be part of business culture in some far eastern countries though .
sad .
it 's surprising it 's not more widespread .
jc , sweden in my country we had so much corruption .
we were in major debt with our allies and our financial connections for example with the world funds .
we were in so much trouble when nawaz sharif was in power ... he was found to have taken most of the money and saved it for himself .

mike , england corruption is only inevitable if your organisation has poor systems of control , lazy management and an ethos of corruption .
something that can not be said about our much maligned public services .
our civil service as an example is probably one of the finest in the world well controlled and full of people with a genuine public servant spirit .

kapali viswanathan , brisbane , australia .
-lrb- indian -rrb- the issue of " corruption " is not very well defined ; personally , i broadly translate the word as " abuse of power " .
in this case , corruption is everywhere .
businessmen earning half a million pounds a year surely do not do enough work to merit that amount of money !
the only demarcation line between estrada , dumas and the boss of railtrack is the issue of legality .
morally , however , these cases are the same .
chris , cambridge , uk it seems that a taboo has fallen peillex , france as far as corruption in france is concerned , the sentence imposed on mr dumas is setting the ground for others .
we 've heard about the case of roland dumas unfolding for quite some time without really being able to predict when justice impose a sentence on him .
it comes as a bit of blow .
i think it does no harm to see the corruption issue being tackled in our country , although they are politicians for whom i have no more respect than dumas , mr pasqua , mr tiberi on the right wing for instance .
even president chirac is threatened .
it seems that a taboo has fallen or rather is in the process of falling in france and that corruption is meant to be condemned .

the world famous austrian composer , who died in 1791 , showed the symptoms of a disease caused by eating badly-cooked pork infected by a worm , an american doctor has said .
mozart 's symptoms , including a fever , rash , limb pain and swelling , match those brought on by trichinosis , according to dr jan v hirschmann of seattle 's puget sound veterans affairs medical center .
his death was put down to a " severe miliary fever " at the time , and no autopsy was carried out .
letter previous theories about what killed the composer , who died aged 35 , include rheumatic fever , kidney stones , heart disease , pneumonia and poisoning .
there have also been suggestions of foul play concerning rival composer antonio salieri .
but dr hirschmann points to a letter mozart wrote to his wife 44 days before he fell ill .
" what do i smell ? ... pork cutlets !
che gusto -lrb- what a delicious taste -rrb- .
i eat to your health , " he wrote .
trichinosis has an incubation period of about 50 days , says dr hirschmann , who is an infectious disease specialist .
his eight-page report is based on details from medical literature , historical documents and biographies .
dr hirschmann admitted that not being able to be proved wrong " makes it much more enjoyable to speculate " .
theories mozart 's grave was dug up seven years after his death so it could be reused , and his remains were dispersed .
dr faith fitzgerald , davis professor of music at the university of california , last year put forward the theory that mozart died of rheumatic fever .
she said there were about 150 different theories about the cause of the composer 's death .
" it does strike me as somewhat strange the investment people have in something that is virtually unknowable , " she said .
doctors like to speculate on the composer 's death because " it 's fun and because it 's mozart , " dr fitzgerald said .
