gerry murphy , chief executive of carlton communications dismissed comments made by granada boss as " hysterical scaremongering " .
in a leaked letter to tony blair , granada chief executive charles allen had warned that his company was vulnerable to takeover approaches from foreign companies , and that the digital terrestrial channel ondigital could be forced to close because of the delay to legislation lifting cross-media ownership restrictions .
carlton is reported to have issued a point-by-point rebuttal of mr allen 's letter , casting doubt over a future merger between the two media groups .
the two itv companies , and their ondigital joint venture , have been hard hit by the slump in advertising .
resisting a merger carlton said that a merger with granada was neither inevitable nor necessary and stressed that it was possible to continue in partnership .
analysts say that granada favours a merger in order to share rising costs because of the downturn in advertising .
but carlton is thought to object to the idea since it is the much smaller partner and does not want to be swallowed up .
news of the escalating row comes the day after a leading media forecaster said that itv will this year suffer its worst slump in advertising since the start of commercial television 50 years ago .
one of the reasons behind the slump is the cutback in global ad spending by us multinationals in the face of economic slowdown .

an action plan is being drawn up and emergency procedures reconsidered in flintshire - one of the worst-hit areas last winter .
as it was the first time that many people had their homes inundated by water , there was a lack of information to determine which of the emergency services , council , or environment agency , should be contacted flintshire county council draft report the plan - which will be considered on tuesday - will identify which agency is responsible for the work to be carried out , and will provide a timetable within which tasks have to be completed .
the move follows a series of public meetings with victims of the floods which wreaked havoc in the county in october and november .
many of those affected were furious that when they sought help they were passed from one agency to another , or from one council department to another .
officials say change is needed and the role of the different services needs to be clarified .
so far flintshire county council has spent £ 900,000 on 39 different emergency schemes within the council .
but it has also asked the welsh assembly for another £ 2m to carry out a further 36 remedial schemes to prevent further flooding in the future .
the precise cost of the works requested by residents has not been finalised .
a draft report to be considered says that emergency planning procedures which provide the immediate response to a flooding crisis should be reviewed .
internal information procedures are also to be considered - so that the key services and staff , as well as front line services , are all made aware of a crisis situation and necessary responses made .
sandbags the report suggests that the roles and responsibility of the county council , the emergency services , and the environment agency , need to be clarified .
at the moment , it says , there is great confusion which leads to public frustration in times of emergency .
severe flooding hit many communities on 6 november and the council had more than 60 workmen filling and dispatching 18,000 sandbags .
a dozen schools were closed and more than 60 people were evacuated from mold and rhydymwyn and put up in an emergency centre .
' meaningful ' plan many roads were closed as flooding hit homes and businesses throughout flintshire .
the council 's environment forum held seven meetings with affected communities before drawing up its report .
the document says that the council needs to work with the emergency services and the environment agency to complete a meaningful action plan .
public consultation highlighted the lack of communication in the immediate period after the flooding .
" as it was the first time that many people had their homes inundated by water , there was a lack of knowledge and information to determine which of the emergency services , council or environment agency should be contacted to help , " the report says .
" responses at the meetings indicate that the council emergency line was continually busy or the staff who answered were unwilling or unable to help . "

a federal appeals court has rejected napster 's plea for a rehearing in the landmark lawsuit which ended with the service being barred in march from facilitating trade in copyrighted songs .
observers said they were not surprised by the court decision , which , while published on monday , was made on friday .
and they also warned over the fallout from a full trial being brought by the music industry giants which have spent 18 months on napster 's trail .
napster fights on if the recording firms win the case at trial , they could come out of it being owed more in damages than napster is worth , said ric dube , an analyst with research firm webnoize .
his comments came despite a deal three weeks ago in which napster signed a deal with bmg , emi and aol time warner - three of the record companies behind the legal action .
" the major companies can come out of this owning napster , " he said .
napster , however , has not ruled out a further appeal , to the us supreme court over the march injunction .
" we will review our legal options going forward , " said jonathan schwartz , napster 's general counsel .
and mr schwartz was unsurprised by the court decision .
" we recognized going in that rehearing petitions are infrequently granted , " he said .
and the launch of a new secure membership service later this summer will bring to an end many of the record industry 's outstanding legal issues , according to mr schwartz .
long battle monday 's statement marks the latest in a long fight by napster to defend its service , which allows users to swap music files online .
record companies , fearing the service would cost them billions of dollars in lost music sales , in december 1999 opened legal action against napster a us appeals court in february found the firm was infringing on the copyrights held by the music giants , and ordered the issuing of the march injunction .
napster , which has since introduced new software in an effort to block swapping of copyrighted music , has seen its user figures plummet .
about 360 million files were traded through napster in may , compared with 2.79 billion in february , webnoize said .
napster on friday introduced new software to ensure that users can still share songs not covered by the injunction .
