some 90 racially motivated attacks have been reported to the police already this year and the situation is said to be at boiling point .
there are around 4,500 asylum seekers in scotland and most of them are in glasgow .
dr von kaehne , speaking on bbc scotland 's frontline programme , said he has to treat refugees for a variety of injuries sustained in the attacks in the sighthill area of the city .
he said : " i probably see every second day a casualty sheet saying that someone has been assaulted and has attended a hospital in glasgow .
" these casualties have been assaulted and have injuries such as broken bones and broken noses .
" they come to me with bruises and injuries to their eyes where they have been hit , and sometimes even bigger injuries .
" fortunately so far i have not had any major lasting injuries here but i think it is only a question of time the way it is going , and i 'm very , very worried . "
dr kaehne , who works at the city 's fernbank clinic , said the asylum seekers living in sighthill were now too scared to leave their flats .
the plight of the saada family - who sought refuge in scotland from the conflict in palestine - is highlighted on the programme .
brothers haitham and iyad saada have been forced into hiding because they fear for their lives after being assaulted a month ago .
haitham sadda 's young daughter reen is now too scared to go to school and refuses to leave the family 's sighthill flat .
life in sighthill for many of them is a living hell dr von kaehne he said : " the punches and kicks we got were out of hatred and bitterness .
the people , they looked at us with deep hatred . "
in another incident , shwan kareen saeed - who fled saddam hussein 's regime in iraq - said he was stabbed in an unprovoked attack .
he said : " about 15 scottish teenagers came for me when i was outside my flat .
" there were two or three knives and they stabbed me in the stomach . "
dr von kaehne said sighthill locals were victimising the refugees .
the doctor said : " these people are restricted to their flats .
life in sighthill for many of them is a living hell . "
strathclyde police has put more officers on the beat in the area , along with interpreters , in a bid to make the area safer .
chief superintendant allan burnett said : " some of the people in sighthill are carrying out racist attacks but that is the tiny minority .
" the huge majority of people in the area want to enhance glasgow 's reputation . "
but as the number of asylum seekers in the area has grown , so has the resentment among local residents .
glasgow city council , which will get £ 100m from the home office over five years to house and support the asylum seekers , has been attacked over its handling of the situation .
a number of refugee groups have criticised the lack of resources and support available and say there was not enough preparation before the houses were let to refugees .
some residents believe the asylum seekers , who come from across the globe , are being given better treatment than they are .
they allege that the asylum seekers are being given extra funding and perks such as satellite tv .
one woman said : " my windows are nailed shut and nobody is listening to me .
these people are getting everything in their houses and i 'm sitting in a house that 's falling apart . "
council spokesman archie graham said some residents did not understand why the refugees were being housed alongside them .
he also admitted the council could have done more to ease the situation , saying : " we 're prepared to learn lessons and we 're prepared to improve communications , there 's no question about that . "
frontline scotland is being broadcast at 2200bst on bbc two on tuesday .

the system - being piloted in llandovery , west wales - allows those farmers unable to attend conventional stock auctions to buy animals they see on screen .
the move is an important step forward in allaying farmers ' fears over finding livestock in the wake of the slaughter of tens of thousands of animals in wales .
auctioneers have spent the last few weeks videoing cattle at 46 farms and they now hope to sell them during a screening at llandovery rugby club next week .
livestock markets were last held in the area more than three months ago and there has been little sign of them being reinstated .
auctioneers clee , tompkinson and francis came up with the idea of creating a video catalogue of more than 500 cattle , cows , calves and bulls .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases uk-wide 1,697 - with 93 in wales powys - 56 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 16 cases caerphilly 2 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 3 skewen - 1 abercynon - 1 it is the first occasion such a system has been used in wales and , if it proves popular , it could be extended to other areas .
farmer gethin havard , from sennybridge in mid wales has been unable to sell his animals for three months .
he believes the video auction benefit farmers in more than just business terms - as foot-and-mouth restrictions have meant many have been cut off from their friends for several months .
" a lot of farmers , quite apart from going to this auction to do business , will be able to meet their friends once again and try to put their problems into perspective , " he said .
price squeeze " it will help them to realise that there are other people who have similar problems . "
earlier this month , farmers in north wales expressed their concerns that produce prices paid by supermarkets would be squeezed further , following news that no livestock auctions would take place until the end of the year .
the markets were suspended at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth and since then the price of animals slaughtered at abattoirs has been negotiated by the multi-nationals .
but hard-hit farmers have complained that they are not getting a fair deal .

auctioneers clee , tompkinson and francis came up with the idea of creating a video catalogue of more than 500 cattle , cows , calves and bulls .

farmer gethin havard , from sennybridge in mid wales has been unable to sell his animals for three months .
he believes the video auction benefit farmers in more than just business terms - as foot-and-mouth restrictions have meant many have been cut off from their friends for several months .
" a lot of farmers , quite apart from going to this auction to do business , will be able to meet their friends once again and try to put their problems into perspective , " he said .
price squeeze " it will help them to realise that there are other people who have similar problems . "
earlier this month , farmers in north wales expressed their concerns that produce prices paid by supermarkets would be squeezed further , following news that no livestock auctions would take place until the end of the year .
the markets were suspended at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth and since then the price of animals slaughtered at abattoirs has been negotiated by the multi-nationals .
but hard-hit farmers have complained that they are not getting a fair deal .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- ' police see minorities as soft targets ' low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 5 june , 2001 , 07:10 gmt 08:10 uk ' police see minorities as soft targets ' researchers interviewed 100 black and asian officers police officers are targeting ethnic minorities , because of the need to meet performance indicators , according to research seen by the bbc .
a report published in the journal ethnic and racial studies , and shown to bbc radio five live , indicates that some officers see ethnic minority groups as " soft targets " when they are under pressure to boost levels of crime detection .
the study , which draws on lengthy interviews with 100 black and asian officers , says pressure to produce results has made officers more inclined to target ethnic minority groups - particularly in the inner cities .
one asian officer admitted : " if things are slow , you almost subconsciously find yourself targeting blacks . "
stephen lawrence : attacked at bus stop the report concludes that this racial profiling , rather than bigotry or xenophobia , is responsible for police racism .
in february 1999 , the official inquiry into the death of the black teenager stephen lawrence made 70 recommendations into improving police attitudes to racism .
but the report , by sir william macpherson , prompted criticism for striking a blow at police morale .
mr lawrence , 18 , died after being stabbed at a bus stop in eltham , south-east london , in april , 1993 .
