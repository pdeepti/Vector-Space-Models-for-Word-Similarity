it emerged on monday that rod lynch - announced as the new chief executive of visitscotland just five days ago - would not be taking up the post the tourism agency withdrew the job offer after the extent of his commitments to an essex air freight company became clear .
henry mcleish , wendy alexander , and alasdair morrison must make full public statements outlining their role in this shambles snp leader john swinney scottish national party leader john swinney and tory leader david mcletchie have called on ministers to take responsibility for the " shambles " and resign .
first minister henry mcleish is to hold the first meeting of his cabinet after the easter break amid the growing crisis over the appointment of mr lynch .
controversy engulfed the announcement on thursday after it emerged that mr lynch would be using a business trip to the unites states for " leisure purposes " .
opposition parties accused him of being insensitive to the needs of the scottish tourist industry at a time when it is struggling to cope with the effects of foot-and-mouth disease .
further allegations about his private life and reports of a row between first minister henry mcleish and enterprise minister wendy alexander over the timing of his appointment also added to the controversy .
revelations about mr lynch 's plan to combine the £ 145,000 job as chief executive of visitscotland with his post as chairman of essex-based air cargo firm global supply systems added fuel to the fire .
visitscotland said in a statement : " with regret , following clarification of the nature of rod lynch 's other commitments , visitscotland 's offer of employment to him to be chief executive has had to be withdrawn .
" the executive nature of his contract with global supply systems was incompatible with his intended role as chief executive of visitscotland . "
' mismanagement ' claims the move followed a meeting between scottish executive ministers and visitscotland chiefs .
the executive said it was not making any comment about the decision taken by visitscotland .
mr swinney said : " just last thursday , labour ministers were trumpeting rod lynch 's appointment , but now he has been ignominiously dumped .
" this is an astonishing litany of incompetence and mismanagement by labour ministers , who have treated the scottish tourism industry - scotland 's biggest employer - in a shameful manner as it faces its biggest ever challenge .
" henry mcleish , wendy alexander , and alasdair morrison must make full public statements outlining their role in this shambles .
" the government approved rod lynch 's appointment , so there can be no hiding place for the responsible ministers .
" this is the biggest mess of henry mcleish 's crisis-ridden administration .
parliament question " any minister or ministers involved in this catastrophe should follow rod lynch , and offer their resignation from office . "
the snp has said it plans to table a question in the parliament about the whole selection process for mr lynch 's post .
tory leader david mcletchie blamed scottish ministers for the fiasco surrounding mr lynch 's appointment .
he said : " bitter experience has taught us to expect embarrassing fiascos and humiliating climbdowns from the scottish executive , but this sorry episode really does take the biscuit .
" the foot-and-mouth crisis has brought our tourism industry to its knees , but all labour and the lib dems managed to do was pour petrol on the flames .
" it took only a matter of days for rod lynch to be exposed as being more of a hindrance than a help to scottish tourism .
" you have to wonder how much longer we will have to wait before henry , wendy and the rest of the executive 's hangers on are informed that they have long outlived their own uselessness . "

the company had previously expected to start offering the much-heralded new services in tokyo by the end of may in what would have been the world 's first commercial 3g operation .
a docomo spokesman said further tests were needed to ensure the technologically sophisticated system worked properly .
the new launch date would be 1 october although an " introductory " service would be available from the end of may , docomo said .
global delay ?
analysts said the delay would n't be damaging to docomo 's profits - the company had only bargained on 150,000 3g subscribers for the first year - but would add to the unease of telecoms investors around the world about prospects for 3g .
docomo had been expected to lead the way in 3g , both in terms of technology and in showing which new services appealed to consumers .
" there 's a possibility this could delay the start of global 3g services , " said motoharu sone , an analyst at tsubasa securities in tokyo .
cagey concerns about the expense of 3g , both for providers and consumers , have been a significant factor behind the sharp falls in the market value of telecoms companies since last year .
at present , many providers are extremely cagey about their expectations for 3g while analyst forecasts for 3g use and revenues vary tremendously .
big doubts appear to remain as to whether the new services will be sufficiently attractive and competitively priced to prompt a mass upgrading by users from their existing 2 or 2.5g phones .
ntt docomo - which has about 60 % of the japanese wireless market - already offers a number of mobile phone services beyond the standard voice services .
the main driver of the innovation has been the i-mode service , which allows its more than 22 million subscribers to receive e-mail , download data and access internet portals via their mobile phone .
at & t acquisition like many other mobile phone operators , docomo has also built up large debts in the past few years , through acquisitions and the high cost of developing 3g .
among the acquisitions are a 16 % stake in at & t wireless - which some industry observers view as a prelude to taking full control of the us firm 's wireless division - and investments in kpn mobile of the netherlands , the uk 's hutchison 3g , hong kong-based hutchison telephone and taiwan .
to help finance this , docomo in january carried out japan 's biggest sale of new shares by a listed company .
this year , the company has also taken out a 1,200bn yen loan from five japanese banks and sold $ 180bn worth of five and 10-year bonds .
criticism these developments have not passed without criticism .
some analysts said docomo was destroying shareholder value by buying at & t wireless shares at a 35 % premium and then paying for them by issuing new shares - a move that diluted the holdings of its existing shareholders .
other forms of finacing would have been quite possible , they said .
one suggestion was that docomo 's senior management had been keen on the equity financing because it would dilute the stake of ntt to a level where it no longer had the right to dissolve the board or replace directors .
the government has said it wants ntt to reduce its more than 60 % stake in docomo to less than 50 % .
