a team from the gulf war research unit at king 's college london sent questionnaires to a large random sample of british service personnel who served in the 1991 gulf war .
a high proportion of people who served in the gulf feel ill as a result of symptoms which they have labelled as gulf war syndrome dr matthew hotopf of 2,961 respondents , 17 % believed they had gulf war syndrome .
if this sample is representative , about 9,000 of 53,000 british service personnel believe they have contracted it .
the existence of gulf war syndrome is hotly disputed in medical circles .
the term has been used to describe a variety of symptoms and illnesses experienced by veterans of the conflict .
due to the variety of symptoms reported by veterans , some believe that gulf war syndrome may be a collection of different illnesses with different causes rather than a single one .
the symptoms include insomnia , fatigue , headaches , confusing , joint and muscle pain , nausea , swollen glands and fevers .
the researchers found that those people who thought they had gulf war syndrome were in a poorer state of health than those who did not .
they also found that personnel who thought they had gulf war syndrome were more likely to know someone else who also believed they had the condition .
vaccinations however , they were also more likely to have received a high number of vaccinations before deployment to the gulf .
many have claimed they are ill as a result of exposure to organophosphates or the chemicals contained in injections designed to protect personnel from biological warfare methods .
the ministry of defence runs a medical assessment programme available to any gulf war veteran concerned about their health .
" alarming " findings however , the number of veterans making inquiries is declining , and the future of the programme is in doubt .
the researchers say that because people who serve in the armed forces are partly chosen because of their good health , their findings are " alarming " .
they also warn that armed forces personnel may be less inclined to take part in health protection programmes intended to protect against the threat of chemical and biological warfare .
researcher dr matthew hotopf told bbc news online : " a high proportion of people who served in the gulf feel ill as a result of symptoms which they have labelled as gulf war syndrome . "
he said that he was not convinced that there was one specific gulf war syndrome .
but dr hotopf said the evidence did suggest that serving in the gulf had damaged some people 's health .

the decline was made worse by a new methodology introduced to reflect today 's consumer trends more accurately .
the result was a 0.9 % drop in core consumer price inflation barring fresh food , a figure thought to be 0.3 % worse than it would have been under the old system .
according to the japanese government , the data showed the " deflationary trend had become clearer " under the new figures .

the fall is less than was seen in june , when production fell 2 % .
but on a year-on-year basis , the fall reached 5.9 % , the worst figures since october 1998 , when the asian currency crisis caused an annualised 8.8 % drop .
according to the national statistics office , the worldwide slump in technology spending is largely to blame .
semiconductor exports were the main contributor to the decline , with computer and car production adding to the pain .
inventories piling up the nso also said inventories are expanding , up 15.2 % year on year in july , while factory utilisation was down to 71 % from 74.1 % in june .
and wholesale orders also weakened , adding to the pressure for further cuts in south korean interest rates .
lim ji-won , economist at jp morgan in seoul , said the wholesale downturn was surprising .
" it showed the gloom from flagging exports is quickly filtering through to the private sector , " he said .
and kwon hyeuk-boo , from the daishin economic research institute , said output is set to get even worse .
" the chances are high that economic conditions in korea and abroad would become worse in the months ahead , hurting consumer sentiment and resulting in lower consumption , " he said .
" the bank of korea will surely cut interest rates one or two times more to help boost the economy .
but they wo n't do that in september , given that august consumer price inflation was higher than expected . " $ 110bn on reforms the news comes as the cost of economic reforms in south korea is beginning to become clearer .
according to government figures , about 137.5trn won -lrb- $ 110bn ; £ 75bn -rrb- of public funds has been spend on restructuring banks and companies since the currency crisis of 1997-8 .

the fall is less than was seen in june , when production fell 2 % .
but on a year-on-year basis , the fall reached 5.9 % , the worst figures since october 1998 , when the asian currency crisis caused an annualised 8.8 % drop .
according to the national statistics office , the worldwide slump in technology spending is largely to blame .
semiconductor exports were the main contributor to the decline , with computer and car production adding to the pain .
inventories piling up the nso also said inventories are expanding , up 15.2 % year on year in july , while factory utilisation was down to 71 % from 74.1 % in june .
and wholesale orders also weakened , adding to the pressure for further cuts in south korean interest rates .
lim ji-won , economist at jp morgan in seoul , said the wholesale downturn was surprising .
" it showed the gloom from flagging exports is quickly filtering through to the private sector , " he said .
and kwon hyeuk-boo , from the daishin economic research institute , said output is set to get even worse .
" the chances are high that economic conditions in korea and abroad would become worse in the months ahead , hurting consumer sentiment and resulting in lower consumption , " he said .
" the bank of korea will surely cut interest rates one or two times more to help boost the economy .
but they wo n't do that in september , given that august consumer price inflation was higher than expected . " $ 110bn on reforms the news comes as the cost of economic reforms in south korea is beginning to become clearer .
according to government figures , about 137.5trn won -lrb- $ 110bn ; £ 75bn -rrb- of public funds has been spend on restructuring banks and companies since the currency crisis of 1997-8 .
about a quarter of that is unlikely ever to be recouped , the government said , although 34.2trn won has already been recovered .
and a further 500bn won is on its way to hyundai 's trust units , to help smooth their sale to us financial services group aig .

party political broadcasts , blamed for exacerbating chronic voter apathy at the last general election , could be scrapped .
the electoral commission , which oversees elections , is currently conducting a review of party political broadcasting and will report next year .
voter turnout in the us is even lower than it was here in june gerald kaufman mp among the proposals being considered are us-style 30-second adverts , according to friday 's daily telegraph .
a mori poll found the number of voters who saw any of the party election broadcasts at the last election had fallen to 55 % , compared with 73 % in 1997 .
sam younger , chairman of the commission , was reported as saying that he was keen to find ways to make watching party election broadcasts " more attractive to viewers " .
voter insult but the proposal to abolish longer broadcasts was greeted with scepticism by some mps .
gerald kaufman , chairman of the commons select committee for culture , media and sport , told the newspaper the adverts would be an insult to voters .
" the 30-second political commercial has been the standard in america for years , yet voter turnout there is even lower than it was here in june . "
roger gale , conservative mp for north thanet , said the idea represented the triumph of " spin and presentation over political substance " .
no position " the advantage of having longer party political broadcasts is that it forces politicians to offer some information about the issues and what they intend to do , " added mr gale .
a labour party spokesman said the party would be prepared to " look at a number of options " .
" the labour party does not have an official position on this but we will be looking at the terms of reference for the review , " he said .
since becoming a mainstay of election campaigning in the 1950s , broadcasts have shrunk from 10-minute epics , with most now rarely exceeding the two minutes 40 second minimum length .
in america , short election adverts are often criticised for adopting shock tactics and over-simplifying issues in an effort to catch the attention of voters with short attention spans .

in the view of the chamber this matter should be ready for trial judge richard may however , presiding at mr milosevic 's second preliminary hearing at the un war crimes tribunal on thursday , judge richard may made it clear he was getting impatient .
judge may said that a date would be set for the trial at the beginning of 2002 .
" in the view of the chamber this matter should be ready for trial .
the indictment was issued over two years ago .
this accused has now been in custody for two months and the matter must be readied for trial . "
the new indictments announced on thursday - over war crimes committed in bosnia and croatia in the first half of the 1990s - are to be completed by 1 october .
they will then be followed within two months by amendments to mr milosevic 's existing indictment over kosovo .
new evidence these amendments follow the recent discovery of mass graves containing bodies of kosovo albanians in serbia .
the post-milosevic leadership in belgrade has also alleged that the former leader ordered the destruction or removal of the remains of victims from kosovo to prevent their use as evidence by the tribunal in the hague .
kosovo came under united nations administration in june 1999 and that immediately made it possible for tribunal investigators to begin gathering evidence there .
by contrast , the tribunal 's staff were banned from serbia until after mr milosevic 's fall from power in october last year .
so for mr milosevic to complain about the length of time involved in preparing an indictment against him is rather unfair - given the fact that he had done his best while he was still in power to obstruct the prosecutors ' work .
the tribunal does not have its own law enforcement agencies , and it relies on the co-operation of individual countries which has ranged from the non-existent - as in the case of serbia under mr milosevic - to the reluctant .
even western governments have at times been cautious about parting with secretly-gathered information if that was likely to endanger their intelligence networks .
slow process all this has slowed down the tribunal 's prosecution system .
but its rules of fairness act as another delaying mechanism .
a defendant and his legal team are entitled to a minimum of three and half months to defend their case - and in practice much longer .
in other words , if the kosovo indictment is amended in november , mr milosevic 's trial could hardly get underway before march .
but the delay is likely to be much longer because the cases relating to bosnia and croatia are far less advanced than the case relating to kosovo .
however , the overlap between these conflicts - with regard to their origins , the methods used as well as the cast of characters involved in them - means that it makes a lot of sense to hold one trial , rather than two -lrb- or three -rrb- .
if all charges are heard together , ms del ponte has said it will be at least a year before the trial can open .

some 4,500 of the job losses were likely to be take place outside japan , the firm said .
the cuts , which amount to more than 4 % of hitachi 's staff , will all be made before march next year .
the company also warned that it expected to make a 140bn yen -lrb- £ 810m ; $ 1.2bn -rrb- loss for the full year to march , rather than the 90bn yen profit it had previously predicted .
the news saw hitachi shares fall at one point by as much as 5.5 % to 962 yen .

casio cuts its forecast for group net profit in the year to march 2002 by 80 % , from 7bn yen to 1.5bn yen .
sales , it said , would probably slow by 4.4 % to 430bn yen , as spending on electronic devices continued to slide .
" with the world economy falling into a grave slowdown ... we have to lower our profit forecasts due to this difficult environment , " the company said in a statement .
sanyo said profits were likely to slide to 122bn yen for the year , down from a previous forecast of 150bn yen .

hitachi said it was reducing its planned capital spending in the troubled semiconductor sector to 60bn yen -lrb- £ 344m ; $ 502m -rrb- from the original 140bn yen .
hitachi will post group restructuring costs of 80bn yen in this business year .
more follow meanwhile , casio and sanyo joined the chorus of gloom as both firms warned that profits would be much lower than expected .
casio cuts its forecast for group net profit in the year to march 2002 by 80 % , from 7bn yen to 1.5bn yen .
sales , it said , would probably slow by 4.4 % to 430bn yen , as spending on electronic devices continued to slide .
" with the world economy falling into a grave slowdown ... we have to lower our profit forecasts due to this difficult environment , " the company said in a statement .
sanyo said profits were likely to slide to 122bn yen for the year , down from a previous forecast of 150bn yen . watch / listen on this story peter morgan , hsbc in tokyo " there has been a greater tendancy for the japanese to cut back on domestic employment " keisuke tsumoto , schroders investment management " it companies are drastically changing their restructuring plans " profits plunge in 2001 intel profits slide yahoo losses linger microsoft concerns motorola slashes jobs infineon chip slump dell 's price war ericsson shock unisys profits halve sony 's heavy losses fujitsu slides into red compaq losses mount nokia sales fall ibm rare success ad slump hits aol bruised apple philips ' hefty losses palm sales halved lucent losses widen cisco slumps analysis mobile phone saturation global pc downturn battle of the handhelds bill gates talks it up silicon valley survival marconi 's wrong turning stock option revival consolidation hopes few signs of recovery see also : 31 aug 01 -pipe- business japanese prices spiral downwards 27 aug 01 -pipe- business toshiba cuts 18,800 jobs 27 aug 01 -pipe- business japan ' aid ' for unemployed ? 26 aug 01 -pipe- business hitachi ' joins job cutting spree ' 25 aug 01 -pipe- business toshiba ' to axe 20,000 jobs ' 20 aug 01 -pipe- business fujitsu to cut 16,400 jobs 27 jul 01 -pipe- business fujitsu and nec profits slide 27 jul 01 -pipe- scotland nec confirms job cuts 26 jul 01 -pipe- business job cuts top 50,000 11 jul 01 -pipe- business japan 's economy falters 20 feb 01 -pipe- business tech slump spreads to japan internet links : sanyo casio hitachi the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

a study indicated that women who were very anxious in the last three months of pregnancy had children with more behavioural problems .
those who had boys were twice as likely to have a child who showed problems with hyperactivity and inattention by the age of four .
nine out of 10 of the children even of the most anxious mothers are still perfectly ok professor vivette glover the association between anxiety and behavioural problems in girls was also increased .
lead researcher professor vivette glover , of imperial college , london , told the bbc the link only applied to women who had extreme anxiety , and reported feeling frequently " panicky " or " scared " .
and she said the research should not make mothers even more anxious .
" antenatal anxiety leads to the risk of hyperactivity increasing from one in 20 to one in 10 .
" so nine out of 10 of the children even of the most anxious mothers are still perfectly ok .
" it is also important to note that mood swings are common in pregnancy and that most mums-to-be will have times when they are worried . "
relaxation professor glover said children 's behaviour was usually attributed to either genes or parenting .
but she said this research suggested there was a chemical element as well .
" if the mother is very anxious this changes her chemistry , her hormonal levels .
" we know some of these hormones , for example cortisol , can cross the placenta and it may well affect the development of the baby 's brain in the womb . "
professor glover said she wanted to do more research into how women could best tackle any anxiety they may have .
but for now , she said , every pregnant woman should take time to rest and relax .
" if you 're feeling very anxious , take time out , " she said .
" especially talk to people - talk to a friend , talk to your gp , try and do something that you feel relaxes yourself , sit with your feet up , listen to music . "
the findings came from a survey of more than 7,000 mothers-to-be .
if you 're feeling very anxious , take time out ... sit with your feet up , listen to music professor vivette glover each woman surveyed completed questionnaires designed to measure her level of anxiety at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy .
women were identified as anxious if they scored in the top 15 % of respondents .
their children were assessed for behavioural and emotional problems just before their fourth birthday .
researchers focused in particular on women who were anxious during their pregnancy , but whose levels of anxiety fell after delivery .
this was to see how the baby 's behaviour was affected by antenatal anxiety rather than their mother 's mood during their early years .
the research was co-ordinated by tommy 's , the baby charity .
it is released on the eve of national pregnancy week .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- advice before you go it alone categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 31 august , 2001 , 06:57 gmt 07:57 uk advice before you go it alone setting up a small business requires more than determination this is the fourth part of bbc news online 's " kick-start your career " guide by bbc news online 's personal finance reporter sarah toyne small businesses account for 99 % of the 3.7 million businesses in the uk .
but recent figures suggest that fears of a recession may be putting people off .
according to a recent survey by abbey national , only one in 50 people in the uk has taken the plunge into self-employment over the past year .
this reluctance by people to set up on their own is hardly surprising .
hundreds of thousands of rural business owners are having a torrid time due to foot-and-mouth disease , and the manufacturing sector has been crippled by the strength of the pound .
but there are contradictory reports .
geraldine boardman is chief executive of trafford business venture , a local enterprise agency in manchester , which helps people start businesses .
ms boardman says that the prospect of a recession is not deterring people from going it alone .
she says : " we are seeing a lot of people coming out of employment to start businesses - and not as a last resort . "
in fact , setting up a business during a downturn or recession may even work in your favour .
bucking the trend personal finance public relations firm lansons was founded in 1989 at the height of the last recession , but now employs 65 people and has an annual fee income of £ 5m .
tony langham , co-founder , says that there can be advantages of setting up a company in a recession .
mr langham says : " people are looking around for cheaper options for the work they do - you might be able to find cheaper office space next year . "
more than a good idea ?
" my main tip is to do something you are passionate about ... it all starts from believing in something you do , " says mr langham .
but giving up a good job and taking the plunge into self-employment can be risky , though .
experts advise anyone to think carefully and seek advice before they take drastic action .
and setting up on your own is not just about determination , perseverance , a thick skin and a willingness to be your own boss .
tony langham set up pr firm lansons during the last recession ms boardman says that although these qualities are essential , you also need a clear business plan , knowledge of your market and willingness to take advice .
" you must carry out detailed market research , including the level of demand , and how your idea differs from competition , " she says .
but it is a business plan that is the most important factor .
she says : " if someone 's plan is not right , with the best will in the world , they will not get support - it is the key . "
plan ahead less than two thirds of businesses prepare plans prior to starting up , but it is not only important when you set up .
according to research by shell livewire , companies with a regular business plan had an average profit margin of 54 % , compared with only 35 % for those that did not .
mike rogers , managing director of small business and start-ups at barclays says : " it is vital to assess the situation and make a positive decision .
there is nothing wrong with changing the original plan but not acknowledging the change of direction is a mistake . "
need good advice experts advise anyone to get proper advice before they quit their job and set up on their own .
the government launched a small business service -lrb- sbs -rrb- in april 2000 to help small firms .
through its business links network , you can obtain information , advice and access to experts on all issues relating to running your own business , planning , finance , regulation management and other queries .
the federation of small business represents self-employed people , and has a " be your own boss " pack .
most high street banks are falling over themselves for small business custom and as a consequence have set up an array of business advisory services .
for example , barclays offers advice and fact sheets on writing business plans , while natwest offers a boss -lrb- business one stop shop -rrb- adviser on running a business .
mike warburton , senior partner at accountants grant thornton you may also be able to get help through your regional development agency , the learning and skills council as well as through your local chamber of commerce .
there are about 60 different local chambers of commerce in 100 locations around the uk and it costs £ 80-plus a year to be a member .
malik thahid of the british chambers of commerce says that a local chamber of commerce can be invaluable to a new start up .
he says : " the classic service a local chamber of commerce can offer is vital networking for a small business start-up when they are a new company and are trying to build sales leads .
" they run events and get the whole community involved - people swap business cards and build partnerships . "
other considerations mike warburton , a senior partner at grant thornton , an accountant , usually advises people to " moonlight " before setting up on their own , as long as the type of work they do does not conflict with their day job .
mr warburton says : " this way you are not going into a ' blank ' situation - you have some business lined up .
it can take a couple of years to build up a customer base . "
he also warns people to remember that a major part of running a business is being prepared to take control of financial affairs , such as keeping proper records .

the un high commissioner for refugees is seeking an urgent meeting with the government to discuss why the families , who arrived in pakistan earlier this month , were sent back without being screened .
the decision to deport afghan families is unfortunate and regrettable ... it is a clear breach of the 2 august agreement yusuf hasan unhcr spokesman more than 60,000 afghans are being interviewed by unhcr and pakistan officials in the makeshift jalozai camp near the northern city of peshawar , to verify whether they deserve refugee status .
pakistan says most of the newly arrived afghans do not deserve refugee status and should be sent back , but the authorities had pledged not to deport anyone from the two camps before they were screened .
the deported families were among nearly 1,000 families who came to jalozai during the past few months from northern afghanistan .
' breach of agreement ' the un has described pakistan 's decision to deport the families as incomprehensible .
" the decision to deport afghan families is unfortunate and regrettable , " yusuf hasan , a unhcr spokesman in islamabad , said .
" it is a clear breach of the 2 august agreement , " he said .
local people said that , on tuesday , pakistani officials told the 28 refugee families that they were being taken to another site to be interviewed .
instead , they were put on government trucks and taken to the afghan border , where they were handed over to the taleban militia .
screening process the bbc 's pakistan correspondent , susannah price , says the unhcr has worked hard to try to convince the afghan refugees that the screening process is for their own good .
the refugees are interviewed at length , and anyone who faces persecution or comes from areas where there is fighting or drought is to be granted temporary permission to stay .
refugees who fail the screening , including those who are seen as economic migrants , are to be deported by the government .
the two refugee camps will be closed once the screening ends .
about 14,000 families have signed up for the process , while others have decided to return home with help from unhcr or to move elsewhere in pakistan .
more than two million afghan refugees are already living in pakistan , and at least 150,000 are currently seeking refugee status .
pakistan worries that once un funding stops , it will be left with the unrealistic burden of feeding and clothing the new refugees .

the two-year-old company is axing the journey due to poor take-up , leaving cork in ireland its only destination .
direct flights to manchester will be stopped operators believed they could sustain a twice-daily trip to manchester , for people to catch connecting flights from the city .
but they have been disappointed by the level of interest .
air wales launched in november 1999 .
while 15 other airlines flew from cardiff international airport , it was the only indigenous welsh airline .
the company is based at cardiff international airport and is directed by captain john howard evans .
in march 2001 , air wales announced it was considering a route from cardiff to new york 's newark international airport .
but , while some of the popular budget airlines do not fly from cardiff , the company has found the going tough .
air wales is still looking into transatlantic flights there have not been enough takers of the service to the north of england to sustain the flight .
air wales 's other main route from cardiff to cork has proved to be much more profitable and is set to continue .
on the back of its success - it carried 12,000 passengers in the first six months - the company has looked at flying to other uk airports , including belfast , stansted and luton .
and there are hopes to bring haverfordwest and caernarfon on board as satellite airports to create a pan-wales air service .
new company air wales took over where the former cambrian airways left off 30 years ago .
cambrian had used viscount aircraft to fly from cardiff to places like jersey and malaga back in the 1960s .
cambrian disappeared when it merged into british airways more than 30 years ago and wales was without a national airline until air wales stepped up .
the company uses 19-seat fairchild dornier 228 aircraft and hoped to double its fleet to four this summer .

such systems are expected to be extremely rare .
it will give us insights we ca n't get from other types of lenses dr david rusin , university of pennsylvania it is a unique configuration , produced by the gravitational effect of three galaxies along the line of sight between the more-distant galaxy and earth .
" this is the first gravitational lens with more than four images of the background object that is produced by a small group of galaxies rather than a large cluster of galaxies , " said dr david rusin , of the university of pennsylvania , us .
gravitational lensing - first predicted by albert einstein - is a neat trick that allows scientists to probe distant parts of the universe in greater detail than would normally be possible -lrb- see box -rrb- .
astronomers say that the six-way cosmic lens will reveal new information about how galaxies interact with each other .
' interesting case ' the gravitational lens , called class b1359 + 154 , consists of a galaxy more than 11 billion light-years away in the constellation bootes .
it is positioned behind a trio of galaxies more than seven billion light-years away .
it was found using the very long baseline array -lrb- vlba -rrb- radio telescope in the us and the hubble space telescope -lrb- hst -rrb- in orbit .
view from a ground-based telescope the more-distant galaxy shows signs that it contains a massive black hole at its core and also has regions in which new stars are forming .
the gravity of the intervening galaxies has caused the light and radio waves from the single , more distant galaxy to be deflected to form six images as seen from earth .
four of these images appear outside the triangle formed by the three intermediate galaxies and two appear inside it .
" this lens system is a very interesting case to study because it is more complicated than lenses produced by single galaxies , and yet simpler than lenses produced by clusters of numerous galaxies , " said chris kochanek , of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics , us .
" when we understand this system , we will have a much clearer picture of how galaxies are changed by being part of a bigger cluster of galaxies , " he added .
multi-wavelength survey b1359 + 154 was discovered in 1999 by the cosmic lens all-sky survey , an international collaboration of astronomers using radio telescopes to search the sky for gravitational lenses .
images made by the very large array -lrb- vla -rrb- in new mexico and by britain 's jodrell bank radio telescopes showed six objects suspected of being gravitational-lens images , but the results were inconclusive .
gravitational lensing when foreground objects are so massive they can bend the light from more distant galaxies passing by them , much as an optical lens bends light to form an image on a photographic plate .
the process magnifies , brightens and distorts images of the distant galaxies , and acts like a powerful " zoom lens " for viewing regions of the cosmos that are so far away they could not normally be observed with the largest available telescopes rusin and his team used the vlba and hst in 1999 and 2000 to make more detailed studies of b1359 + 154 .
the new data convinced the astronomers that it consists of six lensed images of a single background galaxy .
" this is a great example of modern , multi-wavelength astronomy , said rusin .
" we need the radio telescopes to detect the gravitational lenses in the first place , then we need the visible-light information from hubble to show us additional detail about the structure of the system . "
armed with the combined vlba and hst data about the positions and brightnesses of the six images of the background galaxy as well as the positions of the three intermediate galaxies , the astronomers carried out computer simulations to show how the gravitation of the three galaxies could produce the lens effect .
they were able to design a computer model of the system that produced the six images seen in b1359 + 154 .
" the next big step is to use hst to see the pattern of rings produced by the galaxy surrounding the black hole .
we already see hints of them , but with the upgrades to hst in the next servicing mission we should be able to trace it completely , " kochanek said .

the scottish executive announced in march that £ 25m would be available for the decommissioning of fishing boats in a bid to reduce the size of scottish fleets and preserve dwindling white fish stocks in the north sea .
applications to the fund , which is being administered by the executive 's environment and rural affairs department , will be taken from friday until 31 october this year .
some scottish skippers have said that the offer only goes part of the way to addressing the problem .

ms brankin said : " i know scottish fishermen have been eagerly awaiting the opening of the decommissioning scheme .
" the scottish executive has been working in consultation with the scottish fishing industry to implement the scheme as quickly as possible .
" i believe the £ 25m package is a practical step that will provide benefits in the long term , helping to ensure an economically viable fishing industry . "
fishermen will be urged to submit competitive bids to the fund on the requirement that they decommission their vessel and surrender its licence .

the eu imposed new restrictions earlier this year which effectively prohibited scottish vessels from fishing in certain areas for a 10-week period .
this sparked a protest from peterhead fishermen , who undertook a voluntary tie-up rather than catch undersized fish .
the deal sparked initial protests their efforts to persuade the scottish executive to offer compensation led to a series of protests near the parliament .

the scheme was formally announced by ms brankin in the scottish parliament on 8 march but it soon encountered difficulty .
a majority of msps voted against it in favour of an immediate compensation scheme but this was overturned on a second vote .
the fishing vessels -lrb- decommissioning -rrb- -lrb- scotland -rrb- scheme 2001 was eventually laid before parliament on 28 june and msps are expected to formally approve it after the summer recess .

the fish that are accumulated by that should then be spread back among the boats that are left at sea . "

hamish morrison of the scottish fishermen 's federation said : " it is about having too many production units and chronic unprofitability .
" as with any other industry , what you have to do is reduce the number of production units so that the ones that remain can achieve profitability .
" we will still be catching the same amount of fish albeit with fewer vessels . " watch / listen on this story fisheries minister rhona brankin " the scheme is intended to take out 20 % of the white fish sector , whcih has been experiencing difficulties . "
