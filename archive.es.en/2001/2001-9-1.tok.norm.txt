the new figures revise forecasts which originally predicted growth in the argentine economy .
despite the new figures , economy minister domingo cavallo , has said the government will maintain its zero deficit spending policy .
the new figures are not encouraging for argentina .
the government had budgeted for growth in gross domestic product of around 2 % this year .
zero deficit with that in mind , mr cavallo , said he could maintain a zero deficit budget , spending only as much as the government takes in taxes .
but now gdp is predicted to fall by 1.4 % .
that means less taxes and less spending at a time when the economy desperately needs some new cash to kick it back into life .
the new figures also make it increasingly difficult for argentina to pay its debts .
the interest bill alone accounts for 20 % of the budget and that is expected to climb to 25 % in 2002 .
default the key question for investors now is whether argentina will default or restructure its debts .
in a news conference , domingo cavallo insisted he will do neither and that he can turn the economy around .
but that may take more time than the country has .
there is already growing social unrest over state wage and pension cuts of 13 % - unions have warned that they will not tolerate a peso more in cuts .

the pact was reached at a meeting hosted by the guatemalan president , alfonso portillo , in guatemala city .
the five heads of state from nicaragua , el salvador , honduras , costa rica and guatemala also discussed the issue of unresolved border disputes in the region .
the guatemalan president said that the agreement was an important step towards consolidating democracy and law in the region .
non-aggression he did not specify the details of the pact , but said that any problematic issues between the five countries would be dealt with in the international courts and not by acts of aggression .
the agreement comes at a time of high diplomatic tension in the region .
two weeks ago honduras expelled two diplomats from neighbouring el salvador , accusing them of spying .
soon afterwards , a military spokesman in nicaragua created a further diplomatic scare , accusing honduras of planning a surprise attack on nicaragua .
the driving force behind these tensions lies in the long-running dispute over territorial and fishing rights in the gulf of fonseca , a pacific inlet shared by the three countries .
violence it was in part this border dispute that led to a brief but bloody conflict between el salvador and honduras in 1969 in which 6,000 people died .
the agreement reached in guatemala city will go some way to ensuring that in the future the outstanding border controversies between the central american nations will not spill over into violence .

the five heads of state from nicaragua , el salvador , honduras , costa rica and guatemala also discussed the issue of unresolved border disputes in the region .
the guatemalan president said that the agreement was an important step towards consolidating democracy and law in the region .
non-aggression he did not specify the details of the pact , but said that any problematic issues between the five countries would be dealt with in the international courts and not by acts of aggression .
the guatemalan president is pushing for closer regional co-operation the agreement comes at a time of high diplomatic tension in the region .
two weeks ago honduras expelled two diplomats from neighbouring el salvador , accusing them of spying .
soon afterwards , a military spokesman in nicaragua created a further diplomatic scare , accusing honduras of planning a surprise attack on nicaragua .
the driving force behind these tensions lies in the long-running dispute over territorial and fishing rights in the gulf of fonseca , a pacific inlet shared by the three countries .
violence it was in part this border dispute that led to a brief but bloody conflict between el salvador and honduras in 1969 in which 6,000 people died .
the agreement reached in guatemala city will go some way to ensuring that in the future the outstanding border controversies between the central american nations will not spill over into violence .

low pay , low status and low morale combine to create unique stresses and strains .
chris jones of the bbc 's news profiles unit looks at the plight of the pedagogue .
picture , if you will , the cherubic faces of the five and six-year-olds , eager for the first words of the new teacher who can lead them on a voyage of discovery that will open new horizons .
it could happen .
millions of people of a certain generation remember that teacher who made them feel special , saw their potential and nurtured it .
such memories were perceived and tapped by the department for education in a series of television recruitment messages .
rachel turffrey embarking on her new career rachel turffrey , of croxley green , hertfordshire , naturally hopes she can become one of that significant group of teachers , as she embarks on her profession .
" it 's something i 've always wanted to do " , she says .
rachel , who is 23 , will be miss to the red class of 26 primary schoolchildren .
but whilst she approaches her first day with a fair amount of idealism , she has already experienced some of the problems of the uk education system , 2001 .
rachel spent three weeks preparing her classroom , making it cleaner and brighter and sorting out broken equipment .
she also spent more than £ 100 of her own money replacing school books which , in some cases , were 30 years old .
although the school would probably have paid for them , rachel wanted to bypass any red tape and ensure she had them for the start of term .
teaching practice proved an eye-opener , too , as she got a taste of the problems encountered by many inner-city teachers every day ; dealing with a host of practical difficulties ranging from multi-culturalism to indiscipline .
so in order to understand .
this is one of the reasons why an estimated 40 % of trainee teachers never enter the profession .
more than half of those who make it to the classroom leave within five years , and , according to indications from a survey of secondary school heads , one in five new teachers fall below the desirable standard .
poor pay , low status , stress , bureaucracy and pupil misbehaviour are among the other reasons why the national union of teachers says the profession is becoming " unsustainable " .
pay is a problem most acutely felt in the south-east of england , where property prices are at their highest .
teacher alison mcculloch 's finances , for example , have been transformed by her moving from a nursery class at rickmansworth in hertfordshire , where a one-bedroom flat costs £ 80,000 , to a job in newcastle , where she is buying a two-bedroom house for £ 59,000 .
" up here , i feel quite well off , " she says .
now that 's very well done the government has resorted to emergency financial measures in an attempt to fill school vacancies , with £ 6,000-a-year bursaries to encourage graduates into training , plus £ 4,000 " golden hellos " if they become teachers .
the education secretary , estelle morris , says she is now planning to limit the powers of independent appeals panels to reinstate excluded pupils .
but teachers ' unions feel progress towards improving the working life of teachers faced with violent and disruptive pupils has moved at a snail 's pace .
the chief inspector of schools , mike tomlinson , who says the teacher shortage in england is the worst for nearly 40 years , believes ms morris 's priority should be to reduce the bureaucratic demands on teachers .
it was the increasing burden of paperwork and relentless new initiatives that led to mark annison 's premature retirement through stress from his deputy headship at a primary school six years ago .
" the national curriculum is very important , but it was n't thought through properly , " he says .
" if a rocket ship from mars landed in the playground , such is the rigidity of the curriculum that we 'd still have to carry on with the prescribed lessons " .
jumping for a level joy now , as a facilities assistant at bt cellnet , his life is more relaxed , but it still troubles him that , in a system of league tables and rigorous targets , pupils are being denied the benefit of a teacher 's instinct and imagination .
it is a system likened by its critics to the approach of dickens ' thomas gradgrind of hard times : " with a rule and a pair of scales ... ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature . "
rachel turffrey is aware that the challenges she faces are " daunting " .
but she has a bubbly personality and a firm resolve .
she hopes her enthusiasm will remain undimmed , so by the time her new class become parents , they and others of their generation will look back on their early school days with gratitude .

the river ythan in aberdeenshire contains important salmon stock and the nearby forvie nature reserve has the largest breeding eider population in britain .
but environmental groups fear that pollution is eroding the banks of the river and endangering its ecosystem .
the eu confirmed that the project was one of 103 environmental schemes chosen to share a £ 36m fund although it did not say how much would be given .
alison mcinness : " the river is important " use of nitrogen fertilisers and organic manures , including sewage sludge , have been blamed for rising pollution levels on the river .
in addition to the salmon and eider population the ythan also supports an important tern colony , large numbers of wading birds and six sites of special scientific interest -lrb- ssi -rrb- .
anti-pollution campaigners want to see the eu money to reduce pollution levels by restoring parts of the river , stopping further erosion of banks and providing educational seminars for local people .
tamsin morris , development officer with the formartine partnership , which was set up to attract european funding , said she did not know how much money would be given .
" hopefully , we will know by the middle of next week .
it is vulnerable , as any river would be .
' heavily developed ' " there are just more farmers round this river than most other rivers .
it is quite an active area and that is particularly why the river ythan has the problems it has , " she said .
alison mcinnes , convener of aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure services committee , said : " the issue for the river is that it is heavily developed around its banks and more than 95 % is farm .
" the river is important because it is internationally designated in terms of the ec birds directive and we also have a number of sssis along the river .
" the river is the heart of the community so it is important on a lot of different levels . "

the river ythan in aberdeenshire contains important salmon stock and the nearby forvie nature reserve has the largest breeding eider population in britain .
but environmental groups fear that pollution is eroding the banks of the river and endangering its ecosystem .
the eu confirmed that the project was one of 103 environmental schemes chosen to share a £ 36m fund although it did not say how much would be given .
use of nitrogen fertilisers and organic manures , including sewage sludge , have been blamed for rising pollution levels on the river .
in addition to the salmon and eider population the ythan also supports an important tern colony , large numbers of wading birds and six sites of special scientific interest -lrb- ssi -rrb- .
anti-pollution campaigners want to see the eu money to reduce pollution levels by restoring parts of the river , stopping further erosion of banks and providing educational seminars for local people .
tamsin morris , development officer with the formartine partnership , which was set up to attract european funding , said she did not know how much money would be given .
" hopefully , we will know by the middle of next week .
it is vulnerable , as any river would be .
' heavily developed ' " there are just more farmers round this river than most other rivers .
it is quite an active area and that is particularly why the river ythan has the problems it has , " she said .
alison mcinnes , convener of aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure services committee , said : " the issue for the river is that it is heavily developed around its banks and more than 95 % is farm .
" the river is important because it is internationally designated in terms of the ec birds directive and we also have a number of sssis along the river .
" the river is the heart of the community so it is important on a lot of different levels . "
