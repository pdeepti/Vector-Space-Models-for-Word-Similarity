whether it is too much pasta , the channel tunnel rail link or too much chilli , who knows ?
we are becoming more " passionate " .
more than half of people now complain all or most of the time if they are unhappy with a product - an increase of 12 % in a year .
complaining has become so prevalent , that two thirds of people now believe that we are better at it than before .
but it is age over youth and inexperience , which increases the chances of making a complaint according to this year 's national complaints culture survey -lrb- nccs -rrb- .
two thirds of those over 50 complain all or most of the time if they are dissatisfied , while the under 21s are the least likely to complain .
regional divide the north of england is a complaints " hotspot " , where nearly two out of three people say that they make complaints all or most of the time .
who complains most ?
north : 65 % east midlands : 55 % north west : 53 % east anglia : 50 % south east : 49 % yorks and humberside : 48 % scotland : 46 % west midlands : 45 % south west ; 45 % greater london : 45 % northern ireland : 33 % wales : 29 % while only one in three people complain regularly in scotland , northern ireland and wales .
new technology is also aiding the complaining " bug " .
with more companies offering customer service via e-mail , complaints expressed in this way have risen by 350 % this year .
real benefits companies should take note of the findings - nearly all customers would recommend a company to their friends if a complaint had been resolved efficiently .
however , four out of five customers would spread the word if a complaint had been handled badly .
but not many companies seem to be listening to this customer service point .
despite the rise in complaints , only one in four employees feel qualified to deal with them .
while only one in three customer-facing staff are actually trained to deal with angry customers .
