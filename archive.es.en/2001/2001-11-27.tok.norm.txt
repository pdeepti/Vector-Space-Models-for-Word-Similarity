the council for the protection of rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- made the appeal to chancellor gordon brown as he made the last preparations for his pre-budget statement .
more must be done to weed out damaging farming techniques and unnecessary road projects , as well as stamping out litter and graffiti , says the cpre .
the organisation , which is running a london conference on tuesday , wants action across whitehall to match attempts by the treasury to promote greener policies .
grinding concerns the council 's paul hamblin , said mr brown 's pre-budget statement should react to the kind of environmental concerns that were grinding people down .
" billions of pounds of public funds will be allocated in the spending review , " he said .
" making sure it enhances rather than damages the countryside will be key to improving people 's quality of life . "
the government has already spoken about turning from subsidising production to rewarding wildlife management but the cpre wants an immediate switch .
the organisation also wants the government 's 10-year transport plan to take a new direction so it tackles traffic , which it says is predicted will rise by 17 % between 2000 and 2010 .
most of the £ 60bn earmarked for roads should instead be spent on public transport , says the cpre .
funds of quiet lanes there should be more funds too for quiet lanes , town and village plans and measures to stamp out litter and graffiti .
quarrying is another concern raised earlier this month by the cpre .
the council fears the chancellor might introduce tax rebates for quarrying operators .
david young , the cpre 's natural resources campaigner , said : " if the government really wants to protect the countryside and communities from quarrying it should leave well alone . "

the withdrawal comes on the day that two american envoys are meeting the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , to try to arrange a ceasefire between the israelis and palestinians .
gideon meir , spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , said the withdrawal was a gesture of goodwill as the talks with the us envoys started .
the us officials - former general anthony zinni , and assistant secretary of state , william burns - plan to stay in the region until a truce has been achieved .
but a statement from mr sharon 's office repeated that he wanted to see a week without violence before a peace plan could be implemented , a condition that palestinian officials say means that any peace moves are doomed to fail .
retribution israeli troops began their incursions into the six west bank palestinian towns on 18 october following the assassination of israeli tourism minister rehavam zeevi by the popular front for the liberation of palestine .
they had remained inside jenin , citing security threats , after their withdrawal from the other five towns - tulkarm , qalqilya , ramallah , bethlehem and beit jala .
the two us envoys arrived only hours after a palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up on the border between israel and the gaza strip , slightly injuring two israeli border guards .
the palestinian militant group hamas said it carried out the attack in revenge for the israeli killing of a hamas leader , mahmud abu hanoud , on friday .
spiralling violence it was the latest incident in a spate of violence sparked by friday 's killing of mr hanoud in a missile attack by an israeli helicopter gunship .
on saturday , an israeli soldier was killed in a mortar attack in the gaza strip and on sunday a 14-year-old palestinian boy was shot by israeli soldiers during a hamas protest outside the west bank town of bethlehem .
he died later .
at least three other palestinians were wounded when israeli helicopters attacked targets across the gaza strip in response to saturday 's mortar attack .
in another development , israeli security services said they had arrested more than 15 palestinians in connection with an alleged iraqi-backed " terrorism ring " in the west bank towns of ramallah and jenin .
timetable sought the envoys ' mission follows last week 's speech by the us secretary of state , colin powell , in which he spelled out washington 's vision for the middle east .
bbc middle east correspondent barbara plett says they will be greeted by a stack of reports documenting the israeli view that the palestinian authority is involved in the violence .
israel has appointed a right-wing reservist general , meir dagan , as head of its negotiating team .
for their part , the palestinians are looking for a clear timetable leading to changes on the ground , such as a pullback of israeli troops and an end to military operations that provoke revenge attacks .
the envoys are expected to press both sides to implement the terms of a ceasefire negotiated five months ago by us central intelligence agency director george tenet which never took hold .
ceasefire plan mr tenet 's plan called on israel to stop military incursions into palestinian towns , to stop killing suspected militants and to lift travel restrictions between palestinian-controlled areas .
he called on the palestinians to stop attacks on israel , to take action against militant groups and to collect illegal firearms .
mr sharon , due to visit washington later this week , said the us mission would put mr arafat 's intentions to the test and insisted that israel would try to reach a ceasefire .
the bbc 's correspondent says some analysts believe mr sharon 's political future will be threatened if the violence ends .
his coalition government might split over how to approach peace talks .
nearly 1,000 people , most of them palestinians , have been killed since the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation began in the west bank and gaza strip in september 2000 , shortly after peace talks stalled .

the drug could provide an alternative to current treatments , which include a risky bone marrow transplant operation and powerful chemotherapy .
glivec , which works by precisely targeting the molecules thought to cause the cancer , has produced highly promising results in clinical trials on over 7,500 patients world-wide .
the drug normalised the blood count in over 90 % of patients , and reduced leukaemia cells in the bone marrow .
glivec has transformed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia professor john goldman over 90 % were free of the disease 12 months later , with more than 50 % showing complete or near complete disappearance of an abnormal gene that triggers the development of the disease .
the drug also has none of the severe side effects associated with current chemotherapy drugs used to treat the condition .
this is because it only targets the cancer cells , and leaves healthy cells unaffected .
doctors involved a trial of the drug in scotland said the results were the most exciting and encouraging they had ever seen .
the 77 patients involved in the tests at glasgow royal infirmay this year reported very few side-effects from glivec .
it is thought the drug may also be effective in treating other forms of cancer .
professor john goldman , of hammersmith hospital , london , said : " glivec has transformed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia .
" up to now all the usual therapy for leukaemia has basically involved blunderbuss therapy , in other words killing all cells and hoping that you kill more leukaemia cells than normal cells .
" the elegance of glivec is that it goes precisely for leukaemia cells , almost entirely sparing the normal cells .
" this is the first example of a molecularly targeted therapy that really does work . "
patient sandy craine , from london , is one of the patients who has been successfully treated with glivec .
she takes six pills a day just after dinner .
she was initially told by doctors that she would die within a year without a bone marrow transplant .
but her white cell count normalised very quickly after starting treatment with glivec .
" i would say i am a very happy person now .
i 'm well , i 'm normal , i 'm like everybody else .
" i had a threat of death hanging over my head , i do n't have that anymore .
i feel better than i have for years . "
common form chronic myeloid leukaemia is one of the four most common types of leukaemia .
it affects around 800 people in the uk each year .
the only potential for cure is a bone marrow transplant , a high-risk procedure for which only 20 % of patients are eligible .
the other treatment option is chemotherapy .
cml can strike at any age , but mainly affects the 40-60 year age group .
it has three phases : the chronic , lasting up to four years ; the accelerated , lasting up to nine months ; and the final , often fatal blast crisis phase , lasting up to six months .
developed by novartis oncology , glivec is designed to target an abnormal piece of genetic material in the bone marrow cells - the philadelphia chromosome .
the philadelphia chromosome is created by an exchange of genetic material between two normal chromosomes , 9 and 22 .
it contains a fused gene which produces a protein that triggers an accelerated production of white blood cells , and a decrease in cell deaths .
glivec prevents this disruption by binding to a protein that plays a crucial part in the process .
the department of health has indicated that patients who have started to take glivec as part of the clinical trials should be allowed to continue to receive the drug on the nhs .
a decision on its wider availability will be taken next year by the national institute for clinical excellence .

the proposed £ 500m project is being backed by british energy and multinational amec .
it could lead to hundreds of wind turbines being sited near stornoway .
uk energy minster brian wilson will lead a delegation to the area next week to discuss the proposals with members of the western isles council and landowners , the stornoway trust .
mr wilson said the discussions had been " going on quietly for months " .

a new law proposed by the scottish executive would allow ceremonies to take place in a range of different venues .
at present , civil weddings can only be held at one of scotland 's 247 registry offices - while those who choose a religious marriage have been able to decide on an unusual location for a number of years .
registrars say trains should not be moving the registrars say they have no objection in principle to the marriage -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill .
however , in evidence to the scottish parliament they are expected to voice concerns at the prospect of having to perform ceremonies in certain locations .
under the new law , couples will be able to tie the knot at their favourite hotel or beauty spot , or in a marquee in a back garden .
registrars welcome the new law , but have reservations about performing ceremonies on mountain tops - and say ships and trains will have to be stationary .
they also warn that the wedding venues - which will need licences - should be seemly and dignified , not tawdry or frivolous .
member 's bill under the proposals , local councils will have the power to approve specific sites as venues for civil marriages - as long as they preserve the dignity of the marriage ceremony .
the bill , which is expected to come into effect next summer , was published earlier this month .
the move came after the executive decided to take on a private member 's bill proposed by msp euan robson .
he has said that the proposals would bring many benefits to the people of scotland , while also providing a boost to tourism .
pop star madonna , who married film director guy ritchie in the highlands last year , is among those who have already chosen the country as a wedding destination .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- tesco sales remain strong categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 27 november , 2001 , 07:11 gmt tesco sales remain strong chief executive terry leahy has cut prices the uk 's biggest supermarket chain , tesco , has reported strong sales figure during the last three-and-a-half months .
sales would have grown even sharper if tough price competition had not led to a 1 % fall in prices during the period , tesco said .
" it is a good performance from tesco , " said schroder salomon smith barney analyst david mccarthy .
" although sales growth is slowing , they continue to outperform the competition . "
sales growth group sales rose 12.2 % during the 14-week period until 17 november .
internationally , the group saw a 34 % rise in sales , boosted by its expansion into new markets .
in the uk , sales rose 9.2 % , though this was partly due to the opening of a number of new shops .
sales in the shops it already owned ahead of the quarter rose 6.4 % .
" that is probably better than most analysts had anticipated , " said one analyst .
given the price falls , the sales growth during the third quarter slowed from 7.4 % during the second quarter .
safeway 's sales growth in shops it already owned ahead of the third quarter reached 5.7 % while sainsbury reported a 6 % rise during the three-month period .
slowdown analysts said tesco 's results indicated that the industry 's sales growth during the year had yet to be hard hit by the economic slowdown - but the next few months are expected to be tough for the supermarkets .
" the key message here is that life is getting worse for the sector , but tesco is living with it , " said one analyst .
tesco shares rose 1 % in early trading , though so far this year the stock has slipped 10 % , in part due to the negative outlook for the sector .
" the slowdown -lsb- in the growth of sales -rsb- was expected , and the crunch time will come after christmas , " said mr mccarthy .

sales would have grown even sharper if tough price competition had not led to a 1 % fall in prices during the period , tesco said .
" it is a good performance from tesco , " said schroder salomon smith barney analyst david mccarthy .
" although sales growth is slowing , they continue to outperform the competition . "
sales growth group sales rose 12.2 % during the 14-week period until 17 november .
internationally , the group saw a 34 % rise in sales , boosted by its expansion into new markets .
in the uk , sales rose 9.2 % , though this was partly due to the opening of a number of new shops .
sales in the shops it already owned ahead of the quarter rose 6.4 % .
" that is probably better than most analysts had anticipated , " said one analyst .
given the price falls , the sales growth during the third quarter slowed from 7.4 % during the second quarter .
safeway 's sales growth in shops it already owned ahead of the third quarter reached 5.7 % while sainsbury reported a 6 % rise during the three-month period .
slowdown analysts said tesco 's results indicated that the industry 's sales growth during the year had yet to be hard hit by the economic slowdown - but the next few months are expected to be tough for the supermarkets .
" the key message here is that life is getting worse for the sector , but tesco is living with it , " said one analyst .
tesco shares rose 1 % in early trading , though so far this year the stock has slipped 10 % , in part due to the negative outlook for the sector .
" the slowdown -lsb- in the growth of sales -rsb- was expected , and the crunch time will come after christmas , " said mr mccarthy .
" tesco remains the best-positioned to deal with this . "

with oil prices in freefall , the cartel is trying to persuade non-members to fall in line with its own decision to cut back by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- .
opec apparently believes it can act with impunity ...
under us antitrust statutes , direct purchasers of a product can sue for treble damages from those who engage in illegal conspiracies phil verleger energy economist its own 11 members are reluctant to move if others are willing to step in and pick up the slack .
but these efforts - already running into trouble , thanks to russia 's refusal to contemplate more than token 50,000 bpd production curbs - will prove even more difficult should lawsuits be initiated .
fixing prices according to phil verleger , of pk verleger llc , oil companies doing business in the us should be subject to anti-trust rules in a way that sovereign states are not .
so going for the companies could be a way of keeping prices low - a result seen as vital for the hard-pressed aviation industry , hit by slumping passenger numbers and massive overcapacity .
" opec apparently believes it can act with impunity , " mr verleger told reuters .
" under us antitrust statutes , direct purchasers of a product can sue for treble damages from those who engage in illegal conspiracies . "
legacy of mistrust major oil consumers were displeased with opec for a series of production cuts since 1999 that at one point pushed crude oil prices to more than $ 30 a barrel .
opec has been pushing to keep oil prices in a $ 22-28 collar .
many of its members see the current price - less than $ 19 a barrel - as inadequate .
some opec members are developing countries which rely on oil revenue for much of their foreign exchange .
the massive drop in demand for oil as the world slowdown gathered pace since 11 september means oil prices could collapse without stabilising action , opec secretary general ali rodriguez says .

commercial aircraft trefn engineering depend on airbus and raytheon for its orders .
the company also supplies components to short brothers , who make commercial aircraft in belfast .
the bad news at trefn has been repeated across north wales , with more than 1,000 workers losing their jobs in the past two months at firms including alcoa , burlington toiletries and corning .

the decision comes after months of infighting between ministers and officials , as part of a running fight over thinning japan 's bureaucracy .
the fight has already come close to costing the foreign minister , makiko tanaka , her job .
if the move is successful , it could cut up to 1 trillion yen -lrb- $ 8bn ; £ 5.7bn -rrb- off government spending .
the finance minister , masajuro shiokawa , has already pledged to strip that sum out of next year 's budget .
but that still leaves 156 other state-backed companies - partly because several cabinet members have been fighting their ministries ' corner , resulting in a report earlier this year which vacillated on many of the firms ' prospects .
" we still have a long way to go , " admitted yasuo fukuda , the chief cabinet secretary - although he called the cabinet approval a " breakthrough " .
reform the plan is a key part of mr koizumi 's pledge to rein in public spending , keep borrowing under control by capping new bond issues at 30,000bn yen and getting bank bad debts down to manageable levels within three years .
despite the pain that the long-overdue reforms will cause , the public seems to approve .
mr koizumi 's apparent willingness to bite the bullet after years of procrastination by a succession of charisma-free leaders of his liberal democratic party translates into popularity ratings approaching 80 % .
the agencies concerned are notorious for guzzling public money on huge infrastructure and other projects which often owe more to politicians ' desire to buy favour in their constituencies than to genuine need .
in line for the chop are the japan national oil corporation , the urban development corporation and the housing loan corporation .
and on the privatisation shortlist are the japan highway public corp , the metropolitan expressway public corp , the hanshin expressway public corp and the honshu-shikoku bridge authority .
the jnhc in particular is famed as a home for super-annuated bureaucrats seeking a comfortable semi-retirement .
its debts amount to more than 26,000bn yen after years of building unwanted roads as part of politically-motivated stimulus packages .
the other transport groups are different in scale , but not in style .

a bbc correspondent at the scene says fewer than 10 of the hundreds of taleban originally taken prisoner may still be alive , on the third day of the revolt .
us warplanes launched up to 30 air strikes overnight against the fighters , who were originally detained following their surrender in kunduz over the weekend .
northern alliance fighters have been seen scrambling up the ramparts of the fort in the past few hours .
several vans carrying british and american special forces have arrived to co-ordinate the onslaught .
at one point on monday , an american bomb went astray , killing six northern alliance fighters and seriously injuring five us soldiers .
the hurt men were among a number of american special forces inside the fort who are helping to co-ordinate the response of the northern alliance .
the alliance had detained about 500 non-afghan taleban prisoners in the qala-e-jhangi fortress .
the revolt began on sunday when the prisoners killed some of their guards with guns they had reportedly smuggled into the fort , and seized more weapons .
some reports say they then attempted a mass breakout .
the international committee for the red cross has been trying to visit the fort to assess the situation .
us casualties several hundred northern alliance fighters and taleban prisoners have been killed .
us defence secretary donald rumsfeld said some taleban had managed to escape .
alliance soldiers emerging from the fort have been describing a bloodbath .
the injured us soldiers have been evacuated to uzbekistan , said general richard myers , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff , in washington .
one cia operative is reported to have died .
a journalist who was near mazar-e-sharif during the initial stages of the revolt said american and british special forces went into the fort because they thought an american soldier there had been killed , and another had run out of ammunition .
denial of opportunism abdul wahid , a northern alliance spokesman , denied his group was using the uprising as an opportunity to get rid of unwanted prisoners , and stressed the alliance was aware of its international obligations .
the prisoners are mainly arabs , chechens and pakistanis linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
foreign fighters , who are locally regarded as destabilising elements in the country , have often been beaten or killed when territory has fallen to the northern alliance in the course of the current conflict .
alliance commanders said the remaining prisoners , trapped in a tower , were running out of ammunition and would not last long .

mr misuari led an uprising last week , ahead of a vote to elect a new governor for the autonomous region in muslim mindanao -lrb- armm -rrb- .
more than 100 people died in attacks on army outposts on the nearby island of jolo .
the military , backed by gunships , attacked the complex monday 's vote went ahead amid tight security .

more than 100 jobs are due to go at the company 's corwen plant , after the firm said it would be moving its operations to selby , north yorkshire .
a company spokesman said the corwen workforce would be axed from 130 to 17 .
the announcement brings the job losses in the region to approximately 1,000 in the past two months .
the spokesman said the company , owned by hazlewood foods , had decided it was more cost-effective to transfer production to selby .
job transfer north wales am janet ryder said the news was a " huge blow " to the area .
" its workforce has now fallen prey to owners who have no real concern for the area , " said ms ryder .
" it is all too easy for them to move production elsewhere .
" employees at meridian have seen this coming , but once again first minister rhodri morgan , for all his three jobs , has failed to get to grips with the difficulties facing the north of wales . "
it is hoped that many staff will be able to transfer to the parent company 's new chilled pizza site at deeside .
meridian is seeking a potential buyer for part of the corwen site .
consultations are underway with staff , and it is anticipated the transfer will be completed by the end of february .
established in north wales in 1974 , meridian produces a range of health foods and organic products .
the company 's range of goods includes fruit spreads , fruit juices , pasta and pasta sauces , nut butters , dressings and oils , which the company boasts are free from artificial ingredients and preservatives .
the job losses add to the grim news for workers at companies from the conwy valley to wrexham in the past few weeks .
corning in deeside announced 436 losses , followed by 189 at alcoa , 124 at trefn , 90 at burlington toiletries and 113 at meridian .
