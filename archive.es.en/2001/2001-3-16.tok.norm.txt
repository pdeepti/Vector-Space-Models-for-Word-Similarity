could it be that these patients had a sore throat and they were just unlucky that they ate a sausage or a meat pie that had a lot of bse brain associated with it ?
professor stephen dearmond , ucsf the theory has been put forward by a leading american scientist , professor stephen dearmond , from the university of california at san francisco .
he said it could explain why relatively few people had been struck down with the illness so far and why so many of those who had were under the age of 35 .
british researchers studying vcjd said the theory was plausible but stressed there was no experimental data to support it .
scientists still know very little about why the variant form of creutzfeldt-jacob disease seems to strike some people and not others .
exact route to date , it has killed 94 people in the uk .
another eight are suspected sufferers and are still alive .
researchers believe the illness is caused by infectious proteins called prions being passed to humans through meat contaminated with the brains and spinal tissue of cattle suffering from bse , or mad cow disease .
but the exact route remains a mystery .
now , professor dearmond , one of the world 's leading prion experts , has told the bbc that inflammation in the throat area of victims could be the key factor .
" all i am trying to do is search for something that would get the protein into the lymphoreticular system , particularly into the tonsils , and certainly some irritation there , injury or inflammation , might have been one way that these 90-odd people were unlucky , " he said .
prion reservoirs the tonsils are an important focus for research because they are known to be a reservoir for prions .
it is this fact that has prompted british hospitals to dispose of all surgical implements used in tonsillectomies , to counter the very slight risk that the equipment could pass vcjd from one patient to another .
but professor dearmond said serious consideration was now being given to the idea that the tonsils were the route through which the primary infection from cattle to humans occurred .
" why does it -lsb- the infection -rsb- get into the tonsils for instance and it does n't happen in sporadic cjd or any other forms of cjd that we know of .
" could it be that these patients had a sore throat and they were just unlucky that they ate a sausage or a meat pie that had a lot of bse brain associated with it ?
" again , i 'm trying to think of any other factor that would explain why a relatively small number of individuals would get the disease . "
with perhaps 30 % to 40 % of the british population having the genetic make-up susceptible to vcjd infection , and so many contaminated meals eaten over the years , professor dearmond said one could have expected many more victims to have emerged by now .
age profile however , if sore throats had acted as a contributory , but limiting , factor , it might also explain the age profile of vcjd victims .
young people go through a lot of colds and sore throats that you become immune to later in life professor stephen dearmond , ucsf " young people go through a lot of colds and sore throats that you become immune to later in life , " professor dearmond said .
" as you get older , you experience more viruses and you reach a stage where you become less susceptible to these problems . "
researchers in the uk said the ideas expressed by professor dearmond were plausible but nothing had been proven .
teeth theory " the truth is we do n't know what the reason is for the particular age distribution of the vcjd cases that have been observed so far , " said professor peter smith , the acting chairman of the government 's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee -lrb- seac -rrb- .
" there are a lot of changes that take place around adolescence .
other people have suggested for example that it may be related to the sort of changes in teeth that take place at around that age - with some dental procedures there may be a risk .
" these are all possible hypotheses but we really do n't know . "
the ucsf professor is a colleague of stanley prusiner , the scientist honoured with a nobel prize for his pioneering work on prions .
californian researchers are now developing a therapy that will block the action of infectious prions .
the therapy , which has shown promise in the lab , will go into animal trials in the next 12 months .
if these experiments are successful , they could lead to an effective treatment for spongiform diseases in humans within 10 years , professor dearmond said .

the kangaroo industry association of australia is predicting a rise of 20 % in sales as foot and mouth disease and mad cow disease , or bse , affect stocks of traditional meat supplies .
" orders are coming from right across europe but it is our traditional markets of germany , belgium , denmark and france that are buying the most , " said the association 's development manager , john kelly .
demand for kangaroo meat has increased , especially for input into sausages and so on for its low fat content peter amey , australian trade commission kangaroo meat is exported to more than 30 countries but europe remains the largest market , taking about 80 % of the total .
australian trade representatives say a number of countries in the region are looking for alternatives to meat usually imported from the european union .
" one of the side issues in the foot and mouth crisis is that the demand for kangaroo meat has increased , especially for input into sausages and so on for its low fat content , " said the australian trade commission 's european manager , peter amey .
healthy alternative the meat is a low-fat red meat with a strong game taste , high in iron and protein .
sydney chef paul allen said it is one of the healthiest dishes available .
" the leanness makes kangaroo very healthy but you 've got to prepare it with great care .
" overcook it and it is ruined , but get it right and it is a dream . "
australia is home to 48 species of kangaroo but only four are harvested on a commercial basis .
more than two million animals are killed every year destined for dinner tables around the world .
the industry says that if kangaroo numbers were left unchecked the economic damage inflicted on crops and the environmental could be devastating .
the industry has faced its fair share of problems in the past .
a report by the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals claimed that at least 15 % of kangaroos killed commercially die inhumanely .
wildlife campaigners believe the meat is not as safe and healthy as the exporters have claimed as kangaroos can carry potentially harmful parasites .
quarantine tightened meanwhile , australia has puts in place strict new quarantine measures to try to protect itself from foot and mouth disease .
animal products , including meat , dairy and leather from the affected areas have all been banned .
more x-ray machines are being installed at international airports and special check introduced on passengers from britain and france .
three teams of sniffer dogs are being sent to international postal centres to sift through mail sent from overseas .
the australian quarantine inspection service has said it will review the restrictions , assessing the threat daily .

tayside university hospital trust had a deficit of £ 10m last year , the largest of any trust in scotland .
the parliament 's audit committee wants to ensure taxpayers ' money is being spent effectively and is expected to call senior health service officials to give evidence .
as part of its investigation , the committee will next month become the first scottish parliament committee to meet in dundee .
and it is expected to publish its findings in may .
the decision to hold the inquiry follows the publication on friday of a report into the nhs in tayside by the auditor general robert black .
mr black 's report follows his first overview of the nhs in scotland published in december 2000 in which he found that eight out of scotland 's 28 health trusts were running budget deficits .
tayside university hospitals nhs trust had the largest deficit at £ 10m .
audit committee convener andrew welsh said : " it also had the lowest rate of return of any nhs trust , just 0.1 % compared with a national target of 6 % in scotland .
" quite clearly there are major financial and operational difficulties in tayside .
this will be the subject of our investigation .
taxpayers ' money " as with all audit committee inquiries , our priority is to ensure that taxpayers ' money is being spent effectively and that best value is being derived from public expenditure .
" given the importance of this matter to the people of tayside , our members have agreed it is vital we convene the first ever scottish parliamentary committee meeting in dundee . "
the committee 's meeting , which will be open to the public , will be held on the afternoon of monday 2 april , in dundee city council chamber .
senior officials from tayside health board , tayside primary care nhs trust , tayside university hospital nhs trust and the nhs in scotland are likely to be called to give oral evidence to the committee .
quite clearly there are major financial and operational difficulties in tayside .
this will be the subject of our investigation audit committee convener andrew welsh in his report mr black highlights the need for " careful management and monitoring of financial recovery plans " in tayside .
he said tayside had inherited " a range of difficulties beyond their control " .
and mr black found bosses were taking steps to address areas of concern including the establishment of a joint management group and the drawing up of financial recovery plans .
but he added : " there is continuing uncertainty as to how tayside university hospitals trust in particular will achieve financial balance and eliminate deficits .
acute services review " while it has drawn up plans to improve financial and managerial weaknesses , it is still not exactly clear how improvements will be achieved .
" it is particularly important that the ongoing acute services review , due later this year , is completed as soon as possible and the health bodies must press ahead with their studies comparing tayside 's high unit costs with nhs bodies elsewhere in scotland . "
the report found there was room for improvement in the accountability and reporting of tayside health bodies to the scottish executive health department .

last month the report had said that the pace of recovery had become more " moderate " .
slowdown the economic blip was attributed to the slowdown in the united states , which has prompted japanese exports to falter .
in light of the downgrade , analysts are growing increasingly certain that the bank of japan will return to a zero interest-rate policy , which was abandoned last year amid controversy .
but despite the admission that the country is suffering from deflation , the government remained adamant that the economy is still heading toward a self-sustaining recovery .

research by cancer research campaign scientists showed that leukaemia cases were 3.6 times average rates in orkney and shetland during the war , when a large contingent of servicemen lived on the islands .
the incidence rate fell back to the scottish average after the war .
one of the scientists who carried out the study , professor leo kinlen , told bbc news online it was highly likely that the mixing of local people and servicemen caused the increase in cases .
it all strongly suggests that an infection plays an important role in leukaemia professor leo kinlen , cancer research campaign he said it added to evidence that infection was the cause of at least some childhood leukaemias .
the study , published in the lancet , looked at records for over 12,000 children from the wartime period and 6,478 children born in orkney and shetland between 1946 and 1955 .
in the wartime group , there were nine deaths compared to the scottish average of 2.5 .
the post-war group was followed up until 1970 , and it was found there were just three deaths , compared with the 2.8 expected .
during world war ii , as many as 60,000 servicemen were stationed on the island .
there were also 40,000 naval personnel in the area .
locals outnumbered orkney was also home to thousands of irish construction workers , italian prisoners of war and norwegian refugees .
the incoming population outnumbered the local people .
professor kinlen said : " increases like this have been found in other situations where there 's been a mixing of populations within rural areas .
" it all strongly suggests that an infection plays an important role in leukaemia . "
however , professor kinlen stressed that the development of cancer was a very rare complication of an infection that in most people would cause no illness at all .
angela balkiwell , who co-wrote the study added : " we think the most likely explanation for the difference is that the war-time group were newly exposed to a leukaemia-causing infection " ken campbell , clinical information officer for the leukaemia research fund said : " this research has tackled the issue in an extremely imaginative way and adds extra data to the existing body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of population mixing as a contributory cause of childhood leukaemia . "
vaccine hope the crc said it believed professor kinlen 's study provided further evidence that a mystery infection , probably a virus , is one of the factors responsible for childhood leukaemia .
it said if the infectious agent could be identified , the next step might be a vaccine to prevent leukaemia from developing .
professor gordon mcvie , director general of the crc , added : " this work is important because it provides further evidence that an infection such as a virus , is an important - if not the most important - cause of childhood leukaemia .
" we 're now a step closer to the ultimate goal of leukaemia research , which is to track down the nature of the infection and develop vaccines against it . "
