martyn and kay tott said that they may take legal action after learning that the national lottery operator paid out £ 130,000 to a syndicate that missed the 30-day deadline for claiming on a lost ticket .
camelot has already told the watford couple it will not honour their £ 3,011,065 win because they missed the same deadline as this would set a precedent for flouting the rules .
it said the payout to the syndicate in dudley was a " human error " and would not affect the pair 's claim .
why pay them and choose just to ruin our lives martyn tott but mr tott , 33 , said the company had told him that his was a unique case .
when he saw a copy of the letter sent to the syndicate saying camelot could pay out at its discretion , he said he could not believe the company 's " bare-faced cheek " .
speaking from the couple 's watford home on sunday , mr tott told bbc news 24 that the discrepancy between camelot 's attitude in the two cases was unacceptable .
" you ca n't turn round once you done something wrong and just say ooh sorry it was a mistake , because what is the point of having rules in the first place , " he said .
camelot and the lottery commission had said that to pay the totts would undermine the lottery 's rules and damage its integrity .
" why pay them and choose just to ruin our lives .
" i do n't know what else we need to do to get the money , " he argued .
chris smith hoped camelot would " see reason " a syndicate from dudley in the west midlands managed to flout the rules with a late claim in december for a prize draw four months earlier .
graham friend , boss of the dudley syndicate , told the sunday mirror newspaper : " we could n't understand why camelot paid out to us and was refusing to pay out to them . "
a camelot spokesman replied : " we are aware of it and we have never consciously broken the 30-day rule .
' human error ' " in this case the payment was made in human error .
he said the incident happened at a busy time because the company was concentrating on its application to win back the lottery licence .
mr and mrs tott answered a television appeal on 5 march over an unclaimed jackpot ticket bought for the draw six months earlier .
last week culture secretary chris smith said camelot should " see reason " and give the couple the prize money .

the parliament in skopje overwhelmingly endorsed prime minister ljupco georgievski 's new government , which includes the two main parties of the ethnic albanian minority .
a bbc correspondent in skopje says the main task of the new administration will be to restore peace to a country teetering on the brink of civil war .
but he says the government faces a difficult task in persuading the rebels to withdraw without more bloodshed , while striking a deal to improve relations between macedonia 's ethnic communities and preparing for new elections .
deputies voted 104-to-one in favour of the new government .
there were four abstentions .
the parliamentary approval vote was delayed by several hours after one of the albanian parties - the party for democratic prosperity -lrb- pdp -rrb- - said it was opposed to harsh language used by mr georgievski when submitting his cabinet before deputies .
fiery speech in his speech , mr georgievski said the ethnic albanian rebels were a " cruel enemy that had to be crushed " .
the prime minister said : " the republic of macedonia is facing a difficult test , perhaps the most difficult since the proclamation of independence .
" we shall make maximum preparations - political , organisational , military and financial - to crush the force of this dangerous enemy whose activities our state has to endure . "
the bbc 's nick thorpe says the pdp , which reluctantly agreed to join the government under intense international pressure , was clearly upset by mr georgievski 's language .
the party said it was the speech of a party leader , not of a man leading a whole nation in a time of crisis .
ahead of the session , the macedonian army stopped shelling villages where the militants were believed to be positioned .
but heavy exchanges subsequently resumed .
army spokesman colonel blagoja markovski told reporters that the rebels had attacked government troops later in the day near the villages of slupcane and orizare and the army had fired back , using heavy artillery and tanks .
there were no casualties on the macedonian side .
there has been no word from the rebels of the national liberation army .
the spokesman said hostilities had ceased by the evening .
the macedonian army said it had killed 30 rebels during a massive operation on saturday , but the militants have denied losing any fighters .
