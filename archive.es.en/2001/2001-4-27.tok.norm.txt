all babies will receive at least £ 250 at birth - and poorer children up to £ 500 - with the money invested until they become adults .
' baby bond ' birth : £ 250-500 age 5 : £ 50-100 age 11 : £ 50-100 age 16 : £ 50-100 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total : £ 400-800 mr blair said : " piece by piece we are dismantling the barriers that hold people back from developing their potential to the full . "
shadow chancellor michael portillo dismissed the scheme as a " con " timed purely for the expected june election .
in addition to the payments at birth , poorest children will have top-ups of £ 100 on their fifth , 11th and 16th birthdays - better off children will get half that amount .
trust fund the money - up to £ 800 in all - would be invested in a trust fund , potentially yielding thousands of pounds by the time a child reaches adulthood .
mr blair also announced a savings gateway account under which money invested by poorer households would be matched pound for pound by the treasury . "
it 's a complete con " michael portillo mr blair told a downing street press conference on thursday the bonds would help create a " real land of opportunity for all " .
he said : " we want to see all children growing up knowing they have a financial stake in their communities .
" it will be a financial springboard to better education , better homes and a better life . "
cash for education earlier chancellor gordon brown said there would be consultation on the age at which children would receive the money and under what conditions .
ministers would like it to be spent on education , training , buying a home or setting up a business . "
we plan to make it possible for them to own and value wealth " chancellor gordon brown mr portillo told the bbc : " it 's a complete con .
" what he plans to drip feed to the next generation is tiny compared to the amount he has taken from this generation , from families , pensioners and businesses .
" labour 's stealth taxes are impoverishing britain , soaking up disposable income and punishing saving . "
adult savers under the savings gateway account , the government would match savings of poorer adults pound for pound up to £ 1,800 .
they would have to save for three years and after that the money could be transferred to an individual savings account -lrb- isa -rrb- , a pension or a children 's trust fund .
the idea is based on schemes in the united states set up by the former president bill clinton .
in america low-paid savers with individual development accounts get two tax dollars for every dollar they put away .
on average people in the schemes are saving $ 25 a month .
the government clearly sees this as one of the big ideas for the election .
there are 16 million people in the uk with no savings at all - most of them on low incomes .
in a phrase reminiscent of margaret thatcher , mr brown says this will open up " a wealth-owning , asset-owning democracy for all " .
' gimmick ' liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said there was " gimmickry " in the pre-election timing of the bonds .
he added : " for many of those who in 18 years time will go on to be university students , all it will do is provide a dent in the overhang generated by student tuition fees . "
if the £ 800 per child 's trust fund had been invested on the stock market 18 years ago , it would be worth around £ 4,500 today .
but an independent financial adviser consulted by the bbc warned that future investments could yield much less .

speaking in a bbc interview , mr ben eliezer also urged the palestinian leader yasser arafat to make efforts to stop the violence .
mr ben eliezer is not a man whom most palestinians view with great affection .
as a former israeli general and now as defence minister , he represents the might of the army that confronts them .
but now he appears to be offering the palestinians an olive branch , saying he wanted most palestinians to know that they were not his enemy .
he said he wanted to do all he could to make their lives easier and would soon be allowing tens of thousands of palestinians to cross into israel to work .
' strong leader ' the israeli defence minister said he was sure mr arafat was trying to find a way for arabs and israelis to live together .
he noted that when mr arafat had ordered a stop to the mortaring of israeli houses , it had indeed stopped .
mr arafat , he said , was a strong leader .
this is all a far cry from the vilification of yasser arafat that has been commonplace amongst israeli officials and their public alike .
it reflects , perhaps , a realisation in the hardline israeli government that mr arafat is someone that israel has got to keep talking to .
over the next few days , israel 's foreign minister , shimon peres , is due to discuss a tentative arab peace plan with egyptian and jordanian leaders before travelling to washington .
nobody is holding out any great hopes of a breakthrough , but at least for now there is a semblance of an arab-israeli dialogue .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- telecoms giants in merger talks , report says low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 27 april , 2001 , 06:17 gmt 07:17 uk telecoms giants in merger talks , report says no smiles at lucent as it battles bad loans and accelerates lay-offs lucent technologies and alcatel , the us and french telecoms equipment giants , have been holding preliminary talks about a merger , the wall street journal europe newspaper reported .
citing sources familiar with the situation , the newspaper said a deal was now " financially plausible " although the two sides had n't yet discussed financial terms .
it admitted the chances of a deal materialising were " slim " .
both companies have a market value of about £ 25bn -lrb- $ 35bn -rrb- .
earlier this week , alcatel said it had submitted a bid for lucent 's fibre-optic unit , which is expected to fetch at least $ 4bn .
both companies have recently announced quarterly results that showed the extent of the -lrb- different -rrb- problems they are facing .
lucent restructuring lucent reported a $ 3.7bn -lrb- £ 2.6bn -rrb- operating loss for its second quarter and said it would acclerate plans to shed 10,000 jobs .
the company is pursuing far-reaching restructuring plans in attempts to return to financial health .
much of the damage to lucent 's performance was done by investments in and loans to winstar , a broadband communications provider which has filed for bankruptcy protection .
lucent - formerly known as at & t international - was spun off from its parent in 1996 and was once the world 's biggest telecoms equipment supplier .
but it has struggled to compete in the key optical networking market and faced falling demand for its core telephone equipment products .
some analysts have been sceptical that the restructuring will have the desired effect .
they have said the company might be able to improve its financial position with cost cuts but will struggle to compete , given its current product portfolio .
lucent shares have dropped nearly 90 % on the new york stock exchange in the past year .
recently , lucent has been forced to deny rumours that it is on the verge of bankruptcy .
alcatel outsourcing alcatel has been battling a sharp slowdown in the european mobile phone market .
earlier this week , it downgraded its expectations for 2001 sales to growth of 5-15 % having earlier predicted 20-25 % growth .
it said that because of slower growth it had decided to outsource mobile phone production to singapore-based flextronics - the same company to which ericsson recently agreed to transfer its handset manufacturing .
it reported first-quarter net profit down 19 % to 210m euros , saying the performance of the handset unit had cut 150m euros from profits .
the company said it planned to cut costs by $ 1bn a year and reduce working capital by the same amount .

citing sources familiar with the situation , the newspaper said a deal was now " financially plausible " although the two sides had n't yet discussed financial terms .
it admitted the chances of a deal materialising were " slim " .
both companies have a market value of about £ 25bn -lrb- $ 35bn -rrb- .
earlier this week , alcatel said it had submitted a bid for lucent 's fibre-optic unit , which is expected to fetch at least $ 4bn .
both companies have recently announced quarterly results that showed the extent of the -lrb- different -rrb- problems they are facing .
lucent restructuring lucent reported a $ 3.7bn -lrb- £ 2.6bn -rrb- operating loss for its second quarter and said it would acclerate plans to shed 10,000 jobs .
the company is pursuing far-reaching restructuring plans in attempts to return to financial health .
much of the damage to lucent 's performance was done by investments in and loans to winstar , a broadband communications provider which has filed for bankruptcy protection .
lucent - formerly known as at & t international - was spun off from its parent in 1996 and was once the world 's biggest telecoms equipment supplier .
but it has struggled to compete in the key optical networking market and faced falling demand for its core telephone equipment products .
some analysts have been sceptical that the restructuring will have the desired effect .
they have said the company might be able to improve its financial position with cost cuts but will struggle to compete , given its current product portfolio .
lucent shares have dropped nearly 90 % on the new york stock exchange in the past year .
recently , lucent has been forced to deny rumours that it is on the verge of bankruptcy .
alcatel outsourcing alcatel has been battling a sharp slowdown in the european mobile phone market .
earlier this week , it downgraded its expectations for 2001 sales to growth of 5-15 % having earlier predicted 20-25 % growth .
it said that because of slower growth it had decided to outsource mobile phone production to singapore-based flextronics - the same company to which ericsson recently agreed to transfer its handset manufacturing .
it reported first-quarter net profit down 19 % to 210m euros , saying the performance of the handset unit had cut 150m euros from profits .
the company said it planned to cut costs by $ 1bn a year and reduce working capital by the same amount .
