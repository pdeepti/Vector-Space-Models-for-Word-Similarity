uk defence secretary geoff hoon admitted that the force - to be led by general john mccoll - would face a " challenging , difficult and sometimes dangerous " task in kabul , which is controlled by a number of armed factions .
bbc correspondent daniel sandford said : " it could go very well , but it only takes one warlord to take against it and it could become very difficult . "
france has said it is willing to send as many as 800 soldiers to the multinational force , and spain has offered a battalion of 700 combat troops .
the netherlands , germany and italy are also expected to be major european contributors .

the official opening of all five lanes on the bridge over the river tamar , on the devon and cornwall border , took place on thursday .
the work , which was scheduled for completion in november , was at one point three months behind schedule and due to end in february 2002 .
but after months of ' catch up ' work , the scheme has been completed in time for christmas , with the four traffic lanes ready to open .
delays and tailbacks the tamar bridge and torpoint ferries joint committee said the delay was a result of the bad weather last winter .
the bridge first opened in 1961 with three lanes for traffic and a central span of 335m -lrb- 1100ft -rrb- .
when it was opened , it was the longest suspension bridge in the uk .
the scheme has caused tailbacks for motorists driving between devon and cornwall , while traders in saltash in cornwall believe it has affected business .
improving commerce but the tamar bridge and torpoint ferry joint committee said the scheme was necessary because the structure was below the required strength for 40 tonne loading .
the committee said : " if strengthening work had not gone ahead , a 17 tonne weight restriction would have been imposed on vehicles .
" such a low weight limit on this vital transport link would , undoubtedly , have had serious consequences for commerce in south east cornwall . "
now cyclists and pedestrians will use the southern cantilever lane and local traffic eastbound from saltash will use the northern cantilever lane .
traffic using the a38 will use the three centre lanes .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- analysis : roots of sulawesi conflict categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 20 december , 2001 , 06:43 gmt analysis : roots of sulawesi conflict by regional analyst nicholas nugent central sulawesi is a remote and backward province of indonesia wedged between the predominantly christian north of sulawesi island and the mainly muslim south .
its people earn a living from farming and fishing ; the province gets little investment and contributes little to the national economy .
the closeness of ramadan and christmas may have contributed to the heightened communal tension traditionally christians and muslims have lived side by side in harmony , but three years ago a particularly brutal outbreak of inter-communal hostilities propelled the quiet town of poso onto the nation 's front pages .
after a period of relative calm , violence again broke out in november 2001 .
some claimed the violence was a spill-over from the fighting between christian and muslim communities in the moluccan islands to the east .
others believe it was a consequence of the influx of mainly muslim migrants from java to this under-populated region , which has reduced the christian majority and thus their powerful position .
' black magic ' muslims now dominate political and commercial life in the area around poso where the violence first erupted .
about 200 people died in fighting in 2000 it was a drunken brawl between christian and muslim youths that sparked the violence in december 1998 - leaving hundreds dead and thousands homeless .
unfounded rumours that churches had been burned added to the chaotic atmosphere and exacerbated the violence .
there were claims too that black magic was being invoked in this very traditional region .
many of those killed had been abducted from their homes and their decapitated bodies were later fished out of the poso river .
by the time the violence subsided many months later , an estimated 1,000 people had been killed .
tens of thousands of mainly christians inhabitants had been expelled from poso and surrounding villages .
poso itself lay in ruins .
a strengthened military garrison maintained an uneasy peace .
' intimidation ' now the violence has broken out again , with at least 100 people killed in the poso area during the muslim fasting month that ended in mid-december .
christians -lrb- pictured -rrb- and muslims have appealed for peace christians say the new violence was caused by the arrival in poso of the laskar jihad , or holy warriors , a java-based organisation which claims to offer protection for muslims it says are being besieged by other communities .
in 2000 laskar jihad was blamed for escalating muslim-christian violence in ambon , the moluccan capital .
in poso , a rival paramilitary organisation , the christian red force , emerged to retaliate against what christians say are attempts to intimidate them into leaving their homes .
both militant groups are armed with traditional spears , bows and arrows and slings as well as homemade firearms and bombs .
a series of tit-for-tat raids in villages south of poso in november left at least 12 people dead and caused an exodus of christians southwards to the town of tentena on lake poso .
as many as 50,000 refugees were reported to have arrived in the town , a vast number in this sparsely populated and remote region .
religious festivals muslims had threatened to occupy tentena before eid al-fitr , the feast in mid-december which marks the end of the fasting month .
indonesia is a mainly muslim country in the end , no violence was reported , but the closeness of ramadan and christmas may have contributed to the heightened communal tension .
muslims have accused christians of failing to respect the fasting month .
three years ago the first violence broke out when the start of the muslim fasting month coincided with christmas .
poso 's remoteness has made it difficult for the authorities to quell the violence .
the provincial capital , palu , is four hours away by road .
poso has no airport and no local newspapers , a factor blamed for the rapid spread of rumours .
but jakarta has stepped up security and there are signs the government may be prepared to clamp down on armed groups from outside the province , like the laskar jihad .
president megawati sukarnoputri , who represents a nationalist rather than an islamic political party , is already walking a tightrope .
she has publicly supported us president george bush in his anti-terror campaign , but under pressure from muslim groups , she criticised the bombing of muslim afghanistan .
the war in afghanistan has led to an increased militancy amongst some indonesian muslims , who feel they have lost power with the accession of mrs megawati .

its people earn a living from farming and fishing ; the province gets little investment and contributes little to the national economy .
the closeness of ramadan and christmas may have contributed to the heightened communal tension traditionally christians and muslims have lived side by side in harmony , but three years ago a particularly brutal outbreak of inter-communal hostilities propelled the quiet town of poso onto the nation 's front pages .
after a period of relative calm , violence again broke out in november 2001 .
some claimed the violence was a spill-over from the fighting between christian and muslim communities in the moluccan islands to the east .
others believe it was a consequence of the influx of mainly muslim migrants from java to this under-populated region , which has reduced the christian majority and thus their powerful position .
' black magic ' muslims now dominate political and commercial life in the area around poso where the violence first erupted .
it was a drunken brawl between christian and muslim youths that sparked the violence in december 1998 - leaving hundreds dead and thousands homeless .
unfounded rumours that churches had been burned added to the chaotic atmosphere and exacerbated the violence .
there were claims too that black magic was being invoked in this very traditional region .
many of those killed had been abducted from their homes and their decapitated bodies were later fished out of the poso river .
by the time the violence subsided many months later , an estimated 1,000 people had been killed .
tens of thousands of mainly christians inhabitants had been expelled from poso and surrounding villages .
poso itself lay in ruins .
a strengthened military garrison maintained an uneasy peace .
' intimidation ' now the violence has broken out again , with at least 100 people killed in the poso area during the muslim fasting month that ended in mid-december .

the scottish executive had rejected pleas from st mary 's episcopal primary school in dunblane to retain the " opt-out " status it has had since 1993 .
in august , the then education minister jack mcconnell signed an order to place the school under the management of stirling council in january 2002 .
now the scottish executive has revised the order to allow parents fighting the decision to hear the outcome of their appeal .
parents have already petitioned for a judicial review at the court of session , arguing that the decision to return the school to council control breached european human rights legislation and was based on political dogma .
but in a written judgement , lord eassie ruled they had not been discriminated against nor had their rights infringed .
the parents then instructed their lawyers to appeal the decision and a court hearing had been arranged for thursday .
on the eve of this latest challenge , the scottish executive surprised parents by confirming that date to handover the school to stirling council had been moved back to 1 april 2002 .
an executive spokeswoman said the move had been agreed to allow the outcome of any appeal to be heard before the primary was transferred .
unpopular policy to date , parents have already raised more than Â£ 10,000 to fight the case and are seeking a major donor who is willing to underwrite the cost of a possible appeal to the house of lords .
st mary 's primary was one of just two schools in scotland to become self-governing when the previous conservative uk government allowed schools to opt out of local authority control and receive their funding directly from central government .
this policy proved popular in england but attracted little support north of the border .
the other school , dornoch academy in sutherland , has since returned to council control .
the move to return st mary 's to local authority control comes after the scottish parliament passed the standards in scotland 's schools bill last year .

bbc news -pipe- music -pipe- bands tempted by reunion lucre categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : music front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 20 december , 2001 , 07:41 gmt bands tempted by reunion lucre the who alienated some fans during their comeback the sex pistols may be reforming for reunion gigs - again .
bbc news online 's ian youngs looks at other groups who have felt the temptation to get back together .
when the sex pistols reformed for a world tour in 1996 , john lydon - formerly johnny rotten - made it very clear why the band members had buried their differences .
" we have found a common cause , and it 's your money , " he sneered .
the velvet underground fell out again during the reunion tour a number of other bands have found that the lure of filthy lucre can overcome arguments that caused them to split up decades before .
the velvet underground originally imploded in 1970 after a rift between lou reed and john cale - but by the early 1990s , a new generation of fans made them cool again and lifted their popularity levels higher than ever .
the original line-up embarked on a european tour in 1993 - but reed and cale fell out again before the band could even start the united states leg and the reunion fell apart .
but thousands of fans got to see the band before guitarist sterling morrison died two years later .
guitar-smashing rockers the who were one of the biggest bands of the 1960s and 70s , and have held a number of reunions since .
blondie performed at the glastonbury festival in 1999 the group fell apart after wild drummer keith moon died in 1978 , but burst back onto the stage with a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 .
that tour alienated some fans who thought the motive behind it was money .
they continued to get back together for shows - live aid and roger daltrey 's 50th birthday among them - and two recently announced charity gigs at london 's royal albert hall .
in early 2001 , roxy music went on tour 18 years after they split up - but without founding member brian eno , who criticised his former colleagues .
" it 's obvious why it 's being done .
why does anyone have a reunion ? " he said .
plus a glut of pop idols , including adam and the ants and spandau ballet , have suddenly reappeared on arena tours , cashing in on nostalgia for all things 80s under the here and now banner .
in 1995 , the remaining beatles recorded new songs blondie , who have stood the time as one of the more credible bands to emerge from the 1980s , got back together to record a new album and do a tour in 1999 .
and boy george fits in culture club tours in between his stints as a club dj .
one band who hardly needed the money was the beatles , and john lennon 's death in 1980 scotched any chances of a reunion .
but the three remaining members still managed to record some new songs in 1995 .
mccartney , harrison and starr added the music to vocals lennon sang into a tape recorder in 1977 , and free as a bird was the result .
the single narrowly failed to reach the number one spot on both sides of the atlantic , while real love was another new hit the following year .
abba : turned down a $ 1bn offer the original members of lennon 's first band the quarrymen did not become quite so successful as the beatles - but pete shotton , len gary , rod davies , eric griffiths and colin hanton got back together for a show in 1997 .
there was little fanfare , though - it was for a school fete .
one band has resisted the a considerable temptation to get back together , though - abba turned down a reported $ 1bn -lrb- Â£ 690m -rrb- offer to tour .
" it is a hell of a lot of money to say no to , but we decided it was n't for us , " benny andersson told a swedish newspaper in 2000 .
" we have never made a comeback .
