a bbc correspondent says there has been difficulty agreeing how long the force should stay in afghanistan and what its relationship should be with the american-led military campaign in the country .
all the major sticking points which held up a vote on the issue for days have now been resolved .

he said the international force should leave " as soon as we have the protection of our borders , of our country and a government chosen by the afghan people " .
the document does not state the actual size of the force , but it is expected to number about 5,000 soldiers , with britain contributing about 1,500 of her own .
the remaining troops will not begin to deploy before 28 december .
armed factions but the force may not be operational until at least the middle of january because of its reliance upon bagram airport 40km north of kabul for both deployment and re-supply .
uk defence secretary geoff hoon admitted that the force - to be led by general john mccoll - would face a " challenging , difficult and sometimes dangerous " task in kabul , which is controlled by a number of armed factions .
bbc correspondent daniel sandford said : " it could go very well , but it only takes one warlord to take against it and it could become very difficult . "
france has said it is willing to send as many as 800 soldiers to the multinational force , and spain has offered a battalion of 700 combat troops .
the netherlands , germany and italy are also expected to be major european contributors .

the official opening of all five lanes on the bridge over the river tamar , on the devon and cornwall border , took place on thursday .
the work , which was scheduled for completion in november , was at one point three months behind schedule and due to end in february 2002 .
but after months of ' catch up ' work , the scheme has been completed in time for christmas , with the four traffic lanes ready to open .
delays and tailbacks the tamar bridge and torpoint ferries joint committee said the delay was a result of the bad weather last winter .
the bridge first opened in 1961 with three lanes for traffic and a central span of 335m -lrb- 1100ft -rrb- .
when it was opened , it was the longest suspension bridge in the uk .
the scheme has caused tailbacks for motorists driving between devon and cornwall , while traders in saltash in cornwall believe it has affected business .
improving commerce but the tamar bridge and torpoint ferry joint committee said the scheme was necessary because the structure was below the required strength for 40 tonne loading .
the committee said : " if strengthening work had not gone ahead , a 17 tonne weight restriction would have been imposed on vehicles .
" such a low weight limit on this vital transport link would , undoubtedly , have had serious consequences for commerce in south east cornwall . "
now cyclists and pedestrians will use the southern cantilever lane and local traffic eastbound from saltash will use the northern cantilever lane .
traffic using the a38 will use the three centre lanes .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- analysis : roots of sulawesi conflict categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 20 december , 2001 , 06:43 gmt analysis : roots of sulawesi conflict by regional analyst nicholas nugent central sulawesi is a remote and backward province of indonesia wedged between the predominantly christian north of sulawesi island and the mainly muslim south .
its people earn a living from farming and fishing ; the province gets little investment and contributes little to the national economy .
the closeness of ramadan and christmas may have contributed to the heightened communal tension traditionally christians and muslims have lived side by side in harmony , but three years ago a particularly brutal outbreak of inter-communal hostilities propelled the quiet town of poso onto the nation 's front pages .
after a period of relative calm , violence again broke out in november 2001 .
some claimed the violence was a spill-over from the fighting between christian and muslim communities in the moluccan islands to the east .
others believe it was a consequence of the influx of mainly muslim migrants from java to this under-populated region , which has reduced the christian majority and thus their powerful position .
' black magic ' muslims now dominate political and commercial life in the area around poso where the violence first erupted .
about 200 people died in fighting in 2000 it was a drunken brawl between christian and muslim youths that sparked the violence in december 1998 - leaving hundreds dead and thousands homeless .
unfounded rumours that churches had been burned added to the chaotic atmosphere and exacerbated the violence .
there were claims too that black magic was being invoked in this very traditional region .
many of those killed had been abducted from their homes and their decapitated bodies were later fished out of the poso river .
by the time the violence subsided many months later , an estimated 1,000 people had been killed .
tens of thousands of mainly christians inhabitants had been expelled from poso and surrounding villages .
poso itself lay in ruins .
a strengthened military garrison maintained an uneasy peace .
' intimidation ' now the violence has broken out again , with at least 100 people killed in the poso area during the muslim fasting month that ended in mid-december .
christians -lrb- pictured -rrb- and muslims have appealed for peace christians say the new violence was caused by the arrival in poso of the laskar jihad , or holy warriors , a java-based organisation which claims to offer protection for muslims it says are being besieged by other communities .
in 2000 laskar jihad was blamed for escalating muslim-christian violence in ambon , the moluccan capital .
in poso , a rival paramilitary organisation , the christian red force , emerged to retaliate against what christians say are attempts to intimidate them into leaving their homes .
both militant groups are armed with traditional spears , bows and arrows and slings as well as homemade firearms and bombs .
a series of tit-for-tat raids in villages south of poso in november left at least 12 people dead and caused an exodus of christians southwards to the town of tentena on lake poso .
as many as 50,000 refugees were reported to have arrived in the town , a vast number in this sparsely populated and remote region .
religious festivals muslims had threatened to occupy tentena before eid al-fitr , the feast in mid-december which marks the end of the fasting month .
indonesia is a mainly muslim country in the end , no violence was reported , but the closeness of ramadan and christmas may have contributed to the heightened communal tension .
muslims have accused christians of failing to respect the fasting month .
three years ago the first violence broke out when the start of the muslim fasting month coincided with christmas .
poso 's remoteness has made it difficult for the authorities to quell the violence .
the provincial capital , palu , is four hours away by road .
poso has no airport and no local newspapers , a factor blamed for the rapid spread of rumours .
but jakarta has stepped up security and there are signs the government may be prepared to clamp down on armed groups from outside the province , like the laskar jihad .
president megawati sukarnoputri , who represents a nationalist rather than an islamic political party , is already walking a tightrope .
she has publicly supported us president george bush in his anti-terror campaign , but under pressure from muslim groups , she criticised the bombing of muslim afghanistan .
the war in afghanistan has led to an increased militancy amongst some indonesian muslims , who feel they have lost power with the accession of mrs megawati .

its people earn a living from farming and fishing ; the province gets little investment and contributes little to the national economy .
the closeness of ramadan and christmas may have contributed to the heightened communal tension traditionally christians and muslims have lived side by side in harmony , but three years ago a particularly brutal outbreak of inter-communal hostilities propelled the quiet town of poso onto the nation 's front pages .
after a period of relative calm , violence again broke out in november 2001 .
some claimed the violence was a spill-over from the fighting between christian and muslim communities in the moluccan islands to the east .
others believe it was a consequence of the influx of mainly muslim migrants from java to this under-populated region , which has reduced the christian majority and thus their powerful position .
' black magic ' muslims now dominate political and commercial life in the area around poso where the violence first erupted .
it was a drunken brawl between christian and muslim youths that sparked the violence in december 1998 - leaving hundreds dead and thousands homeless .
unfounded rumours that churches had been burned added to the chaotic atmosphere and exacerbated the violence .
there were claims too that black magic was being invoked in this very traditional region .
many of those killed had been abducted from their homes and their decapitated bodies were later fished out of the poso river .
by the time the violence subsided many months later , an estimated 1,000 people had been killed .
tens of thousands of mainly christians inhabitants had been expelled from poso and surrounding villages .
poso itself lay in ruins .
a strengthened military garrison maintained an uneasy peace .
' intimidation ' now the violence has broken out again , with at least 100 people killed in the poso area during the muslim fasting month that ended in mid-december .

the scottish executive had rejected pleas from st mary 's episcopal primary school in dunblane to retain the " opt-out " status it has had since 1993 .
in august , the then education minister jack mcconnell signed an order to place the school under the management of stirling council in january 2002 .
now the scottish executive has revised the order to allow parents fighting the decision to hear the outcome of their appeal .
parents have already petitioned for a judicial review at the court of session , arguing that the decision to return the school to council control breached european human rights legislation and was based on political dogma .
but in a written judgement , lord eassie ruled they had not been discriminated against nor had their rights infringed .
the parents then instructed their lawyers to appeal the decision and a court hearing had been arranged for thursday .
on the eve of this latest challenge , the scottish executive surprised parents by confirming that date to handover the school to stirling council had been moved back to 1 april 2002 .
an executive spokeswoman said the move had been agreed to allow the outcome of any appeal to be heard before the primary was transferred .
unpopular policy to date , parents have already raised more than £ 10,000 to fight the case and are seeking a major donor who is willing to underwrite the cost of a possible appeal to the house of lords .
st mary 's primary was one of just two schools in scotland to become self-governing when the previous conservative uk government allowed schools to opt out of local authority control and receive their funding directly from central government .
this policy proved popular in england but attracted little support north of the border .
the other school , dornoch academy in sutherland , has since returned to council control .
the move to return st mary 's to local authority control comes after the scottish parliament passed the standards in scotland 's schools bill last year .

bbc news online 's ian youngs looks at other groups who have felt the temptation to get back together .
when the sex pistols reformed for a world tour in 1996 , john lydon - formerly johnny rotten - made it very clear why the band members had buried their differences .
" we have found a common cause , and it 's your money , " he sneered .
the velvet underground fell out again during the reunion tour a number of other bands have found that the lure of filthy lucre can overcome arguments that caused them to split up decades before .
the velvet underground originally imploded in 1970 after a rift between lou reed and john cale - but by the early 1990s , a new generation of fans made them cool again and lifted their popularity levels higher than ever .
the original line-up embarked on a european tour in 1993 - but reed and cale fell out again before the band could even start the united states leg and the reunion fell apart .
but thousands of fans got to see the band before guitarist sterling morrison died two years later .
guitar-smashing rockers the who were one of the biggest bands of the 1960s and 70s , and have held a number of reunions since .
blondie performed at the glastonbury festival in 1999 the group fell apart after wild drummer keith moon died in 1978 , but burst back onto the stage with a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 .
that tour alienated some fans who thought the motive behind it was money .
they continued to get back together for shows - live aid and roger daltrey 's 50th birthday among them - and two recently announced charity gigs at london 's royal albert hall .
in early 2001 , roxy music went on tour 18 years after they split up - but without founding member brian eno , who criticised his former colleagues .
" it 's obvious why it 's being done .
why does anyone have a reunion ? " he said .
plus a glut of pop idols , including adam and the ants and spandau ballet , have suddenly reappeared on arena tours , cashing in on nostalgia for all things 80s under the here and now banner .
in 1995 , the remaining beatles recorded new songs blondie , who have stood the time as one of the more credible bands to emerge from the 1980s , got back together to record a new album and do a tour in 1999 .
and boy george fits in culture club tours in between his stints as a club dj .
one band who hardly needed the money was the beatles , and john lennon 's death in 1980 scotched any chances of a reunion .
but the three remaining members still managed to record some new songs in 1995 .
mccartney , harrison and starr added the music to vocals lennon sang into a tape recorder in 1977 , and free as a bird was the result .
the single narrowly failed to reach the number one spot on both sides of the atlantic , while real love was another new hit the following year .
abba : turned down a $ 1bn offer the original members of lennon 's first band the quarrymen did not become quite so successful as the beatles - but pete shotton , len gary , rod davies , eric griffiths and colin hanton got back together for a show in 1997 .
there was little fanfare , though - it was for a school fete .
one band has resisted the a considerable temptation to get back together , though - abba turned down a reported $ 1bn -lrb- £ 690m -rrb- offer to tour .
" it is a hell of a lot of money to say no to , but we decided it was n't for us , " benny andersson told a swedish newspaper in 2000 .
" we have never made a comeback .
