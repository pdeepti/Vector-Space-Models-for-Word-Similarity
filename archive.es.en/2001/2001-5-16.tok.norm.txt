bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- c & w 's money to burn low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 16 may , 2001 , 05:30 gmt 06:30 uk c & w 's money to burn wallace : why would he want to help out bt ?
by the bbc 's rory cellan-jones it is a problem just about everyone else in the telecoms industry would love to have .
but cable & wireless 's huge cash mountain is proving something of a headache for its chief executive graham wallace .
in the two years since mr wallace took over at the helm , cable & wireless has been slimmed down and set on a new , more focused course .
while its rivals were off on a spending spree , this company was selling assets around the world - from hong kong , to australia , to its british domestic cable tv services .
it has been part of a decision to transform itself into a company focusing principally on business customers , while at the same uniting its voice , data and internet services on a single network .
the result - by the summer , cable & wireless is expected to have about £ 6bn sloshing around its balance sheet .
increasing pressure but as the likes of bt struggle to reduce their crippling debts , the market has been asking just what the other big name in britain 's telecommunications industry plans to do with all that money .
there has been increasing pressure on mr wallace either to return money to shareholders or to prove that he can strengthen cable & wireless by making acquisitions .
this week mr wallace did spend a little of the cash pile on an american internet services group digital island .
but the £ 250m purchase price meant this was pretty small beer - after all , bt spent 20 times as much on its british third-generation mobile phone licence last year .
bizarre mr wallace faces a difficult choice .
he has to prove to his shareholders that their money would be better spent buying telecoms assets at a time when the industry is in crisis rather than putting it into their bank accounts where it can safely earn a little interest .
institutional investors have been pressing him to act quickly .
some even seem to feel that cash from cable & wireless would be handy at a time when bt is asking investors to put nearly £ 6bn pounds into its rights issue .
to ask one prudent telecoms firm to help prop up its profligate rival seems particularly bizarre .
more us purchases but cable & wireless , which realised 18 months ago that it could not afford to compete in every area of its industry , is determined to continue with its more focused approach .
that may mean more purchases in the united states as it builds a global presence in the business networks of the future .
in the meantime the company faces plenty of turbulence .
even if it has not splashed out fanciful sums on mobile phone licences - one area from which it has now withdrawn - it is still suffering from the economic slowdown as business customers trim their investments .
but if it spends its money wisely , cable & wireless could emerge from the crisis afflicting its industry in a much stronger position .

the move is expected to save consumers millions of pounds , with sainsbury 's , tesco and safeway cutting the price of certain medicines and vitamins .
it could also prompt a fierce price war , with boots already introducing a range of new promotions on medicines in an effort to stop supermarkets poaching its customers .
new prices sainsbury 's - 16 nurofen now £ 1.14 from £ 2.29 sainsbury 's - seven seas evening primrose oil now £ 2.79 from £ 5.59 tesco - 16 anadin extra £ 1.29 from £ 2.15 the ruling has been condemned by the community pharmacy action group -lrb- cpag -rrb- .
it says the move could lead to the closure of 12,000 local pharmacies .
the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- challenged the price-fixing law - known as resale price maintenance - in the restrictive practices court , arguing that it allowed drug companies to keep branded over-the-counter products artificially high .
cpag had campaigned to keep rpm , arguing that high street chemist shops would lose business and be forced to close if the supermarkets launch price-cutting wars .
but the court found there was insufficient evidence that a significant number of pharmacies would be shut and ruled rpm was against the public interest .
against public interest the director general of the oft , john vickers , said : " this is excellent news for consumers who will now benefit from lower and more competitive prices for common household medicines , " but the outcome has been condemned as a " devastating blow " to britain 's pharmacies by cpag 's chairman and community chemist , david sharpe .
" many pharmacists will simply not be able to survive given the buying power and aggressive pricing tactics of the supermarkets , " mr sharpe said .
" we continue to believe that we have a strong case and that many pharmacists rely on rpm to stay in business .
however , having been given the clear indication that we are unlikely to win , it is in no one 's interest to continue incurring further costs , " he added .
the case was brought to the high court last october by the oft .
a spokesman for boots said he was " disappointed " with the court 's decision and estimated the move will knock £ 15m off full year profits .
shares in boots , the biggest chain of pharmacies in the uk , fell 4.5 % on the news .

health professionals made the call after official figures showed that cases of the sexually transmitted disease soared by 75 % in the past five years chlamydia infection can cause infertility , serious gynaecological problems and possibly cancer if it is not treated .
latest figures show that the number of cases of genital chlamydia in the uk has soared from 32,371 in 1995 to 56,855 in 1999 .
dr sheila logan : " life ruining complications " annual treatment of the infection costs the nhs up to £ 100m a year .
it can be spread rapidly because most sufferers show no symptoms , and are not aware that they have been infected .
if detected early , it can be treated with antibiotics .
but long-term complications include ectopic pregnancy , infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease .
an investigation by bbc scotland 's frontline programme , to be screened on tuesday 15 may , revealed that most health authorities lack sufficient resources to operate comprehensive detection schemes .
dr sheila logan of aberdeen royal infirmary said : " it 's frightening to think that a lot of women who are sexually active and believe themselves to be healthy are wandering around with this infection , which can have both life threatening and life ruining complications . "
the programme shows that diagnosis is coming too late for an increasing number of women infected with chlamydia .
dr carolyn thompson : " testing has n't received top priority " one sufferer , who remains anonymous , told frontline : " i had to think about going on the ivf list for the future , if i wanted to have children . "
genito-urinary consultant , dr carolyn thompson , said that many health authorities in scotland still use an out-of-date swab test to diagnose the disease .
this method results in around one third of all potentially positive results being missed .
dr thompson said : " i 've put forward a case for testing but it has to go along with breast unit , stroke unit -lrb- funding -rrb- at the moment and chlamydia testing has n't received top priority . "
a spokeswoman from the scottish executive said action was being taken to improve the country 's sexual health .
she said : " " the lothian-based national health demonstration project , healthy respect , in which we are investing £ 3m , is acting as a test-bad for national action on sexual health .
" it will pilot chlamydia testing to help achieve its headline target to increase the reported prevalence of chlamydia among young people by 2003 , followed by a 50 % decrease in reported prevalence by 2010 . "

an investigation by bbc scotland 's frontline programme , to be screened on tuesday 15 may , revealed that most health authorities lack sufficient resources to operate comprehensive detection schemes .
dr sheila logan of aberdeen royal infirmary said : " it 's frightening to think that a lot of women who are sexually active and believe themselves to be healthy are wandering around with this infection , which can have both life threatening and life ruining complications . "
the programme shows that diagnosis is coming too late for an increasing number of women infected with chlamydia .
one sufferer , who remains anonymous , told frontline : " i had to think about going on the ivf list for the future , if i wanted to have children . "
genito-urinary consultant , dr carolyn thompson , said that many health authorities in scotland still use an out-of-date swab test to diagnose the disease .
this method results in around one third of all potentially positive results being missed .
dr thompson said : " i 've put forward a case for testing but it has to go along with breast unit , stroke unit -lrb- funding -rrb- at the moment and chlamydia testing has n't received top priority . "
a spokeswoman from the scottish executive said action was being taken to improve the country 's sexual health .
she said : " " the lothian-based national health demonstration project , healthy respect , in which we are investing £ 3m , is acting as a test-bad for national action on sexual health .
" it will pilot chlamydia testing to help achieve its headline target to increase the reported prevalence of chlamydia among young people by 2003 , followed by a 50 % decrease in reported prevalence by 2010 . "

state results assam congress 69 agp-bjp : 42 kerala congress + : 99 left : 40 pondicherry congress : 13 dmk : 12 tamil nadu aiadmk + : 196 dmk + : 36 west bengal left front : 200 trinamool + : 87 the party 's declining political fortunes appear to have magically revived almost overnight .
the congress is in the happy position of forming governments in kerala , assam and pondicherry and can bask in the reflected glory of the landslide victory of its ally aiadmk in tamil nadu .
even the defeat of the congress-trinamool congress alliance by the left front in west bengal may turn out to be a blessing in disguise .
with trinamool congress supremo mamata bannerjee - an inveterate foe of the left - badly discredited by her poll debacle , sonia gandhi is now far more free to join hands with the communists and other opposition parties to launch a combined assault against the vajpayee government in delhi .
no hurry however , neither the congress nor the left appear to be in any hurry to destabilise the bjp-led coalition government at the centre .
although clearly happy at the discomfiture of the vajpayee administration over the disastrous electoral performance of the bjp and its allies , sonia gandhi and leaders of the left front do not want to make the same mistake they did three years ago .
in 1998 , shortly after a similar string of victories in state assembly polls , the congress was emboldened to join hands with the left and other opposition parties to bring down the vajpayee government and stake their claim to form an alternative regime .
what they did was precipitate a mid-term poll in which the congress slumped to a record low and the bjp-led alliance romped home with a comfortable majority .
sonia gandhi herself was blamed for the hasty and untimely coup and had lost considerable clout within the congress as well as in the public eye .
consolidation not surprisingly , at the moment she is happy to consolidate her authority over congress and give the government a long rope to hang itself .
this means that while the congress along with the rest of the opposition is likely to step up its attacks on the government - particularly over the tehelka.com arms bribery scandal - it is not going to attempt any hasty toppling game in parliament .
many senior congress leaders feel that the right time to strike would be next year when the bjp faces a crucial poll in its bastion of uttar pradesh , the country 's largest state .
the loss of uttar pradesh - which most political pundits and pollsters are predicting - may well be the last nail in the coffin of the tarnished vajpayee government .

a democrat senator , patrick leahy , said that despite the allocation of more than $ 1bn in the plan , the results so far had been insignificant as ever larger amounts of cocaine were being smuggled into the us .
we 're spending an awful lot of money with wonderful intentions .
but the results are still negligible senator patrick leahy the american secretary of state , colin powell , defended the government strategy , but he admitted that more had to be done to reduce the demand for the drug .
he also denied that the us is supporting paramilitary groups , and said the colombian authorities had to show their commitment towards human rights in the anti-drugs efforts .
at an earlier hearing in the senate , us coast guard commander admiral james loy said that while seizures of drugs had increased markedly last year , their flow increased even more .
the service was unable to meet its target of a 13 % seizure rate , he added .
mr loy said that coast guard vessels were unable to keep pace with the faster boats now used by traffickers .
' worthwhile investment ' mr powell defended the us decision to allocate over $ 800m to combat trafficking in colombia and neighbouring countries .
us funds have gone towards training colombian troops the funds are in addition to $ 1.3bn already provided for plan colombia .
the new programme calls for promoting alternative crops , improving infrastructure , fighting corruption and strengthening democracy in colombia , ecuador , peru , bolivia , brazil and venezuela .
" i think we can make a case that this is a worthwhile investment in our overall drug strategy but also in our overall development strategy , " mr powell said .
but mr leahy was sceptical : " i see it more as a case where we 're spending an awful lot of money with wonderful intentions ... , " he said .
" but the results are still , i believe , negligible . "
other senators expressed concern that the defence department was planning to reduce its role in the drugs war .
iowa republican chuck grassley said that he was anxious to hear the results of a pentagon strategy review ordered by defence secretary donald rumsfeld , following " rumblings of ... desire to reduce their involvement " .

a confederation of british industry report published on wednesday shows that only greater london has higher levels of absence from work .
the problem is putting a huge strain on the local economy - with public sector absenteeism alone costing £ 250m a year .
workers in northern ireland take 11 days a year compared to an average of under eight across the united kingdom .
draining public purse but when the public service is put under the microscope , the scale of the problem becomes clear .
it is inevitable that such a level of absence from work has far-reaching effects on the local economy liam mcbrinn nigel smyth , director of the cbi in northern ireland , said absenteeism was draining the public purse of £ 250m every year .
he believes £ 50m of that could easily be saved if more was done to improve workplace morale .
liam mcbrinn of the health and safety executive for northern ireland said 50,000 people were absent from work each year suffering from work-related ill-health .
" in addition to the enormous personal suffering that must lie behind this statistic , it is inevitable that such a level of absence from work has far-reaching effects on the local economy , " he said .
" latest estimates indicate that it could be costing somewhere in the region of £ 300m . "
partnership the health and safety executive has established an occupational health forum for northern ireland .
" work can make significant contributions both good and bad to people 's health , " said mr mcbrinn .
" partnership is the key to ensuring that the issues surrounding occupational health are tackled positively so that the benefits of healthier workplaces are maximised for all . "
willie carville of the teachers ' union , the nasuwt , said about 170,000 working days were lost through illness in schools each year .
mr carville said more teachers were now getting out of the profession early than ever before .
he said a change for the worse had taken place in society 's attitude to teaching .
patten report however , while levels of absenteeism in teaching are bad , those in the royal ulster constabulary are even worse .
currently more than two-and-a-half times the uk average , sick leave in the police has risen dramatically since the patten report and moves to reform the force .
the average officer now takes more than 20 days off a year .
it is something that is causing grave concern within the police authority for northern ireland .
authority chairman pat armstrong said current attendance levels could not be tolerated - even in a climate of diminishing morale .
one of the ways ruc chief constable sir ronnie flanagan plans to tackle poor attendance is to block promotion for officers with a bad record .
this has reportedly caused some resentment within the rank and file but pat armstrong said their opposition was not shared by the general public and he wanted the pressure kept up .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- profile : poland 's last communist leader low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 16 may , 2001 , 08:35 gmt 09:35 uk profile : poland 's last communist leader jaruzelski rose through party ranks to become leader by central europe analyst jan repa poland 's last communist leader , wojciech jaruzelski , who has gone on trial in warsaw over the deaths of 44 strikers in 1970 , is better known as the man who imposed martial law more than a decade later .
the proclamation , on 13 december 1981 , was an attempt to suppress the solidarity movement .
jaruzelski was already leader of the polish communist party , prime minister and minister of defence .
he would become head of the military council of national salvation and polish president .
for some poles - particularly the " solidarity generation " - he is little short of a traitor now a frail 77-year old , jaruzelski has lived quietly since the collapse of communism - writing memoirs , polishing his image as a patriot and gentleman , and trying to stay out of jail .
like much of communist poland , jaruzelski 's own personal record is obscured and open to different interpretations .
what we do know about jaruzelski 's career runs roughly as follows .
forced labour born into a polish gentry family in 1923 , jaruzelski and his parents were deported into the depths of the soviet union , along with around a million other poles , following the nazi-soviet invasion of poland in 1939 .
he was orphaned , and became a forced labourer - permanently damaging his back and eyes .
drafted into the polish army units being formed under soviet command , he ended the second world war as a lieutenant - and then participated , under soviet direction , in the ruthless suppression of the polish wartime resistance movement .
public opinion in poland is now divided on jaruzelski however , jaruzelski 's career really took off after the departure in 1956 of the soviet field marshal , konstantin rokossovsky , who had been installed by stalin as poland 's commander in chief and minister of defence .
jaruzelski became the chief " political officer " of the polish armed forces in 1960 , chief of staff in 1964 ; and defence minister in 1968 .
in 1971 , a year after the baltic shootings for which he is now being tried , he became a full member of the communist party politburo .
polish public opinion remains deeply divided about jaruzelski .
' lesser evil ' for some - particularly the " solidarity generation " - he is little short of a traitor .
opinion polls , however , suggest that a majority of poles today are prepared to accept jaruzelski 's explanation of martial law as the " lesser evil " - intended to prevent a soviet invasion .
earlier attempts to put jaruzelski on trial - whether for 1970 or 1981 - have been frustrated by lengthy legal wrangles and jaruzelski 's own alleged poor health .
the present trial is scheduled last at least a year , with several hundred witnesses due to be called .
whether it will bring poles to a clearer understanding of their post-war history is unclear .

tarun gogoi , who has been chosen by congress party legislators as their new chief minister , said it was essential that peace returned to the troubled state .
i would like to send out a clear message to the militants that my government is keen on a political solutio assam chief minister tarun gogoi " solving the insurgency problem will top my government 's agenda .
without peace , the state will continue to be economically stagnant , " reports quoted mr gogoi as saying .
congress won the assam state elections held last week , defeating the incumbent asom gana parishad and its alliance partner , the bjp .
assam was hit by separatist violence in the run-up to the polls , which claimed the lives of more than 20 people , including a candidate of the bjp .
mr gogoi said the constant violence - by the separatists as well as the security forces - had left a psychological scar on the assamese .
he said he would approach the federal government in delhi to consider a unilateral ceasefire against the separatists , similar to one in place in kashmir .
" i would like to send out a clear message to the militants that my government is keen on a political solution to the insurgency problem , " mr gogoi said .
ground reality but during the election campaign , indian home minister lk advani ruled out a kashmir-style truce because the situation in the two states , he said , was totally different .
mr advani also said he was upset that the main rebel group - the united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- - had turned down an offer of unconditional dialogue .
correspondents say a ceasefire declaration by assam 's new administration is unlikely to be effective if delhi opposes it .
there are thousands of indian army and special forces troops operating in the state and it is not clear if they will honour a ceasefire that is not backed by the federal government .
assam has been hit by separatist violence for the past 20 years and more than 10,000 people have died during this period .

the bid at sotheby 's in new york set a new record for work by the artist jeff koons beating his previous high of $ 1.8m -lrb- £ 1.3m -rrb- .
koons ' piece was created in 1988 from porcelain and shows the superstar reclining with his arm around the monkey .
it was created from a publicity photograph for koons ' banality series .
koons is a controversial figure in the art world , and his previous exhibitions have featured toys and balloons , as well as a giant topiary puppy outside the rockefeller centre in new york .
much of the american artist 's work is conceptualised by himself but created by skilled craftsmen .
a new record was also set for the artist gerhard richter with the oil painting drei kerzen reaching $ 5.4m -lrb- £ 3.8m -rrb- .
the top lot of the new york sale was jackson pollock 's black and white / number 6 , 1951 , which fetched $ 7.9m -lrb- $ 5.5m -rrb- .
the anonymous bid far exceeded the auction house 's high estimate of $ 4m -lrb- £ 2.8m -rrb- .
five works by andy warhol were also included in the sale taken from his 1970s series of silk-screens entitled ladies and gentlemen .
unsold warhol 's group of five campbell 's soup cans sold for $ 3.7m -lrb- £ 2.6m -rrb- works by ellsworth kelly , martin puryear and ellen gallagher also achieved record highs for the artists .
despite record bids for five of the contemporary artists in the sale a quarter of the lots failed to sell .
the total amount raised was $ 45.3m -lrb- £ 31.7m -rrb- .
sotheby 's senior vice president for contemporary art blamed the this on " an unstable economic climate " .
three sculptures by alexander calder remained unsold .

' ironic ' " jack was pure and he would n't have found this to be pure . "
collectors today in my experience are very public spirited people .
they are not the hoarders of the gilded age , the robber baron period chris coover , christie 's writer and critic herbert gold , who penned the book oebohemia about kerouac , agreed .
he said : " it 's ironic that kerouac died at 47 with $ 83 in his pocket and now the scroll is worth a million or a million and a half . "
but fears that such an important work such as this will end up in another safe unseen for years are dismissed by christie 's chris coover .
he said : " collectors today in my experience are very public spirited people .
they are not the hoarders of the gilded age , the robber baron period .
" when they own a great thing they tend to loan it , exhibit it , share it and have it studied by scholars .
" i am sure that 's going to be the case with the one the road scroll . "

police officers are being stationed at secondary schools in one of london 's boroughs where crime has been a persistent problem .
southwark in south london was the scene of the murder of 10-year-old damilola taylor last november .
it is hoped the police presence will deter crime in schools and make it easier for vulnerable young people to report offences .
a metropolitan police spokeswoman said the scheme did not represent a step towards american-style school security , but hoped that it would break down the " wall of silence " that surrounded so much crime in and around schools .
is it a good idea ?
will it help to break down barriers in communities ?

your reaction the next step will be policemen in every home to make sure we behave ourselves in a fashion that they deem ' acceptable ' .
state influence in our lives is already too great - we should be reducing it , not increasing it .
mark b , england what has changed to make this idea now necessary ?
oli , london , england what has changed to make this idea now necessary ?
why are kids becoming less and less controllable ?
why have teachers ' hands been tied in the manner they have ?
why do young people have so little respect for authority ?
do any of the politicians who have thought of this idea really wonder whether it will work , or is it just more sliding down a slippery slope , the end of which no one knows ?
until intelligent people in power can answer these questions we will have no solution to the problem , and will have to carry on introducing more and more ludicrous ideas , such as this , to stem the rising tide of violent crime in our society .
oli , london , england surely the problems are caused by the children that are n't in school .
should n't the police be out on the streets trying to tackle them instead of in school scaring the borderline troublemakers away from attending ?
james owen , uk it is a shame that it has come to this , but there is a need .
if i were a parent , i would not complain - the police are hardly going to cause trouble .
a heavy-handed approach is needed to protect our children ; they are our most precious asset .
a 10 year old was killed - surely that is a sign that police presence - however drastic it may seem - is required , so no one else has to pay for crime with their life .
better police than the situation they have in some usa schools - where all pupils must have see-through bags to prevent them bringing weapons into school .
it 's just a shame the police ca n't make the children work in the classroom as well .
as for the extra cost - well , maybe all the politicians will have to live up to their hollow promises of more police -lrb- nurses / teachers too -rrb- in order to cover the need .
this issue can not be ignored .
john hutchence , uk it 's a sad way for this country to go jacky , uk it 's a sad way for this country to go but policing schools may be the only answer .
at least that way the kids who are not into criminal activities but are actually there to learn could be protected from the ever-growing minority of thugs .
i expect the teachers would also feel more secure , as they must worry constantly about being attacked by these scum .
maybe they should have prison cells in the school where they could be locked up for while and let the decent kids get on with their education .
i also agree with others that the parents should be made more responsible for their offsprings ' thuggish behaviour .
how about giving them a " detention " ?
jacky , uk the main problem is that most school age criminals know they are so over-protected by the law that they are virtually untouchable .
unfortunately this is the flipside of the well-meaning efforts of child protection lobbies - the guilty derive immunity from the protection of the innocent .
bobby , uk crazy !
big brother is here to stay .
what a pitiful control-freaked , bunch of sheep we are .
who needs a general election ?
ask the cops !
john , uk if successive governments over the years had not eroded the powers of teachers in respect of punishing kids , there would not be the need for police officers to be stationed in schools .
but it 's a damn good idea ! !
rob elliott , kosovo what we need is an honest report into the causes of child violence veronique , uk what we need is an honest report into the causes of child violence , which we 'll find to be poverty , absent or non-existent fathers , and absent , overworked mothers .
out-of-control children are saying " your family structure is wrong " .
we need to address this problem through family education , better benefits , and the revival of some sort of structure to explain that when you choose to have kids , you need to think through how both of you are going to provide male support to the household , because that male support is key to children .
i am not advocating for people to stay in marriages that do n't work , i am advocating for males in particular to be in no doubt as to what their influence and impact on the kid is and to make sure - whatever personal choice they make - that the kid they 've created is ok with it .
that means spending time with them , and more time and still more time , i am afraid .
veronique , uk no .
the very presence of police in schools makes students / pupils suspicious of one another , even if the police do n't do anything .
this is the voice of personal experience talking .
peter bolton , uk in us in my old high school recently a teacher was pistol whipped by a student .
most teenagers now carry weapons on them as freely as i carry my mobile phone , for these reasons .
the idea to put police into troublesome schools is a brilliant one but i feel it will never work because children now have no respect for authority figures .
becki lawrence , london , uk the issue of putting police in your schools has long been a salient issue for us in the united states .
i believe that what this indicates is a breakdown of the tradition nuclear family structure .
increasing violence and crime in your schools is merely a symptom of a deeper underlying social disease - something americans have been dealing with for some time now , but which is increasingly taking root in other areas of the world .
as an american , my idea would be to punish the parents of kids who misbehave , because they are obviously not parenting correctly .
putting big brother in control is not the answer .
you people in england are making the same mistake as the americans : trying to cure the symptoms , and not the root cause of the problem .
if police help to stem the wave of violence and crime , then good for that , but what a way to live for a kid .
william coler , united states the idea of bringing the police into schools is effectively outsourcing the keeping of order to a different public service james , uk the idea of bringing the police into schools is effectively outsourcing the keeping of order to a different public service now that teachers find themselves increasingly hampered in such things .
as long as the police do the job well enough , it should n't make any difference to the children whether the people who are keeping them in check happen to wear a different uniform to those who are trying to teach them long division .
james , uk i believe a police presence is warranted , but only as a stop-gap measure .
however , all that crime does n't just evaporate in the presence of cops , it just shifts to other , less conspicuous areas .
if you want to eliminate crime , stop reacting to its symptoms , and focus on eliminating its source : poverty , lack of education , mental illness , boredom , etc ..
focus on prevention , not punishment .
teach kids to respect each other , do n't tolerate ignorance and abuse by passing it off as " children just being children " .
edward nemil , usa i 'm very concerned about violence at schools and have realised that it is a problem not just in my country .
the same situations take place in argentina , the us and in many countries all over the world .
i think that violence has something to do with the lack of family relationships and poor communication .
marcelo gallo herrán , mendoza , argentina it seems that britain is destined to follow the example of schools in america .
suzanne mcmillan , japan -lrb- uk -rrb- it makes me wonder what this country is coming to steve fuller , england with police officers being stationed in some schools in a london borough , it makes me wonder what this country is coming to .
this is the result when you have too many ' do-gooders ' telling headteachers how to run our schools .
steve fuller , england i do n't know whether it will break down barriers , but it may save some lives .
james castro , usa we have multiple cctv cameras in our school .
we went home for the easter holidays and one was missing .
wonder where it went ?
si , uk what an excellent idea to station police officers at schools , but , so long as police officers are stationed at hospitals , old people 's homes , in fact why not have a police officer stationed in every street in the uk ?
now that is what i call community safety , but lets not get carried away with silly ideas , lets make parents responsible for their children 's behaviour just like they do in most of the eu countries .
if you are to be a parent examine the responsibility of being one beforehand .
lets us not rely on the police , teachers or politicians to educate our children who are the adults of the future r. ferreira , uk was damilola killed inside the school ?
put the police on our streets and forget the school gate .
a policeman at the school would n't have prevented the killing of damilola but a policeman on the street may have prevented it .
andy , middlesex , england police already come to schools to give road safety , drugs and other safety talks .
bringing them in may even help " crime fringe " pupils to appreciate their community value , and not regard them as " the enemy . "
phil w , uk - currently in the usa what we all need is more responsible parenting paul b , uk a tragic idea .
i am a parent and it is my responsibility to bring up my children to be decent human beings .
it is not the responsibility of the police or schools .
what we all need is more responsible parenting .
we brought the children into the world and we own it to them to provide the best basic training for life - respect for themselves and others .
paul b , uk to all those saying bring back the cane ; these days any teacher attempting to cane someone who 's earned it will probably end up in hospital .
i 'd say it 's a damning indictment of our society that policing is required in our schools at all .
frankly , the budding thugs terrorising our schools have denied themselves the right to a civilised education and should be sent to an old fashioned army boot camp to attain an education on terms they can comprehend - namely cause and effect - a taste of their own medicine would do no harm at all .
henban , uk as a serving officer , i know most of us sent to schools have our own kids , and have the skills to deal with small kids effectively .
i 'm sorry to note some contributors see fit to accuse us all of arrogance , stupidity and incompetence , probably without ever having met more than a couple of us .
is n't that the same mass stereotyping that we always get accused of ?
besides - when the dealers are outside your school , selling heroin to your kids , getting them into burglary and prostitution to pay for it , wo n't you actually want us there ?
try joining the specials , see what the problem is really like and actually do something about it yourself , do n't just bleat on here !
nick hogarth , uk to be honest i do n't think some of the young thugs in these schools will care too much whether there 's one policeman on the front gates or an entire patrol .
if they show little or no respect to their own parents , teachers , general public et al , i 'm pretty sure they will cock a snook at the police because , let 's face it , what can the law do to these people ?
there have been so many instances where teenage -lrb- and pre-teen -rrb- burglars have been arrested many , many times over but are set free because there is very little the law can actually do !
toughen up the laws , make justice fair and show a bit more discipline and we might get some results .
russell o , birmingham , uk give kids guidance and teach them respect for others jenni , bristol , england parents and teachers have failed their children and the law has to try and put things right .
so what 's new ?
give kids guidance and teach them respect for others and their community from the start and maybe the whole of society will benefit .
jenni , bristol , england i have yet to meet a cultured or intelligent policeman , so let 's hope they can learn something while they 're back in school .
maybe the teachers could lay on some lessons in ' manners and humility ' too ?
dennis , uk they should never have done away with the ' cane ' , it never did me any harm or any of the people that i went to school with .
i say , bring it back .
meg webb , usa / england the police force is spread too thinly over a wide area already colin holloway , england much as i support the idea of a policeman in every playground , will this be the policeman who was on every street corner protecting the rest of the general public ?
the police force is spread too thinly over a wide area already , so unless there 's another big recruitment drive imminent i ca n't help but feel that the " playground copper " will soon be at an end , once the political gimmick has worn off !
colin holloway , england the more important area for progress is the building of rapport between the school students and police in the local area .
a police liaison attends our school regularly to present programmes for the students .
when issues arise that need the support of the police , they will come and speak with those students who need to understand the law .
when there are celebrations in the school , the liaison officer will be present .
far more important to have police presence about the school in a positive manner than in the threatening and posturing manner of a ' cop on the beat ! '
stephen , canada it 's about time violence in schools was recognised for what it is - criminal activity .
a teacher 's primary role is to educate , not to control or rehabilitate those who have contempt for morality and responsibility .
the role of the police is to protect society and , whilst a reluctant admission , our children need that protection even in school .
j l , uk the way many youngsters behave nowadays , i think authority is sadly lacking and yes , it would certainly be a good idea to have police patrolling the schools .
in fact i think youth clubs should be adjacent to police stations and the old law of two 's company , three 's a crowd reintroduced to thwart street gangs .
p. hewitt , uk i feel that children should be given a free life to lead alison rowe , scotland , uk the school which i currently attend is a secondary school and it is already being turned into a prison camp .
it is not a bad area and there are no problems within the community .
i feel that children should be given a free life to lead .
in my school they have id badges and anyone not wearing one can be questioned by anyone with one to determine who they are .
i think that by putting police officers in school will only make everyone feel more insecure than what they already are .
alison rowe , scotland , uk the biggest mistake the uk government did was to outlaw caning in the public school system .
its results have been dire , thus you want to turn the uk education system into a us one where the police are involved in the daily lives of the students .
rt , kenyan in the us this is treating the symptom , not the disease .
the problem will not be licked until a way is found of instilling into all youngsters , and older people too , a proper code of conduct , concern for the well being of other members of the community and respect for public and private property .
brian w , uk probably cheaper than teachers , after the last pay round .
guy chapman , uk bring back the cane - did the job at my school !
mark , uk police in schools , police state .
nothing more needs to be said .
david moran , australia / scotland given the levels of institutionalised stupidity amongst the police , i doubt it would succeed .
ross farrell , gb i think it could work in some schools in deprived areas but it would require a police officer to be highly diplomatic and intelligent .
given the levels of institutionalised stupidity amongst the police , i doubt it would succeed .
ross farrell , gb i 'm a tad ambivalent about this but i think it 's significant that few of the poo-pooers offer any alternative proposals other than some woolly half-thought ideas .
i say we give it a go , using all the experiences we can muster -lrb- yes , even american ones ! -rrb- but be prepared to learn and adjust .
alex w , uk i felt i had to respond to neil pearce who is concerned that the police will stand at the school gates and use speed cameras .
hopefully they will !
speeding past a school and parking illegally outside schools is a major threat to the safety of our children .
police should do everything in their power to stop this .
i suppose mr pearce is one of those who thinks that the police should stop ' harassing ' drivers doing 100mph plus on motorways instead of concentrating on ' real ' criminals .
grow up mr pearce - and let our children do the same , safely .
kevin , uk the problem lies not with the need for additional costly policing , but strict government policy to curb and punish the offenders .
the inability of the law to curb disorder leads to total disillusionment in the police .
and only leads to a free for all for all those who wish to break the law .
j moffat , uk yet another crazy idea from cranky britain steven charlesworth , england yet another crazy idea from cranky britain .
if kids were disciplined and taught to respect authority in schools instead of being allowed to run rampage there would not be a need for all this nonsense .
and where are all these policemen going to come from ?
steven charlesworth , england a police / security presence in schools does not necessarily prevent tragedy .
such stringent measures would not be necessary if society had not abdicated its role in teaching children right from wrong and insisting on standards of behaviour .
this is a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has run off .
there will always be members of society who will seek to circumvent the rules and will see this as a challenge .
do something about the thug element in schools and allow the children who want to learn , to do so in a comfortable environment free from aggression and threat .
this is not the long-term solution and is a quick fix .
di stewart , usa as a teacher in the usa and a frequent visitor to great britain ... i believe police in schools will make a world of difference over there .
we have an officer at our school here and it has helped on several fronts .
one , the students have someone to go to when there is a crisis , such as threats of violence and things of that nature .
secondly , just the mere presence of an officer in our school has deterred crime quite a bit and other unruly behaviour .
believe me just having an officer in the schools will make children think twice about many things .
forest issac jones , usa you are on to a winning idea michael gahan , ireland a great idea , perhaps this will allow children to get to know their local officers well , promote more respect for the police forces -lrb- especially when they get older -rrb- , and make them more comfortable around police officers which in turn makes it easier to turn to them with concerns .
add this to the obvious extra protection afforded to children and you are on to a winning idea .
michael gahan , ireland i think that it is to be commended that the metropolitan police service are taking action to stop crime and violence in school .
i do however agree that they are blind to the fact that this could lead to the introduction of the us style security in school .
i do not , however , disagree with the us method as it has proved very successful and if it can prevent another death such as damilola taylor , then it has to be worth a try .
nick , uk i am a deputy sheriff assigned to a high school in florida .
i have been a school resource officer for six years now .
i love my job and i have found it is a great way to build a rapport with kids .
i teach classes , counsel students , sponsor a club for surfers , and handle any crisis on campus .
it takes a special officer to work in a school setting , and i believe it will help break down barriers in the united kingdom as it has in the united states .
bo strange , usa and what is to happen " outside " the school grounds when people from ethnic minorities are targeted on the streets ?
what we need here is not to create " fear " but educate .
until we educate our children on tolerance and acceptance no amount of armed forces can make an iota of difference .
ayesha , uk i think the kids of today need every bit of protection they can get .
i believe a lot of children suffer in silence in fear of being victimised should they report any form of crime .
the presence of police in schools is probably the most effective way of stopping any future violence , drugs , bullying etc .
it 's a shame , but this is the reality of the society in which we now live .
sha , uk schools are not jails - it is a learning institution and should be treated like one .
placing police in the schools is going to make the children feel bad about themselves .
to fix this problem the school system needs to develop a method that takes safety , respect and dignity into consideration when dealing with the future of tomorrow .
i am proud to be british and love the way we handle our own problems so lets not look to another country with worse problems for ideas .
shemeka stoddart , usa anything that can help prevent crime in schools has got to be commended lee , uk anything that can help prevent crime in schools has got to be commended .
this could go a long way towards cutting down on bullying as well as the drugs in school problem .
i know from speaking to my children that dealers actually come into the schools and shamelessly ply their sick trade .
i do n't think people realise just how much criminal activity takes place in and around schools .
i would like to see police at all schools and i 'm convinced it would not take long before the general public reaped the benefits .
lee , uk the police need to be seen as authority figures , not as everybody 's best friend .
the reason people did n't come forward with evidence about the murder of damilola is because they were afraid of the criminals , not because they were afraid of the police .
people will be less afraid of criminals when the police are seen as efficient and empowered rather than matey .
khan , uk no doubt they 'll spend the majority of their time at standing at the school gates with speed cameras and enforcing on the spot fines for any crisp packets dropped during playtime .
neil pearce , england it sounds like the metropolitan police are in denial towards ' american-style school security ' because it certainly sounds like that is the course uk schools are heading for .
rightly so , as violence amongst children in the uk seems on the rise .
several of my teaching friends have taught in the uk and they have never come across such badly behaved , unruly kids than they did when teaching in london , compared to what they were used to in australia .
natalie , australia it 's a gross over-reaction andrew cover , uk this is a bad idea .
it 's a way of being seen to be doing something to tackle a problem that is not as serious as this idea suggests and in any case can be dealt with by more effective use of existing law enforcement measures .
it 's a gross over-reaction that in fact is a damaging move as it will generate fear and a sense of things being worse than they actually are .
andrew cover , uk it 's a brilliant way to spy on households via their children .
p , uk placing police in schools is an excellent idea .
the standards of civil decency and respect for society is on a sorry path of degeneration amongst the british youth .
rahul mahajan , uk having police officers so close to children on a day to day basis could well help make the next generation of adults more responsible .
it would also show ' out of control ' children that choosing crime is for the cowardly , weak and idle and that they can have a successful and happy life doing things the right way .
this is , of course , assuming there is little interference from those wishy washy liberals who feel that crime is just a child 's way of ' expressing themselves ' !

as an american , my idea would be to punish the parents of kids who misbehave , because they are obviously not parenting correctly .
putting big brother in control is not the answer .
you people in england are making the same mistake as the americans : trying to cure the symptoms , and not the root cause of the problem .
if police help to stem the wave of violence and crime , then good for that , but what a way to live for a kid .
william coler , united states the idea of bringing the police into schools is effectively outsourcing the keeping of order to a different public service james , uk the idea of bringing the police into schools is effectively outsourcing the keeping of order to a different public service now that teachers find themselves increasingly hampered in such things .
as long as the police do the job well enough , it should n't make any difference to the children whether the people who are keeping them in check happen to wear a different uniform to those who are trying to teach them long division .
james , uk i believe a police presence is warranted , but only as a stop-gap measure .
however , all that crime does n't just evaporate in the presence of cops , it just shifts to other , less conspicuous areas .
if you want to eliminate crime , stop reacting to its symptoms , and focus on eliminating its source : poverty , lack of education , mental illness , boredom , etc ..
focus on prevention , not punishment .
teach kids to respect each other , do n't tolerate ignorance and abuse by passing it off as " children just being children " .
edward nemil , usa i 'm very concerned about violence at schools and have realised that it is a problem not just in my country .
the same situations take place in argentina , the us and in many countries all over the world .
i think that violence has something to do with the lack of family relationships and poor communication .
marcelo gallo herrán , mendoza , argentina it seems that britain is destined to follow the example of schools in america .
suzanne mcmillan , japan -lrb- uk -rrb- it makes me wonder what this country is coming to steve fuller , england with police officers being stationed in some schools in a london borough , it makes me wonder what this country is coming to .
this is the result when you have too many ' do-gooders ' telling headteachers how to run our schools .
steve fuller , england i do n't know whether it will break down barriers , but it may save some lives .
james castro , usa we have multiple cctv cameras in our school .
we went home for the easter holidays and one was missing .
wonder where it went ?
si , uk what an excellent idea to station police officers at schools , but , so long as police officers are stationed at hospitals , old people 's homes , in fact why not have a police officer stationed in every street in the uk ?
now that is what i call community safety , but lets not get carried away with silly ideas , lets make parents responsible for their children 's behaviour just like they do in most of the eu countries .
if you are to be a parent examine the responsibility of being one beforehand .
lets us not rely on the police , teachers or politicians to educate our children who are the adults of the future r. ferreira , uk was damilola killed inside the school ?
put the police on our streets and forget the school gate .
a policeman at the school would n't have prevented the killing of damilola but a policeman on the street may have prevented it .
andy , middlesex , england police already come to schools to give road safety , drugs and other safety talks .
bringing them in may even help " crime fringe " pupils to appreciate their community value , and not regard them as " the enemy . "
phil w , uk - currently in the usa what we all need is more responsible parenting paul b , uk a tragic idea .
i am a parent and it is my responsibility to bring up my children to be decent human beings .
it is not the responsibility of the police or schools .
what we all need is more responsible parenting .
we brought the children into the world and we own it to them to provide the best basic training for life - respect for themselves and others .
paul b , uk to all those saying bring back the cane ; these days any teacher attempting to cane someone who 's earned it will probably end up in hospital .
i 'd say it 's a damning indictment of our society that policing is required in our schools at all .
frankly , the budding thugs terrorising our schools have denied themselves the right to a civilised education and should be sent to an old fashioned army boot camp to attain an education on terms they can comprehend - namely cause and effect - a taste of their own medicine would do no harm at all .
henban , uk as a serving officer , i know most of us sent to schools have our own kids , and have the skills to deal with small kids effectively .
i 'm sorry to note some contributors see fit to accuse us all of arrogance , stupidity and incompetence , probably without ever having met more than a couple of us .
is n't that the same mass stereotyping that we always get accused of ?
besides - when the dealers are outside your school , selling heroin to your kids , getting them into burglary and prostitution to pay for it , wo n't you actually want us there ?
try joining the specials , see what the problem is really like and actually do something about it yourself , do n't just bleat on here !
nick hogarth , uk to be honest i do n't think some of the young thugs in these schools will care too much whether there 's one policeman on the front gates or an entire patrol .
if they show little or no respect to their own parents , teachers , general public et al , i 'm pretty sure they will cock a snook at the police because , let 's face it , what can the law do to these people ?
there have been so many instances where teenage -lrb- and pre-teen -rrb- burglars have been arrested many , many times over but are set free because there is very little the law can actually do !
toughen up the laws , make justice fair and show a bit more discipline and we might get some results .
russell o , birmingham , uk give kids guidance and teach them respect for others jenni , bristol , england parents and teachers have failed their children and the law has to try and put things right .
so what 's new ?
give kids guidance and teach them respect for others and their community from the start and maybe the whole of society will benefit .
jenni , bristol , england i have yet to meet a cultured or intelligent policeman , so let 's hope they can learn something while they 're back in school .
maybe the teachers could lay on some lessons in ' manners and humility ' too ?
dennis , uk they should never have done away with the ' cane ' , it never did me any harm or any of the people that i went to school with .
i say , bring it back .
meg webb , usa / england the police force is spread too thinly over a wide area already colin holloway , england much as i support the idea of a policeman in every playground , will this be the policeman who was on every street corner protecting the rest of the general public ?
the police force is spread too thinly over a wide area already , so unless there 's another big recruitment drive imminent i ca n't help but feel that the " playground copper " will soon be at an end , once the political gimmick has worn off !
colin holloway , england the more important area for progress is the building of rapport between the school students and police in the local area .
a police liaison attends our school regularly to present programmes for the students .
when issues arise that need the support of the police , they will come and speak with those students who need to understand the law .
when there are celebrations in the school , the liaison officer will be present .
far more important to have police presence about the school in a positive manner than in the threatening and posturing manner of a ' cop on the beat ! '
stephen , canada it 's about time violence in schools was recognised for what it is - criminal activity .
a teacher 's primary role is to educate , not to control or rehabilitate those who have contempt for morality and responsibility .
the role of the police is to protect society and , whilst a reluctant admission , our children need that protection even in school .
j l , uk the way many youngsters behave nowadays , i think authority is sadly lacking and yes , it would certainly be a good idea to have police patrolling the schools .
in fact i think youth clubs should be adjacent to police stations and the old law of two 's company , three 's a crowd reintroduced to thwart street gangs .
p. hewitt , uk i feel that children should be given a free life to lead alison rowe , scotland , uk the school which i currently attend is a secondary school and it is already being turned into a prison camp .
it is not a bad area and there are no problems within the community .
i feel that children should be given a free life to lead .
in my school they have id badges and anyone not wearing one can be questioned by anyone with one to determine who they are .
i think that by putting police officers in school will only make everyone feel more insecure than what they already are .
alison rowe , scotland , uk the biggest mistake the uk government did was to outlaw caning in the public school system .
its results have been dire , thus you want to turn the uk education system into a us one where the police are involved in the daily lives of the students .
rt , kenyan in the us this is treating the symptom , not the disease .
the problem will not be licked until a way is found of instilling into all youngsters , and older people too , a proper code of conduct , concern for the well being of other members of the community and respect for public and private property .
brian w , uk probably cheaper than teachers , after the last pay round .
guy chapman , uk bring back the cane - did the job at my school !
mark , uk police in schools , police state .
nothing more needs to be said .
david moran , australia / scotland given the levels of institutionalised stupidity amongst the police , i doubt it would succeed .
ross farrell , gb i think it could work in some schools in deprived areas but it would require a police officer to be highly diplomatic and intelligent .
given the levels of institutionalised stupidity amongst the police , i doubt it would succeed .
ross farrell , gb i 'm a tad ambivalent about this but i think it 's significant that few of the poo-pooers offer any alternative proposals other than some woolly half-thought ideas .
i say we give it a go , using all the experiences we can muster -lrb- yes , even american ones ! -rrb- but be prepared to learn and adjust .
alex w , uk i felt i had to respond to neil pearce who is concerned that the police will stand at the school gates and use speed cameras .
hopefully they will !
speeding past a school and parking illegally outside schools is a major threat to the safety of our children .
police should do everything in their power to stop this .
i suppose mr pearce is one of those who thinks that the police should stop ' harassing ' drivers doing 100mph plus on motorways instead of concentrating on ' real ' criminals .
grow up mr pearce - and let our children do the same , safely .
kevin , uk the problem lies not with the need for additional costly policing , but strict government policy to curb and punish the offenders .
the inability of the law to curb disorder leads to total disillusionment in the police .
and only leads to a free for all for all those who wish to break the law .
j moffat , uk yet another crazy idea from cranky britain steven charlesworth , england yet another crazy idea from cranky britain .
if kids were disciplined and taught to respect authority in schools instead of being allowed to run rampage there would not be a need for all this nonsense .
and where are all these policemen going to come from ?
steven charlesworth , england a police / security presence in schools does not necessarily prevent tragedy .
such stringent measures would not be necessary if society had not abdicated its role in teaching children right from wrong and insisting on standards of behaviour .
this is a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has run off .
there will always be members of society who will seek to circumvent the rules and will see this as a challenge .
do something about the thug element in schools and allow the children who want to learn , to do so in a comfortable environment free from aggression and threat .
this is not the long-term solution and is a quick fix .
di stewart , usa as a teacher in the usa and a frequent visitor to great britain ... i believe police in schools will make a world of difference over there .
we have an officer at our school here and it has helped on several fronts .
one , the students have someone to go to when there is a crisis , such as threats of violence and things of that nature .
secondly , just the mere presence of an officer in our school has deterred crime quite a bit and other unruly behaviour .
believe me just having an officer in the schools will make children think twice about many things .
forest issac jones , usa you are on to a winning idea michael gahan , ireland a great idea , perhaps this will allow children to get to know their local officers well , promote more respect for the police forces -lrb- especially when they get older -rrb- , and make them more comfortable around police officers which in turn makes it easier to turn to them with concerns .
add this to the obvious extra protection afforded to children and you are on to a winning idea .
michael gahan , ireland i think that it is to be commended that the metropolitan police service are taking action to stop crime and violence in school .
i do however agree that they are blind to the fact that this could lead to the introduction of the us style security in school .
i do not , however , disagree with the us method as it has proved very successful and if it can prevent another death such as damilola taylor , then it has to be worth a try .
nick , uk i am a deputy sheriff assigned to a high school in florida .
i have been a school resource officer for six years now .
i love my job and i have found it is a great way to build a rapport with kids .
i teach classes , counsel students , sponsor a club for surfers , and handle any crisis on campus .
it takes a special officer to work in a school setting , and i believe it will help break down barriers in the united kingdom as it has in the united states .
bo strange , usa and what is to happen " outside " the school grounds when people from ethnic minorities are targeted on the streets ?
what we need here is not to create " fear " but educate .
until we educate our children on tolerance and acceptance no amount of armed forces can make an iota of difference .
ayesha , uk i think the kids of today need every bit of protection they can get .
i believe a lot of children suffer in silence in fear of being victimised should they report any form of crime .
the presence of police in schools is probably the most effective way of stopping any future violence , drugs , bullying etc .
it 's a shame , but this is the reality of the society in which we now live .
sha , uk schools are not jails - it is a learning institution and should be treated like one .
placing police in the schools is going to make the children feel bad about themselves .
to fix this problem the school system needs to develop a method that takes safety , respect and dignity into consideration when dealing with the future of tomorrow .
i am proud to be british and love the way we handle our own problems so lets not look to another country with worse problems for ideas .
shemeka stoddart , usa anything that can help prevent crime in schools has got to be commended lee , uk anything that can help prevent crime in schools has got to be commended .
this could go a long way towards cutting down on bullying as well as the drugs in school problem .
i know from speaking to my children that dealers actually come into the schools and shamelessly ply their sick trade .
i do n't think people realise just how much criminal activity takes place in and around schools .
i would like to see police at all schools and i 'm convinced it would not take long before the general public reaped the benefits .
lee , uk the police need to be seen as authority figures , not as everybody 's best friend .
the reason people did n't come forward with evidence about the murder of damilola is because they were afraid of the criminals , not because they were afraid of the police .
people will be less afraid of criminals when the police are seen as efficient and empowered rather than matey .
khan , uk no doubt they 'll spend the majority of their time at standing at the school gates with speed cameras and enforcing on the spot fines for any crisp packets dropped during playtime .
neil pearce , england it sounds like the metropolitan police are in denial towards ' american-style school security ' because it certainly sounds like that is the course uk schools are heading for .
rightly so , as violence amongst children in the uk seems on the rise .
several of my teaching friends have taught in the uk and they have never come across such badly behaved , unruly kids than they did when teaching in london , compared to what they were used to in australia .
natalie , australia it 's a gross over-reaction andrew cover , uk this is a bad idea .
it 's a way of being seen to be doing something to tackle a problem that is not as serious as this idea suggests and in any case can be dealt with by more effective use of existing law enforcement measures .
it 's a gross over-reaction that in fact is a damaging move as it will generate fear and a sense of things being worse than they actually are .
andrew cover , uk it 's a brilliant way to spy on households via their children .
p , uk placing police in schools is an excellent idea .
the standards of civil decency and respect for society is on a sorry path of degeneration amongst the british youth .
rahul mahajan , uk having police officers so close to children on a day to day basis could well help make the next generation of adults more responsible .
it would also show ' out of control ' children that choosing crime is for the cowardly , weak and idle and that they can have a successful and happy life doing things the right way .
this is , of course , assuming there is little interference from those wishy washy liberals who feel that crime is just a child 's way of ' expressing themselves ' !

the government will miss its target of getting 50 % of under-30s into university by 2010 without more help for lower income students .
its report on universities in england says many youngsters from poorer families are deciding not to go into higher education because of money worries .
while more students than ever are going to university , the proportion of those from lower social groups - about 28 % - has not changed since 1994 , the nao report found .
since the introduction of tuition fees and the replacement of maintenance grants with loans , graduates are now likely to leave university with debts of £ 10,000 to £ 16,000 .

the law faculty at oxford have recently reviewed their course .
they expect students to spend 45 hours a week studying .
it is also forbidden by several colleges to have jobs in term time .

there is also the fact that working for 15 hours a week would n't even cover the cost of my rent , and that 's in college accommodation .

the five-week-old animal had been kept in a garage while her health was monitored for signs of the disease .
but on wednesday morning a ministry of agriculture vet lifted the 21-day restriction .
the plight of the calf , who was found alive next to her dead mother five days after her herd was slaughtered , caused headlines around the world .
it is a little bit of good news for a change philip board farmer she was due to be put down , but a change in government policy meant she could be spared .
farm owner philip board , 42 , said it was " brilliant " that the quarantine had been lifted , adding : " it is a little bit of good news for a change . "
his wife michaela , 35 , said : " it is such a relief , and it is really nice to get back to normal . "
she said phoenix was now filling out and drinking four buckets of milk a day .
appeal for mercy phoenix had faced slaughter despite surviving a cull of 15 cattle and 30 sheep at the board 's farm in membury , devon .
she lay huddled next to her dead mother for five days before being discovered by maff officials who had come to disinfect the land .
the board family claimed she was healthy and appealed for her to be spared .
it is just nice to see phoenix healthy and happy michaela board the calf was granted a stay of execution after downing street announced it was relaxing the policy of culling animals on farms near to infected sites .
but maff put her under a 21-day quarantine and she was tested regularly before the threat of slaughter was lifted .
the policy shift came after phoenix 's picture appeared on the front page of some national newspapers , and farmers ' leaders claimed that killing the calf would " make king herod look like a humanitarian " .
cash cow since phoenix 's rise to fame , her owners have had offers for her services .
one company offered phoenix a pantomime role , appearing alongside shane ritchie in jack and the beanstalk .

as vote counting continued after monday 's elections , justice narciso nario decided to heed a police plea to reschedule mr estrada 's court appearance to 31 may .
estrada retains the support of many poor filipinos a police chief had told the court that estrada supporters could capitalise on the election mood to stir up street protests .
two weeks ago , there were violent protests outside the presidential palace , prompting president gloria arroyo to launch a crackdown on estrada supporters , accusing them of trying to overthrow her .
ms arroyo came to power through a popular uprising in january which ousted mr estrada .
the former film star , who remains popular with millions of poor filipinos , was arrested last month over charges of corruption .
he faces a further arraignment on 27 june for another , more serious charge of economic plunder , which is punishable by death .
senate race mrs arroyo 's coalition has taken a narrow lead in the crucial contest for the 13 senate seats .
with13 % of 30 million votes counted , it was leading in the race for seven seats , while opposition candidates led in five and an independent in another .
it will be weeks before all votes are tallied conclusive results are not expected for days , and final results for the more than 17,000 legislative and municipal seats will not be completed for several weeks .
ms arroyo is seeking a clear majority to bolster her position and silence her critics , to quell the political volatility of recent months .
violence vote counting in the last two days was disrupted in several areas of the country by violence , with two policemen and a campaign supporter among those killed .
the bloodshed prompted a senior catholic leader , archbishop orlando quevedo , to call for a re-evaluation of the entire electoral process .
in one incident , a policeman was killed when gunmen seized ballot boxes containing votes in two precincts of santa ana city in the extreme north of the country .
arroyo : looking to bolster her position and in the town of mayorja , a mayoral candidate , zemaida doria , was abducted by suspected communist rebels .
the military said they were investigating reports that 30 people had been abducted since the start of campaigning .
violence has often marred elections in a country where some political leaders help bolster their positions through private armies .
but this year 's campaign left nearly 100 people dead , according to some reports , making it one of the most violent since the 1986 snap election between ferdinand marcos and opposition leader corazon aquino , when 153 people were killed .

the report comes ahead of the first world coffee conference , a three-day gathering of leading figures in the industry in london , which begins on thursday .
oxfam fails to address the fundamental economics of the coffee market in the long term british coffee association oxfam is concerned at the growing disparity of wealth between different parts of the coffee industry , following a 60 % drop in the value of the crop on international commodity markets in the last three years .
the british coffee association has dismissed the report 's findings at " too short term . "
rich versus poor oxfam says that , in real terms , coffee prices are lower than they have ever been .
click here to see the biggest coffee producing countries this , it says , is having devastating consequences for poor farmers in coffee growing countries .
vulnerable at the best of times , oxfam says they now face a descent into extreme poverty , with serious consequences for health , education and social stability .
meanwhile , the charity says , big multinational food companies , cafe and restaurant chains in rich nations have gained enormously from the drop in prices .
the value of raw coffee beans has fallen sharply in the last three years due to overproduction , but prices paid for the processed product in consuming nations have remained much the same .
minimum wage oxfam says the price of raw coffee exported from producer countries accounts for less than 7 % of the eventual cost of coffee to western consumers - the rest , over 90 % , goes to coffee processors and retailers in rich countries .
oxfam cites increased profits at nestle , the giant swiss instant coffee processor , and the fashionable american coffee shop chain starbucks as evidence of its case .
it is calling for an internationally-agreed minimum coffee price of $ 1 per pound -lrb- 0.454kg -rrb- - about double the lowest current levels .
report rejected in its first reaction , the british coffee association -lrb- bca -rrb- said it shared oxfam 's concerns over low prices for producers .
however , the bca - which represents coffee manufactuers selling in the uk - says oxfam " fails to address the fundamental economics of the coffee market in the long term " .
" increasing prices of green coffee beans without implementing appropriate controls on production would not help the livelihood of the growers in producing countries in the longer term , " the bca argued in a press release .

the award-winning knitwear specialist from merthyr tydfil , in the south wales valleys , who sets out to sell " sex on legs " is renowned for revealing creations coveted by a-list celebrities .
air travel is a glamorous business and my aim is to create a uniform which reflects this julien macdonald and union officials are concerned that their members may be forced to wear unsuitably sexy outfits .
" uniforms should be functional , smart and presentable , " said a transport and general workers ' union spokesman .
" our members should not be dressed as sex objects and should be consulted on changes to their uniforms . "
kelly brook 's head-turning macdonald dress british airways have chosen macdonald - who boasts liz hurley , nicole kidman and joely richardson among his clients - to design the new outfits for pilots , cabin crew , and check-in staff in a bid to help promote its new image .
" julien 's vision for our new uniform reinforces the airline 's refreshed identity - classic , yet modern , stylish , but practical , " said the airline 's director of marketing , martin george .
earlier this year , the designer consolidated his reputation for sexy , feminine couture when he was appointed artistic director of the french fashion house givenchy .
soon after he was awarded one of the most prestigious accolades in fashion - the title of most glamorous designer of the year at london fashion week .
julien 's vision for our new uniform reinforces the airline 's refreshed identity - classic , yet modern , stylish , but practical martin george , british airways macdonald has said that he sets out to sell " sex on legs " and the skimpy dress he designed for dressing kelly brook for the snatch film premiere last year seemed to testify to that .
the dress , which was cut so high it showed her underwear , won the actress a prize for both best and worst outfit of 2000 in a poll of heat magazine readers .
but , in an effort to calm fears , macdonald has said he would meet as many ba staff as possible before finalising his designs .
" air travel is a glamorous business and my aim is to create a uniform which reflects this , " he said .
fans include actress joely richardson plans for the uniform were being kept secret but british airways said it expected staff to be wearing the new outfits by the end of 2002 .
the current red , white and blue uniforms , designed by dublin-born paul costelloe , have been worn for the past eight years .
rebranding is part of british airway 's strategy to restore flagging profits and reposition itself in an increasingly competitive market , particularly on transatlantic routes .
last month , the airline announced it would revert to carrying the blue , white and red colours of the union flag on the tailfins of its jets .
ethnic designs from around the world which replaced the flag in 1997 quickly proved unpopular .

although it is in competition at the festival , the film has already been released in america where it took a mediocre $ 20m -lrb- £ 14m -rrb- .
directed by penn , the pledge is nicholson 's first role since the oscar-winning as good as it gets and is the third film penn has directed .
it is in the running for the top prizes at the festival , with nicholson tipped by some to be named best actor .
penn described nicholson as " one of the greatest gifts in my life , in art and in the world " .
" i love jack nicholson , " he said before the screening .
" he 's the most deeply supportive artist one could hope to work with . "
nicholson plays a detective who finds it hard to retire after a child is brutally murdered .
penn also said he is not bitter about the lukewarm response from us audiences - but hopes it will go down better in europe .
" we hope it finds audiences who embrace it here , " he said .
" it 's important to me . "
but the director would not be drawn when he was asked if he was a fan of films made by guy ritchie , the husband of his former wife madonna .
he simply said : " a good movie is a good movie . "
the pledge also stars oscar-winner benicio del toro , british actress helen mirren and penn 's wife robin wright-penn .
but crimes in cannes are not confined to the screen .
a british director is offering a £ 100,000 -lrb- $ 143,000 -rrb- reward for the return of letters from screen legend marlon brando .
brando letters they were stolen while tony kaye , who made his name directing tv commercials , was asleep in his villa in the french town .
kaye 's spokesman said the director was woken by two men who refused to leave .
" eventually , he was forced to brandish a kitchen knife in order to chase them away .
it was very frightening , " he said .
kaye met brando after the godfather star advised him after a dispute with a hollywood studio .
' desperate ' a camera bag containing cash and film notes was also taken .
" he is not bothered about the money but it is desperate to have the letters from brando returned , " the spokesman said .
other events at the 12-day festival - which ends on 20 may - were described by the bbc 's rebecca jones as " absurd , preposterous , mad " .
after scenes of pigeon-eating actors being thrown off a beach , porn stars were ejected from a hotel 's private beach for causing chaos .
scantily-clad actresses had planned to use the noga hilton to promote some of their latest productions .
but the hotel manager jacky benayoun told them it was " not a brothel here " before turning performers and journalists onto the street .
a hotel spokesman said they had not been told about the nature of the event .
meanwhile competition for the palme d 'or itself - and other related awards - continues to hot up , with director david lynch 's new film mulholland drive to be shown on wednesday .
the new feature from lynch , who won a palme d 'or for wild at heart in 1990 , has been described as a " fragmented dream-like movie that , once unravelled , packs one hell of a wallop " .
lynch is best known for twin peaks , dune and blue velvet .
and cannes film-lovers are currently mourning the death of italian director mauro bolognini , whose work was twice nominated for the palme d 'or in the 1970s .
he died on monday at the age of 78 after a long illness .
l 'eredità ferramonti was in competition at the festival in 1976 , with metello entered in 1970 .

bristol and bath universities are jointly building a " centre of excellence " at the emerson 's green site .
the academic innovation centre aims to take the hottest new research ideas and turn them into money spinners , developing commercial uses for products conceived by academics .

' conduit ' the two universities have formed a company , emerson 's innovations ltd .
its chief executive , peter maxwell , said : " by bringing the two research universities together we can create a research base as big as anywhere in europe .
" when we have a bright idea in the university it will help us communicate that to the commercial world .
" it is a conduit for bringing together the business and academic worlds . "
the science park would be part of a larger 63-acre development of the site , called qwest , which is expected to cost more than £ 160m to build and would include offices and other commercial buildings .
outline planning permission for part of the site has been granted and it is hoped to get the infrastructure in place in the next three months and start building work by the end of the year .

" terrorists opened fire several times on our positions near slupcane and opaje with automatic weapons , machine guns and mortars , " said army spokesman colonel blagoja markovski .

terrorists opened fire on our positions near slupcane and opaje with automatic weapons , machine guns and mortars army colonel blagoja markovski the government deadline gave the rebels until noon on thursday to lay down their arms or leave the country .
a spokesman said the army would not launch any fresh offensives until the deadline had passed , but would respond if provoked .
but after overnight clashes on tuesday , each side accused the other of firing first .
" terrorists opened fire several times on our positions near slupcane and opaje with automatic weapons , machine guns and mortars , " said army spokesman colonel blagoja markovski .
he said troops returned fire , and by daybreak the situation was " tense , but calm " , he said .
fears for civilians rebel commander ali daja told the french news agency afp that the fighting had been fierce , but denied that his men had been the first to open fire .
the villages , in macedonia 's northern hills , have been under rebel control for a fortnight .
thousands of civilians are believed to be trapped , while many more have fled across the border into kosovo .
the government said on tuesday that its ultimatum , setting a thursday deadline for surrender , would give civilians a chance to flee .
the red cross says many people have been left cowering in their cellars in deteriorating conditions and with dwindling food supplies .
red cross officials reached a number of the besieged villages on tuesday and brought 34 villagers to safety .
fresh talks are due in the capital , skopje , later on wednesday between the new government and a delegation from the european union .
swedish foreign minister anna lindh , who is leading the three-strong team , will push officials to undertake further reforms .
the eu fears that , if macedonia slides into civil war , a new round of balkans instability could be unleashed .
the new government - which includes two ethnic albanian parties - is working on ways to build confidence between the country 's different ethnic groups , in an attempt to steer a path back towards peace .
warning macedonia 's new defence minister , vlado buckovski , warned on tuesday that instant peace was unlikely .
" we must not bear any illusions that such attacks will halt overnight , " mr buckovski said .
" the new government has no magic wand but we will work painstakingly to solve our country 's problems . "

bristol and bath universities are jointly building a " centre of excellence " at the emerson 's green site .
the academic innovation centre aims to take the hottest new research ideas and turn them into money spinners , developing commercial uses for products conceived by academics .
it has taken 11 years for the future of the site to be sealed and it is hoped it will encourage graduates to stay in the area and boost the number of skilled workers .
' conduit ' the two universities have formed a company , emerson 's innovations ltd .
its chief executive , peter maxwell , said : " by bringing the two research universities together we can create a research base as big as anywhere in europe .
" when we have a bright idea in the university it will help us communicate that to the commercial world .
" it is a conduit for bringing together the business and academic worlds . "
the science park would be part of a larger 63-acre development of the site , called qwest , which is expected to cost more than £ 160m to build and would include offices and other commercial buildings .
outline planning permission for part of the site has been granted and it is hoped to get the infrastructure in place in the next three months and start building work by the end of the year .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- scandinavian telcos talk mergers low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 16 may , 2001 , 11:54 gmt 12:54 uk scandinavian telcos talk mergers a telenor-teledanmark deal would put telia on the back foot the former norwegian state telecoms monopoly , telenor , has downplayed prospects for a merger with danish rival teledanmark .
telenor said it has been talking with us carrier sbc communications about acquiring its stake in teledanmark but said the discussions " may or may not continue " .
any merger of the two scandinavian operators would be a severe blow to swedish rival telia .
but analysts gave a telenor-teledanmark tie-up little chance of success , saying talks would probably fall apart over nationalistic considerations as had earlier talks between telenor and telia .
sweden problem kenneth graversen , an analyst at enskilda securities in copenhagen , said additional factors militated against a deal .
" firstly , mega-mergers are not fashionable in the sector and secondly , a combined company will still have problems in sweden where its position will still not be very large . "
other complications included various stakes the operators hold in other scandinavian and european telecoms firms , which would have to be sold at considerable losses for a merger to proceed .
despite dismissing the likelihood of a deal with telenor , analysts did say teledanmark was , in the longer term , likely to merge with another telecoms group .
teledanmark shares up the financial times newspaper on wednesday reported that telenor and teledanmark were in advanced talks about a 18bn euro -lrb- $ 16bn ; £ 11bn -rrb- merger of equals .
rumours about a merger between the two have circulated in the market for some time but wednesday 's report sent teledanmark shares up nearly 7 % in early trade .
telenor shares were flat .
sbc is teledanmark 's largest shareholder , with a 42 % stake .
telenor is 79 % owned by the norwegian state although the government has said it will reduce its stake gradually to 51 % .
