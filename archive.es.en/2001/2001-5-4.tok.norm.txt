the prime minister is expected to spend the weekend preparing for the forthcoming election campaign after he cancelled a foreign trip planned for monday .
downing street said his decision not to attend a conference of european socialist leaders was taken so that he could concentrate on " domestic issues . "
an article by mr blair in the times on friday , in which he pledges to press for reform of international asylum laws , has further fuelled predictions that he is gearing up to call the election . "
tony blair is desperate to distance himself from this left-wing jamboree because he knows it reveals labour 's true intentions towards the european union " francis maude foreign secretary robin cook will now take mr blair 's place at monday 's conference of european socialist leaders in berlin .
shadow foreign secretary francis maude took a dim view of mr blair 's cancellation , saying that the prime minister wanted to avoid the european issue so close to an election campaign .
" tony blair is desperate to distance himself from this left-wing jamboree because he knows it reveals labour 's true intentions towards the european union , " he said .
" labour and the other eu socialist parties want a superstate with a single army , a single government and a single tax system to go with the single currency . "
on thursday mr blair paved the way for the election when he called a press conference in which he declared that britain was now on the " home straight " in the battle against foot-and-mouth disease .
his intervention in the asylum issue is said to be aimed at countering conservative claims that the government is " soft " on asylum .
' no unfair advantage ' meanwhile , civil servants have been told to treat the government 's spin doctors like ordinary members of the public once the election is called .
the head of the civil service , sir richard wilson , said that the ruling applied to all politically-appointed special advisers , including the prime minister 's official spokesman , alastair campbell .
conservative and liberal democrat mps had complained that these advisers would have an unfair advantage when the election was called , because they would be able to switch immediately into election campaigning mode .
once the election is called , mr campbell and other special advisers will be denied access to the government 's information system , known as the knowledge network .
the 7 june date has been touted since the prime minister decided not to go to the polls on 3 may because of the foot-and-mouth crisis .
william hague has admitted to party workers in conservative central office that all the polls suggested the tories would lose the election .
but he argued the polls had been wrong at the last european elections and would prove wrong again .

in an uncompromising message , ivory coast - the world 's biggest producer of cocoa - has blamed the multinationals for keeping prices low and farmers in poverty , driving some of them into using forced labour .
senior ivory coast ministers are pressing their case to the uk government at meetings on friday , and the chocolate companies have been called to the foreign office to explain their policies .
the ivory coast prime minister , pascal affi n 'guessan , said chocolate companies were only interested in their own profits .
britons consume £ 4m of chocolate very year if child labour was to stop , he said , the companies would have to pay considerably more to the farmers who grow cocoa .
the international industry itself was at the heart of the problem of child trafficking in africa , he said , adding that multinationals had encouraged more and more developing countries to grow cocoa , which had forced down the price .
he named a price almost 10 times higher than it is now to ensure the quality of life for the seven million farmers and their families in ivory coast .
two ivory coast cabinet ministers have flown to london for a meeting with the foreign office minister for africa , brian wilson .
after that , mr wilson will be seeing chocolate executives to try to persuade them to do more to ensure their products are not tainted by slave labour .
the industry says the buying chain for cocoa is so complex that it is impossible to guarantee the working practices on every farm .

the marine conservation society said it has surveyed hundreds of beaches across the uk , but in scotland only 20 of the 111 examined have been recommended .
the same survey in 2000 suggested strides had been made north of the border , with the number of recommended beaches going up from eight in 1999 , to 19 .
the mcs 's good beach guide this year recommends 275 beaches in the uk which have met the highest european water quality standard .
the charity 's 14th guide also lists 90 beaches which have failed to meet the european union 's water quality standard .
billed as the ultimate independent guide to water quality and sewage discharges , only beaches which the mcs considers free from bacterial contamination have won approval .
to achieve this they must pass the eu 's water quality standard which demands that 100 % of samples are contamination-free .
the highest concentration of recommended beaches was found in the south west of the uk - including the surf beaches round devon and cornwall - where 113 out of 201 passed .
water treatment in the south east of england , 49 out of the 139 beaches sampled were recommended .
four of scotland 's best beaches were in the fife region , including roome bay in crail , a pretty village 10 miles south east of st andrews .
the dramatic coastline of angus also scored points for its attractive beach at the commercial port of montrose and for nearby lunan bay .
kate hutchinson , an mcs coastal pollution officer , said scotland is lagging behind because of the way waste water is treated .
however , she said that overall , the mcs believes the tests carried out by the environment agency and its sister organisations in scotland , northern ireland and the channel islands show an encouraging improvement in bathing water quality .

mr jones was addressing some of scotland 's most senior business leaders on thursday evening and criticised what he called " damaging myths " about plant closures .
digby jones was addressing scottish business leaders he said it was naive to believe that one-off redundancy costs were the main reason for closing one factory over another .
speaking in the wake of motorola 's decision to shut its bathgate plant , with the loss of 3,000 jobs , mr jones said firms would consider a bigger picture when considering closure .
" firms have many other long-term issues to consider , like skilled labour , productivity , taxes , proximity to market , transport , communication , exchange rates and capacity , " he said " nobody likes to see factories close down and people losing jobs - no employee , no trade unionist , no politician and certainly no employer .
" but it will not help anyone if we allow damaging myths to become accepted facts . "
he said uk redundancy rules were challenging and offered meaningful consultation , " contrary to perception " .
" in reality , firms must discuss timing and implementation of redundancies plus the decisions behind them .
" failure to consult leads to stiff penalties .
' meaningful consultation ' " of course , companies take making people redundant extremely seriously so consultation rarely reveals startling new facts .
" but the possibility of changing the original decision does exist and that means meaningful consultation can and does take place . "
the cbi is participating in a government review of uk redundancy law , alongside the trades union congress .
trade unionists want the government to sign up to a european directive which would require large firms to consult staff about job cuts through a german style works council .
mr jones said such a move would only add another raft of red tape and should be rejected .

the official china daily newspaper warned that developing the missile shield would " break the present fragile global security equilibrium " . "
the united states , already the world 's only superpower , is attempting to seek even greater global hegemony " china daily the condemnation comes amid ongoing friction between both sides as a team of american technicians attempts to inspect the us spy plane held on hainan island for more than a month .
relations between the two countries have been fraught since the mid-air collision between the plane and a chinese fighter jet on 1 april .
the pentagon now says china is not providing electrical power for the inspection needed to determine if the plane is in a condition to be flown out of china .
spokesman rear admiral craig quigley said the us technical requirements had been worked out with the chinese foreign ministry , but apparently were not passed on to officials at lingshui air base , where the plane is being held .
" as has been our experience recently , it is not at all clear that there 's a good communication flow between one part of the chinese government to another , " said admiral quigley .
but the pentagon has also experienced communication problems of its own which have threatened to further complicate sino-american relations .
in a surprise announcement on wednesday , the us defense department said all military ties with china had been suspended , only to retract the statement two hours later .
the pentagon said the misunderstanding was the result of an aide 's misinterpretation of defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's intentions .
mr bush himself attempted to clarify what was widely seen as an embarrassing blunder .
" what the chinese must understand is we will be firm in our philosophy , consistent in our beliefs , and we want to work to have a relationship that is a positive relationship for both countries , " he said .
on a different front , both china and the us are boosting internet security after an escalation of hacker attacks from the two countries disrupting each other 's systems .
several official chinese websites have been defaced with pornographic material , while in the us , the department of labor was among those hit .
in what is being seen as a more positive development , china 's us ambassador struck a conciliatory note in a speech on thursday , reflecting on " rollercoaster " relations with washington , but dropping the terse rhetoric of recent sino-us clashes .
speaking at the washington asia society 's annual dinner , yang jiechi said establishing a workable relationship , particularly on trade issues , was in both countries interests .

by bbc news online 's emma clark when anyone starts to talk about pensions , most people just glaze over .
this habitual lack of interest probably explains why most workers are unaware that their company pension scheme could short-change them during retirement .
the church of england has just warned that its employees may not have enough to live on in retirement .
the problem is not unique to members of the clergy and the pension industry 's major players are wracking their brains to find a solution .
gillian cook , an associate at one of the industry 's top consultancies , bacon & woodrow , says there is a " very big risk " that many people of today 's generation wo n't have enough to retire on .
ironically , the problem affects a new generation of employees who have deliberately joined company pension schemes to supplement a paltry state allowance .
does anyone have £ 12m ?
this week the church of england announced that it would need to find another £ 12m each year to plug up its pension fund .
the church is concerned that under its current arrangements the clergy wo n't have enough money for a decent retirement .
but the reality is that most employers nowadays would not step in to help .
this is because today 's workers usually sign onto company pension programmes called " defined contribution " schemes .
defined contribution schemes , which came over from the us , allow employers to define at the outset how much they contribute to the employee 's pot of pension money .
such schemes mean employers no longer have to commit to paying a certain amount when employees retire .
therefore , the actual pension received in retirement merely depends on how well the scheme 's investments have performed on the stock market .
this means that the employee bears the risk of whether he or she will have enough retirement money at the end of the day .
in the old days ...
the reason few people have come across this problem before is because it would not have affected their parents or their grandparents .
back in the old days , companies provided pension schemes that paid retired employees a percentage of their working income .
in other words , companies were obliged to pay a certain pension , regardless of how the stock market performed .
these type of schemes - called " final salary " or " defined benefit " schemes still exist , but many are now closed to new employees .
the church of england is rare because it decided two years ago to opt for a final salary scheme , rather than defined contribution , to provide benefits for the clergy .
it is this decision that has left it with an annual bill of £ 12m .
fulfilling promises roger radford , secretary of the pensions board at the church of england , admits the problem of finding the money would be " less urgent " if the scheme was in fact defined contribution .
with a defined contribution scheme , one does n't need to find money to fulfil certain promises roger radford church of england " with a defined contribution scheme , one does n't need to find money to fulfil certain promises , " he says .
but the church opted for a final salary scheme because it feels a responsibility to provide a specific pension package , he adds .
" further along the line we may look at defined contribution schemes ... a lot of people are saying this is where we ought to go . "
the church 's decision in 1998 to go the final salary route is unusual because it was taken in the midst of mini-pension revolution .
the switch in the late 1990s , many companies were advised to switch to defined contribution schemes to reduce the expense - and risk - of paying set-amount pensions .
the expense and risk for employers have increased as people began to live longer .
currently about £ 850bn in the uk is invested in pension plans .
at the moment , defined contribution schemes make up only a tiny proportion of that .
but the trend toward defined contribution schemes is growing very rapidly , says bacon & woodrow 's ms cook .
she is very concerned that with the new type of scheme many employees will discover a " massive shortfall " between the pension they expect and the money they receive in retirement .
" i do n't think people appreciate what they have to pay in to get a decent pension , " she adds .
the recommended level to pay in is 10-15 % of the monthly pay package , but most people pay 8-9 % .
crunch time the industry has only recently become aware of the problem with the current downturn in the stock markets .
most defined contribution schemes were set up when the markets were doing consistently well , masking the potential problems ahead .
ms cook says the crunch time will come in 10 or 20 years time when today 's employees start to reach pensionable age and find that their pension is inadequate .
the worst will come for employees that need to retire during a stock market downturn - such as there is now .
at retirement , members of a defined contribution scheme cash in their pension investments and use the money to buy an annuity - which is in effect a regular income .
pension providers are able to offer annuities by reinvesting the pension money in bond instruments , which do not make as much money as stocks , but are a lot safer .
however , when shares are down , bonds become more expensive , thereby pushing up the cost of an annuity .
this leaves employees having to buy expensive annuities with pension money that has already taken hit from poor returns in the stock market .
" you certainly do n't want -lrb- market -rrb- volatility one year or six months before you retire , " says robert guy at marketplace , the ifa arm of bradford & bingley .
education there are ways of avoiding this if you can plan exactly when you want to retire .
for example , pension money can be gradually shifted into bonds out of volatile equities several years before retirement .
" if you have that degree of flexibility , you do n't need to worry , " adds mr guy .
but if an employee is sick or made redundant during a market downturn , he or she could lose a substantial amount of money .
if they get to that age , and the planning is done , there is not a lot that can be done robert guy bradford & bingley " if they get to that age , and the planning is done , there is not a lot that can be done , " says mr guy .
bacon & woodrow 's ms cook believes that " there needs to be a massive education programme " to enlighten people about the risks of the new pension schemes .
" it 's a real issue for lots of people today , " she says .
mr guy agrees .
" there is a misconception in people 's mind about how much they need to put away . "
without knowledge and financial discipline , many employees could be heading for a miserable retirement .
the church of england is hoping its parishioners will help foot its annual pension bill of £ 12m .
in 20 year 's time , the impoverished parishioners could looking for a bit of financial support in return .

researchers in leeds found that boys were also suffering obesity problems , with 27 % of 11-year-olds overweight and one in five obese .
the number of youngsters considered fat or obese has almost doubled in the last decade .
rising rates of obesity and weight problems among children is now a major health issue as more than a million children under 16 in the uk are now classified as obese .

" primary schools are a good place to start because the problems tend to start at that age and children at that age are more malleable to lifestyle changes . "
the study , published in the british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- showed that one in five nine-year-old boys and girls was overweight and one in 10 obese .
a quarter of all 10-year-olds were overweight while as early as the age of seven , 14 % of girls and 10 % of boys were considered unhealthily fat .

the 80-year-old pontiff 's brief visit to athens comes as part of a millennial pilgrimage retracing the path of the apostle paul from syria to malta .
even saint cosmas said the pope should be damned because he will be the cause of all evil father maximus the pope 's arrival is expected to be greeted by protests from anarchists and hardliners from the greek orthodox church , the country 's official religion .
hundreds of religious protesters who gathered in central athens last week under banners declaring " out with the two-horned pope " and orthodox monks held an all-night vigil on mount olympus to pray that the pontiff would not come .
the union of greek clerics is planning a mass bell-ringing protest during the pope 's 24-hour stay .
the church leadership , meanwhile , has come under fire from clerics , monks and its more conservative membership for bowing - albeit grudgingly - to government pressure to welcome the pope .
" you have demolished the holy canon , you have insulted the saints who fought the pope , and opened the door for heavy wolves to enter the church , " declares an open letter from the protestors .
surprise invitation the greek president costis stephanopoulos 's invitation to the pope appeared to take both the greek media and the government by surprise .
papal " offences " against orthodoxy 1054 " great schism " dividing christianity 1204 the sacking of constantinople during the fourth crusade the inquisition the vatican 's recognition of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia the vatican immediately made it public and the greek foreign minister george papandreou was forced to issue a statement stressing that the pontiff would be coming in his capacity as head of state - an apparent attempt to head off a row with the greek orthodox church .
the greek church 's outspoken leader , archbishop christodoulos , was later persuaded to agree to the visit .
archbishop christodoulos 's decision breaks a thousand-year-old tradition of hostility which has existed since the " great schism " of 1054 split christianity into eastern and western branches .
they have not forgiven the pope for a long list of " offences " - from the great schism itself right up to the vatican 's recognition of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
anti-pope prophesy some of the protestors believe that the greek orthodox saint cosmas sent them a prophetic warning about the pope .
when the orthodox speak of the fourth crusade , you 'd think it was an event of world war ii roman catholic archbishop in greece " we were informed about his years ago by saint cosmas , " an old woman in black headscarf said .
" he warned that total catastrophe will come from the pope himself .
he is as much of a heretic as it is possible to be . "
father maximus , who organised some of the protests agreed : " although one should never condemn a person , even saint cosmas said the pope should be damned because he will be cause of all evil . "
around 50,000 of greece 's 10 million population are thought to be roman catholic , with another 200,000 among greece 's foreign residents .
many will attend a speech to be given by the pope in a large stadium in an athens suburb on saturday .
last spring , pope john paul ii apologised for any offences committed by catholic faithful , and the roman catholic archbishop in greece , nicholas of athens , told a local newspaper that the pope might use the trip to try to heal the historic breach with the orthodox church .
" many of us - including me - are expecting something will happen .
pope john paul ii has accustomed people to such breaks -lsb- with the past -rsb- .
i do n't know the specifics right now , but i would not rule out some kind of a surprise , " the archbishop said .
but he said this would not immediately wipe out the many historical grievances voiced by the orthodox faithful .
" this historical past burdens greece and can not be erased from one day to the other .
when the orthodox speak of the fourth crusade , you 'd think it was an event of world war ii . "

the bank has agreed its merger deal with halifax , its latest attempt to tie the knot with another bank .
fears had existed that the deal could be gatecrashed as australia 's nab and the prudential were both tipped to have an eye on the scottish bank .
shareholders could still veto the deal , but the two banks look set to create a " fifth force " in the uk banking sector , long dominated by four top banks , and result in making the market more competitive .
the £ 28bn merger places the new banking group at the bottom of a uk league which includes royal bank of scotland , now owner of natwest , lloyds tsb , barclays and hsbc .
unlike previous uk mergers , such as that between royal bank of scotland and natwest , there is little overlap between the two banks - either geographically or in business terms .
a good deal ?
even without substantial cost savings , the deal is seen as a good move for the two banks concerned .
halifax is the uk 's largest mortgage provider and with over 20 million customers and balances of over £ 80bn in savings , it is in a good position to provide bank of scotland with ready funding for corporate lending .
so , bank of scotland will gain access to a cheaper funding base as well as a substantially increased customer base .
halifax will benefit from bank of scotland 's experience in credit cards as well its corporate and small business expertise .
some cost savings and revenue synergies are expected , in it and at the head office , while one analyst suggests that this could be as much as £ 500m .
no longer solo early last year , the scottish bank made it clear that while a solo future might be viable , it is no longer desirable .
since it lost out in the bid for a hostile takeover of national westminister bank last year , it has put on its best frock and been looking for a suitor .
for a while , this seemed to be abbey national .
but earlier this year , the abbey terminated merger talks with bank of scotland , over complications presented by the counter bid from lloyds tsb for the former building society .
competition now the lloyds tsb / abbey deal is facing regulator scrutiny .
ironically , a merger between halifax and bank of scotland could ease the regulatory path for abbey and lloyds tsb .
teather & greenwood banking analyst sarah horder , says the creation of a fifth force might soften the regulator 's stance on a lloyds tsb / abbey national takeover .
regulatory concerns on this deal , however , are thought to be few .
the fact that the oft cleared the chance of a bank of scotland / abbey national merger earlier this year makes it more likely that bank of scotland / halifax deal will be cleared .
banking competition the banking and insurance sectors have been subject to increased competition and this , as well as falling share prices , have led to increased merger activity in the sector .
chief executives are feeling pressure from shareholders and boards to focus on mergers and acquisitions in an effort to improve returns .
barclays has taken over woolwich , natwest was the subject of a hostile takeover battle , while abbey national took over scottish provident , a mutual insurance company , and lloyds tsb bought scottish widows .
online newcomers such as internet banks egg and smile -lrb- run by the prudential and the coop bank respectively -rrb- have offered cheaper rates which threaten to cut existing margins .
the merger wave is n't just concentrated in the uk , it is also evident across europe .
french banks led the way when banque national de paris took over banque paribas .
the german banking sector is also rife with rumours as well as attempts at consolidation , with giant insurer allianz buying dresdner .
