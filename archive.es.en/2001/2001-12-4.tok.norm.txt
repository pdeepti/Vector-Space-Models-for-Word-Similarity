culture secretary tessa jowell , who heads the government 's ministerial committee on the jubilee , is to announce on tuesday that officers and special constables with more than five years ' service will receive the medals to celebrate the queen 's 50 years on the throne .

a ground-launched interceptor missile hit a dummy warhead fired over the south pacific on tuesday morning , the third successful hit in five attempts .
the test was originally scheduled for last saturday but was postponed twice because of bad weather .
the tests have been criticised for their cost - the bill for each is $ 100m - and for being unrealistic .
president george w bush and the us military argue the tests are needed so america can develop a protective shield against missiles launched by rogue states .
but russia and china oppose the plan , saying it would breach existing arms control agreements .
a pentagon spokeswoman said these tests were just a beginning .
" it 's just one in a long line of tests we intend to conduct to test a layered missile defence system , " cheryl irwin told the afp news agency .
dummy warhead the test involved two rockets .
one , launched from california , carried a dummy warhead and a decoy balloon .
a ground-based radar , spotting the objects , guided a second missile , the interceptor , towards the warhead .
the interceptor , launched from kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands , closed on the dummy at 26,000 km / h -lrb- 15,000 mph -rrb- .
as these are tests and safety is an important factor , the pentagon 's rules state that the sky must be clear enough to track the missile visually .
bad weather meant this has not been the case in recent days .
in wartime , weather would not be a consideration .
however , some scientists have raised doubts about the performance of the radar system in bad weather .
rain and fog water in the atmosphere absorbs electromagnetic waves , including those which the so-called x-band radar uses to track missiles .
the frequencies of the x-band system are less affected by water than some others .
but it is unclear what effect rain and fog would have on the ability of the radar to discriminate between a target and a decoy .
the union of concerned scientists , which recently released a report on the missile defence system , says that several aspects of the tests suggest they have been designed to maximise the chances of success .

musicnet , which is backed by warner , emi and bertelsmann , is available through realnetworks ' new realone service from tuesday .
the launch comes one day after listen.com 's subscription-based rhapsody service went online , while peter gabriel 's webaudionet is due to start later this month .
the remaining two major record labels , sony and vivendi universal , will launch their version , pressplay , early next year .
convince fans by then , music fans will have a wide choice of legitimate download sites through which to access almost any music they want .
but analysts are still unsure whether they will convince fans to abandon free song-swapping services in the napster mould .
musicnet subscribers will pay $ 9.95 -lrb- Â£ 7 -rrb- per month to get 100 downloads per month from a choice of 75,000 tracks .
madonna , the beatles and whitney houston are among the artists who are on musicnet 's major label record companies .
subscribers will also get access to 100 webcast sources .
but no site will provide a comprehensive catalogue , regardless of record label , as napster and other sites have done .
if they ca n't find a song on a site , they wo n't be coming back again susan kervorkian idc analyst jupiter research 's mark mulligan doubts the musicnet offering is enough to woo consumers yet .
" they need to offer a greater choice of catalogue , if someone subscribes to musicnet ... they will only have access to a limited amount of content , " he told the bbc 's world business report .
crucially , consumers need to forget the " napster phenomenon " and get used to the whole idea of paying for music online , he said .
" online music users do n't know whether they 're listening to a sony-published song or a bertelsmann-backed artist , " said susan kervorkian , an analyst with technology consultancy idc .
" if they ca n't find a song on a site , they wo n't be coming back again . "
idc has predicted that the online music market is expected to top $ 1.6bn -lrb- Â£ 1.1bn -rrb- by 2005 .
another potential factor that may put users off is the fact that some services limit the way that songs can be copied on to portable mp3 players .
for example , rhapsody 's copy-protection system means a part of the music file remains on listen.com 's computers , meaning the user can only listen to the song on their computer .
legal action free download services have continued to be popular - despite the fact that they are unauthorised and do not pay any royalties to artists , record labels and publishing companies .
napster , one such site , started the online music boom and had 60 million users at its peak .
but it was forced to close after being sued by the american music industry .
other sites have moved in to fill the gap - but they are slowly being targeted for legal action by record companies which have finally seen the potential of online distribution .

musicnet , which is backed by warner , emi and bertelsmann , is available through realnetworks ' new realone service from tuesday .
the launch comes one day after listen.com 's subscription-based rhapsody service went online , while peter gabriel 's webaudionet is due to start later this month .
the remaining two major record labels , sony and vivendi universal , will launch their version , pressplay , early next year .
convince fans by then , music fans will have a wide choice of legitimate download sites through which to access almost any music they want .
but analysts are still unsure whether they will convince fans to abandon free song-swapping services in the napster mould .
musicnet : one of the first paid-for download services musicnet subscribers will pay $ 9.95 -lrb- Â£ 7 -rrb- per month to get 100 downloads per month from a choice of 75,000 tracks .
madonna , the beatles and whitney houston are among the artists who are on musicnet 's major label record companies .
subscribers will also get access to 100 webcast sources .
but no site will provide a comprehensive catalogue , regardless of record label , as napster and other sites have done .
if they ca n't find a song on a site , they wo n't be coming back again susan kervorkian idc analyst jupiter research 's mark mulligan doubts the musicnet offering is enough to woo consumers yet .
" they need to offer a greater choice of catalogue , if someone subscribes to musicnet ... they will only have access to a limited amount of content , " he told the bbc 's world business report .
crucially , consumers need to forget the " napster phenomenon " and get used to the whole idea of paying for music online , he said .

hynix shares closed 8 % higher at 2,660 won. a five year high , after it announced that a team from micron would arrive in korea on tuesday to begin two weeks of meetings .
" both companies are evaluating a broad array of strategic options to maximize stakeholder value in the face of an unprecedented downturn in the semiconductor industry , " said hynix chief executive park chong-sup and steve appleton , chief executive of micron .
but mr park said that one option was for micron to take a controlling stake in hynix , possibly through an equity swap with creditors .
if a merger was to go ahead , the new company would overtake samsung electronics as the largest maker of memory chips , with 37 % of the world market .
the news could also trigger other mergers in the industry , with infineon and toshiba also discussing a tie-up .
" micron is probably following the path we are going , as major industry players drive consolidation , " said ulrich schumacher of infineon .
both hynix and micron have suffered from a sharp fall-off in demand for personal computers , which has hit sales of their main product , memory chips .
losses hynix posted its largest ever loss - $ 1.24bn - in the three months to september and is estimated to owe 8.64 trillion won -lrb- $ 6.8bn -rrb- .
in late october , it gained some breathing space , after its main creditors signed up to a multi-billion dollar rescue package .
the price of d-ram memory chips has collapsed from $ 17 to $ 1 as computer manufacturers have cut production .
in the past , micron has strongly criticised the rescue plan and argued that it broke world trade rules .
but now analysts believe that a merger would lead to significant cuts in capacity , possibly closing old hynix plants and reducing the glut on the market .
" the rationalisation of capacity that may result from a hynix deal is good news for micron , " said joseph osha of merrill lynch .
output cut hynix 's mr park also took the opportunity to call for a cut in output by major chip producers in order to boost the market .
this has been unpopular in the past because chip makers have been reluctant to risk losing market share .
hynix and micron will decide in a month whether their " exploratory " talks have come to anything , company officials said .
but whatever the outcome , the merger wave in the semi-conductor industry is likely to continue .

last year the number of people who died in drink-drive accidents totalled 520 - a rise on the previous year of 60 deaths .
20,000 families have been saved from enduring an empty chair at the christmas table transport minister david jamieson the campaign comes after criticism was levelled against the government for not paying enough attention to the problem of drug driving .
instead the government will focus on the success of its anti-drink drive initiatives as it launches its christmas campaign on tuesday .
click here to see estimated annual drink-drive fatalities it estimates that in 25 years of campaigning 20,000 lives have been saved and hundreds of thousands of injuries have been prevented .
the latest campaign will include graphic television advertisements showing the aftermath of real-life accidents set to familiar christmas songs such as jingle bells .
launched in london by transport minister david jamieson , the campaign comes at a time of concern both about the level of drink drive-related fatalities and the effects of drugs on drivers .
he said : " 20,000 families have been saved from enduring an empty chair at the christmas table .
deaths rise " but we can never be satisfied until every driver is instilled with the message that drinking and driving do not mix . "
a department of transport spokesman emphasised the success of previous anti-drink drive campaigns .
" the number of fatalities in drink-drive accidents was as high as 1,640 in the late 1970s and has come down considerably since then .
" we are hoping that the rise in deaths last year was a temporary blip .
breathalysers ' insufficient ' " as far as drugs and driving is concerned , we recognise this is a complicated issue . "
the transport research laboratory in berkshire said on monday that nearly one in five victims of fatal car accidents in england and wales had drugs in their bloodstream .
the figures showed a fivefold increase in the past 10 years .
breathalysers only measure alcohol and so can not identify drivers who are under the influence of drugs .

last year the number of people who died in drink-drive accidents totalled 520 - a rise on the previous year of 60 deaths .
20,000 families have been saved from enduring an empty chair at the christmas table transport minister david jamieson the campaign comes after criticism was levelled against the government for not paying enough attention to the problem of drug driving .
instead the government will focus on the success of its anti-drink drive initiatives as it launches its christmas campaign on tuesday .
click here to see estimated annual drink-drive fatalities it estimates that in 25 years of campaigning 20,000 lives have been saved and hundreds of thousands of injuries have been prevented .
the latest campaign will include graphic television advertisements showing the aftermath of real-life accidents set to familiar christmas songs such as jingle bells .
launched in london by transport minister david jamieson , the campaign comes at a time of concern both about the level of drink drive-related fatalities and the effects of drugs on drivers .
he said : " 20,000 families have been saved from enduring an empty chair at the christmas table .
deaths rise " but we can never be satisfied until every driver is instilled with the message that drinking and driving do not mix . "
a department of transport spokesman emphasised the success of previous anti-drink drive campaigns .
" the number of fatalities in drink-drive accidents was as high as 1,640 in the late 1970s and has come down considerably since then .
" we are hoping that the rise in deaths last year was a temporary blip .
breathalysers ' insufficient ' " as far as drugs and driving is concerned , we recognise this is a complicated issue . "
the transport research laboratory in berkshire said on monday that nearly one in five victims of fatal car accidents in england and wales had drugs in their bloodstream .
the figures showed a fivefold increase in the past 10 years .
breathalysers only measure alcohol and so can not identify drivers who are under the influence of drugs .

sometimes it is vaguely sweet , like autumnal garden fires .
but most of the time it is an acrid stench of burning plastic , wafting over the tourists as they approach " ground zero " , where the twin towers of the world trade center collapsed .
there is a perimeter fence all around the disaster site - tall and shrouded metal fencing , set up behind wooden " police line - do not cross " barriers .
but as the smell fades , the spectators are getting closer .
not long ago , the fence kept the public several blocks away .
now this ultimate frontier in disaster tourism is just a few hundred metres from ground zero .
and wherever the grid of manhattan streets affords a clear view of the world trade center ruins , throngs of tourists crowd around the barriers .
all that remains to get a better view , people clamber on lamp posts , garbage bins and bollards .
even up there , they do not see much .
under the glare of huge arc lights , tips of cranes and diggers can be seen moving around .
were it not for the stench , and for the memory of the silvery towers soaring skyward until a few months ago , it could be any well-protected construction site .
but as the tourists wander along the fence , the illusion soon disappears .
easily outnumbering the people in uniform are the street hawkers , selling patriotic trinkets and world trade center memorabilia approaching from the north , along greenwich street , the sightseers are suddenly confronted with the hulking , burnt-out remains of world trade center 7 - one of the smaller towers , brought down by a fierce blaze well after the two main towers collapsed .
still 10 or 12 storeys high , the blackened outlines of what once were offices can be made out in the structure .
most visitors seem to believe that they are looking at one of the twin towers , but are soon corrected .
patient new yorkers , taking their visiting friends and family to the site , explain what is where and point to what remains of the twin towers - one tall silvery skeleton of metal , once part of the honeycomb structure of their walls .
but much of the debris from the towers has gone , put on trucks and shipped to a dump on staten island .
no place for laughter a walk around the perimeter fence can be surreal .
at times it feels like a tourist fair .
a few metres on , it has the character of a pilgrimage .
and not much further , the trappings of a political demonstration .
wherever the disaster site is visible , mourners have attached flowers , cards and posters to the fencing .
there are teddy bears with notes to lost loved-ones .
messages of comfort , solidarity and defiance .
and us flags , hundreds of flags .
" infidels are welcome here , " shouts one poster .

and there are numerous leaflets - all similar , but not identical - showing a picture , a name , and the words " missing since september 11 " .
some tourists gawk and jostle for the best position to take a picture , ignoring the signs asking them not to use video cameras and not to take pictures of the rescue workers .
but faced with the reminders of death , most tourists are quiet , and unusually polite .
there is no laughter here .
many people pray and contemplate .
occasionally a few dust-covered rescue workers emerge from behind the fences , respirator masks dangling from their necks .

bbc correspondents say the ruling opens the way for further military reprisals against palestinian leader yasser arafat , whom israel blames for not stopping palestinian suicide attacks that killed at least 25 people over the weekend .
but the declaration has caused a rift in mr sharon 's unity cabinet - foreign minister shimon peres accused the government of attempting to bring about the downfall of the palestinian authority , and said his labour party would consider seriously whether to stay in the coalition .
on tuesday morning , israeli helicopters fired missiles near yasser arafat 's headquarters in the west bank town of ramallah .
there are reports that the building was hit , but it is not known whether mr arafat was there at the time .
the strike against ramallah came after israeli troops and bulldozers moved into gaza airport on monday night and began ripping up its runway as part of a wave of retaliation .
israeli forces have now withdrawn from the airport .
israeli soldiers were also reported to have entered several palestinian-ruled areas in the west bank , including the town of ramallah , where they were poised just 200 metres from mr arafat 's compound there .
arafat is the biggest obstacle to peace and to stability in the middle east ariel sharon and in the west bank town of nablus , a member of fatah was reportedly shot dead by israeli gunfire .
the latest developments follow monday 's assault by israeli helicopter gunships on mr arafat 's symbols of power , including two of his helicopters in gaza city .
israeli f-16 warplanes were also in action on monday , attacking buildings in the west bank town of jenin .
palestinian information minister yasser abed rabbo denied the charges of terrorism , saying that israel 's occupation of the west bank and gaza strip was " the source of terrorism " , and that israel 's actions were making the prospects of peace more remote .
palestinian leader yasser arafat has called for an emergency summit of muslim leaders , as arab states accused mr sharon of trying to kill off any hope of reviving a peace process in the middle east .
tough measures the israeli cabinet met after mr sharon gave a televised address in which he held mr arafat responsible for " everything happening here " .
sharon said israel would use all available means to defend itself " he has made the strategic decision to follow terrorism .
he has tried to make political gains through the death of innocents , " he said .
mr sharon said israel would " chase those responsible for terrorism ... those who carry it out will pay the price " .
he said israel would launch a war on terror similar to the one begun by the us after it was attacked in september .
" just as the united states acts in its battle against world terror , so shall we do with all the means at our disposal , " he said .
the tanzim militia , which is associated with mr arafat 's fatah party , and the elite force-17 , which handles his personal security , were among those declared terror organisations by israel .
after an 18-1 vote in favour of tougher security measures , israel 's national unity cabinet issued a statement saying " a wider scope of activity against palestinian terrorism " was required .
but labour party ministers reportedly walked out of the meeting before the vote - they are now considering whether to stay in the coalition government .
correspondents say mr sharon can continue in government without labour backing .

dozens of israelis died in attacks at the weekend he called on the us " to interfere and stop sharon before it 's too late " .
but white house spokesman ari fleischer has made it clear that the us will not try to rein israel in .
" israel is a sovereign power , " mr fleischer said on monday .
" israel has a right to defend itself . "
following the weekend 's suicide bomber attacks on jerusalem and haifa , the israeli army tightened its blockade around palestinian towns and villages in the west bank , while the palestinian authority declared a state of emergency in the west bank and gaza .
palestinian security forces are reported to have arrested more than 100 militants on the west bank and gaza amid intense international pressure on mr arafat to take decisive action against radical palestinian groups .
most of those arrested belonged to hamas , which said it carried out the weekend attacks , palestinian security sources said . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's caroline thomsett " israel 's message is clear - this is a war on terror " ron prosor , israeli embassy political minister says israel is at war with the palestinian authority saeb erekat , senior palestinian negotiator " the international aiport is destroyed " the bbc 's james reynolds in jerusalem " the israelis see mr arafat as part of the problem " key stories palestinian disarray backing the bombers us demands distant hope arafat 's successors ?

plans to ensure net firms in the uk help with anti-terrorism investigations are flawed and need clarifying , it is claimed .
the more heavy-handed legislation we have , the less attractive the uk becomes for international e-commerce uk 's internet service providers association the industry body representing british internet service providers claims swiftly drafted anti-terror legislation could impose a heavy burden on firms .
the new laws do little to compensate net companies for the work they will have to undertake to comply with the crackdown , claims the body .
the proposed legislation also does little to give legal protection to firms helping legitimate police enquiries , it says .
net protests the controversial anti-terrorism , crime and security bill goes before the house of lords on tuesday for debate and possible amendment .
the measures included in the bill are intended to help police forces investigate suspected terrorists , as well as make it much more difficult for terror groups to fund themselves or to hide their activities .
the house of lords debates the anti-terrorism legislation on tuesday however , the bill has been widely criticised by civil liberty campaigners , who claim it tramples over widely held freedoms in the name of tactics that will be of little use when tackling terror .
peers are expected to savage the draft bill , but even before they get the chance to have their say , the uk 's internet service providers association has weighed in with its own criticisms .
a spokeswoman for ispa said the proposed bill needed much more refinement before it became workable .
" we are concerned that these plans are going through the house very quickly with very little parliamentary scrutiny , " she said .
equipment costs the net industry body has particular problems with clauses in the bill that call on them to retain records of the surfing habits and e-mail correspondence of their customers , she said .
the details of just what information net service firms were expected to keep and how long they should retain it had not been spelled out in sufficient detail in the bill , said the spokeswoman .
ispa also has worries about the cost of retaining records on large numbers of customers .
so far , she said , there were few guarantees about the compensation that would be given to firms which would have to buy new equipment to retain the data .
when joined with the equally controversial regulation of investigator powers act , which also forces net providers to help police forces with investigations , the legislation was in danger of hobbling british net firms , she warned .
she called on the government to re-think its plans and tighten up the legislation before it was passed .
" we totally support the broad aims of the bill and the industry works closely with government and law enforcement in assisting wherever we can , " she said , " but the more heavy-handed legislation we have , the less attractive the uk becomes for international e-commerce . "

in its latest report , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , which is made up of the leading industrial countries , paints a gloomy picture of japan 's economic prospects .
there will be no growth without reform heizo takenaka economy minister " although a slowdown was expected , the deceleration has been surprisingly rapid , " the oecd warns .
it is forecasting negative growth for japan of -0.75 % this year and -1 % next year , and says the best japan can expect in 2003 would be an anaemic 0.75 % increase in gdp .
and if " immediate prospects do not look bright , " future " risks are weighted to the downside , " the report adds .
japan 's economic growth 2001 : -0.75 % 2002 : -1 % 2003:0.75 % source : oecd it says the slowdown is " symptomatic of the failure to adequate address structural problems in the past . "
" after a decade of lost opportunities , it is now urgent for japan to move ahead with fundamentally reforming its economic structure , " the oecd adds .
" what is needed now is for the government to rapidly redress these weaknesses , even at the cost of temporary negative growth , " it adds .
after a decade of lost opportunities , it is now urgent for japan to move ahead with fundamentally reforming its economic structure oecd the most urgent problem is the disposal of bad loans which are weighing down the banking sector , and the oecd warns that there are further risks if banks are forced to report heavy capital losses on their stock market holdings due to falls in the nikkei stock index .
japan 's heavy government debt burden - the largest among oecd members - is also criticised , and the report says that japan will have to run a budget surplus of 4 % of gdp just to stabilise the situation .
credit fears but credit agencies fear that japan 's politicians have little appetite for reducing that debt .
moody 's has become the latest rating agency to downgrade japan 's government bonds .
moody 's said there was little hope of a quick turnaround in japan 's fortunes whatever the policies adopted by the government .
" neither current macroeconomic policies nor new reform initiatives offer much tangible hope for an early turnaround in economic performance , " the us-based agency said .
it has downgraded japan 's domestic government bonds , but left international bonds unchanged .
japan government debt amounts to 130 % of gdp , compared to 30 % in the uk , and moody 's said that " fiscal strains were likely to persist owing to the country 's ongoing economic weakness and the elusiveness of effective policy measures . "
foreign investment falling foreign direct investment in japan fell by 18.7 % in the first half of the year , as investors fled from the troubled financial sector .
total investment was $ 12.3bn , but investment in financial sector firms dropped by 40 % , with only investment in the telecoms sector holding up .
meanwhile , the government admitted that japan would officially fall into recession when the latest figures for gdp are released on friday .
a cabinet report said that japan would only grow by around 1 % a year at best until economic reforms are completed .
it 's a recession last month , the japanese government said it is expecting the economy to shrink 0.9 % for the fiscal year ending in march , rather than the initial target of 1.7 % growth .
japan 's economy was caught up in a " negative cycle " that is preventing growth and both consumers and companies are searching for hope for the future , the report said .
the report defended the policies of prime minister junichiro koizumi , who has promised to clean up the bad debts in the banking sector and rein in public spending .
" there will be no growth without reform , " said heizo takenaka , the economy minister .
but it is clear that the cost of reform will be a further prolonged slowdown in the japanese economy , already suffering from a ten-year slump .
