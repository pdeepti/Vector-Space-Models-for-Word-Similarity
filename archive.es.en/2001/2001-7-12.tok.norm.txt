they were speaking after negotiations with the main pro-agreement parties at weston park , staffordshire , were suspended on wednesday evening without a major breakthrough .
the talks will continue on friday in staffordshire and the smaller political parties have been invited .
the decision to send these parties home after the first day 's negotiations on monday had been questioned by sinn fein and the nationalist sdlp .
the political process has been stalled over the issues of ira arms decommissioning , policing and british army demilitarisation .
the nationalist sdlp has said that some progress had been made on the latter issues , but that more " clarity " was needed on the question of arms .
on wednesday evening , tony blair and bertie ahern said they were optimistic about the parties reaching agreement .
mr blair said he hoped all sides would use the next 24 hours to reflect on their positions adding it was a time for leadership . : fast facts primer click above to launch a primer on where all the parties stand on the deadlock he said there were substantial areas of disagreement and difference .
" we are going to work with complete determination and some hope that we can find a way through , " he said .
" the one thing that stood out from all the discussions was that we had the acceptance by all the political parties that there is no alternative to the good friday agreement that it is the best basis for peace and a stable future for the people of northern ireland . "
mr ahern said the arguments were well known but the solutions were not so easy .
" we have worked hard to try to find those and hopefully we can , " he said .
mr blair missed his weekly appearance at prime minister 's questions in the house of commons to chair the talks in an attempt to find progress .
sdlp deputy leader seamus mallon said some progress had been made at the talks , but there was disappointment and anger that an agreement had not been reached .
speaking as the sdlp delegation left the talks , mr mallon said there had been " advances " on the issues of policing and security normalisation , but not enough to satisfy his party .
he also said there was still a lack of clarity on the decommissioning issue .
leaving the talks , sinn fein president gerry adams said no progress had been made , but insisted that there was still hope for the peace process .
he said : " the big thing is that there is hope , even though it is maybe soiled and wounded .
ten years ago there was no hope . "
the uup delegation left the talks earlier to return to northern ireland for thursday 's traditional climax to the protestant marching season .
mr trimble , who left the talks for other commitments less than 90 minutes after they had begun , said : " we have come here to see if it is possible in the course of this morning to make a little progress . "
but he said that the current nature of the negotiations had left his party with a feeling of disappointment .
there had been a poor response from sinn fein and it had not been able to fulfill its promises , he said .
" they are in denial of the situation and the damage they could do to the process . "

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- assembly says ' yes ' to pay rise low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo bbc wales 's rhuanedd richards " some members also stand to gain an extra Â£ 10,000 " real 56k thursday , 12 july , 2001 , 05:55 gmt 06:55 uk assembly says ' yes ' to pay rise members of the assembly will now earn Â£ 38,000 welsh assembly members have voted unanimously to give themselves a Â£ 1,500 pay rise .
a government quango has said the ams have worked harder than expected and deserve more .
unions have been quick to attack the pay hike , claiming one rule for elected representatives and another one for public sector workers .
the rise , which members , which went before the assembly on thursday , will be on top of the Â£ 1,000 extra given to members in april .
alison halford asked for the rise in april the 7 % increase takes the salary for an ordinary am up to Â£ 38,000 , and is similar to the rise that mps won earlier this year .
additional payments are given if a member has a particular responsibility like a cabinet post .
the senior salaries review board has also allowed other allowances to go up .
a total of 18 members also stand to gain from a redefinition of rules on who can get an allowance to buy or rent a house in cardiff .
that will give them an allowance of Â£ 10,000 extra .
previously , only members living outside the old counties of glamorgan and gwent were entitled .
new rules now the house committee has decided that all ams - apart from those in the cardiff and newport seats and the pontypridd , caerphilly and vale of glamorgan constuencies - can claim the extra allowance .
first minister rhodri morgan said : " i wish we did n't have to do it .
" if we could just implement the ssrb recommendation , that would be fine .
but there is no way around having to vote on it . "
the independent review of salaries in february last year recommended a 2.9 % increase in salaries , in line with the rise for westminster mps , who now earn Â£ 48,000 .
the decision will no doubt raise some public concern .
but the news will be welcomed by delyn am alison halford , who was criticised in april when she said assembly members should earn more .
she said ams had taken on more work and taxpayers should not have to pay twice for the same job .
and she claimed there were too few members to get the work done .

across the land a whole community of avid viewers will be sitting on their sofas , dewy-eyed .
richard and judy have finally cast aside their mantle as the undisputed king and queen of this morning , which over the past 13 years has propelled daytime television into another dimension .
cosy , but often controversial the show of celebrity guests , problem-solving and dishing out golden cash prizes will live to fight another day - but the star ingredient was certainly the gilded couple themselves .
richard madeley and judy finnigan are of course married in " real life " , which gave them the edge over all pretenders to their throne .
chemistry early challengers anne and nick on the bbc were trounced in the ratings - a lovely enough couple , but not man and wife .
viewers quickly warmed to the duo , whose personal chemistry sparkled on the screen .
those little gestures , the occasional glance and their little spats were never played down on air .
the show gave tv its first testicular cancer exam and they also let the great british public glimpse at their family life - their four children put in appearances with satisfying regularity , which made them " like us " .
the pair cleverly gathered their on-screen family all around them , with agony aunt denise and dr chris steele solving the nation 's dilemmas with soothing aplomb .
cosy and the golden couple always had their say as well , making them appear warm and human .
richard and judy 's show was not all about cosy coffee-time chats with soap stars and the latest trends in vegetable gardening .
they kept the viewers glued by treading into previously unseen - and often controversial - domains .
morning time television was treated to its first dangling testicle thanks to richard and judy .
while the tabloids screeched , it was a no-nonsense way to address the real life issue of testicular cancer .
richard and judy : personal chemistry other moments which whipped up a storm were the infamous viagra trial , where willing couples were packed off to a hotel to put the passion-perker to the test .
the gay partnership ceremony showed that richard and judy 's world was all-inclusive .
cult the pair 's success won them fans far and wide .
students built the show into a cult , and richard and judy into tv icons .
and richard responded to this trendiness with his impersonation of ali g , while judy 's bra-revealing antics did her no damage .
for this writer , watching as a student , while " resting " and as a media journalist alike , richard and judy 's show has always been a staple - and it is they who plainly made it click .
richard and judy 's departure brings to an end a golden era of daytime viewing .
the show of course must go on , but it seems impossible that their shoes will ever be filled .
they always made sure an ordinary person won thousands for answering a few simple questions .
judy always showed palpable emotion with callers ' gritty dilemmas - and richard always tried his best to offer some advice .

across the land a whole community of avid viewers will be sitting on their sofas , dewy-eyed .
richard and judy have finally cast aside their mantle as the undisputed king and queen of this morning , which over the past 13 years has propelled daytime television into another dimension .
the show of celebrity guests , problem-solving and dishing out golden cash prizes will live to fight another day - but the star ingredient was certainly the gilded couple themselves .
richard madeley and judy finnigan are of course married in " real life " , which gave them the edge over all pretenders to their throne .
chemistry early challengers anne and nick on the bbc were trounced in the ratings - a lovely enough couple , but not man and wife .
viewers quickly warmed to the duo , whose personal chemistry sparkled on the screen .
those little gestures , the occasional glance and their little spats were never played down on air .
and they also let the great british public glimpse at their family life - their four children put in appearances with satisfying regularity , which made them " like us " .
the pair cleverly gathered their on-screen family all around them , with agony aunt denise and dr chris steele solving the nation 's dilemmas with soothing aplomb .
cosy and the golden couple always had their say as well , making them appear warm and human .
richard and judy 's show was not all about cosy coffee-time chats with soap stars and the latest trends in vegetable gardening .
they kept the viewers glued by treading into previously unseen - and often controversial - domains .
morning time television was treated to its first dangling testicle thanks to richard and judy .
while the tabloids screeched , it was a no-nonsense way to address the real life issue of testicular cancer .
other moments which whipped up a storm were the infamous viagra trial , where willing couples were packed off to a hotel to put the passion-perker to the test .
the gay partnership ceremony showed that richard and judy 's world was all-inclusive .
cult the pair 's success won them fans far and wide .
students built the show into a cult , and richard and judy into tv icons .
and richard responded to this trendiness with his impersonation of ali g , while judy 's bra-revealing antics did her no damage .
for this writer , watching as a student , while " resting " and as a media journalist alike , richard and judy 's show has always been a staple - and it is they who plainly made it click .
richard and judy 's departure brings to an end a golden era of daytime viewing .
the show of course must go on , but it seems impossible that their shoes will ever be filled .
they always made sure an ordinary person won thousands for answering a few simple questions .
judy always showed palpable emotion with callers ' gritty dilemmas - and richard always tried his best to offer some advice .
it seemed they cared about real people , and gave the impression that they were almost ordinary themselves .
let 's hope these national treasures do not fade into obscurity as they move on to less certain pastures new .

i am trying to clarify what the order means police spokesman major general didi widayadi the police chief , general suroyo bimantoro , says he will not step down because the president needs approval from parliament , which has publicly backed the general .
the top legislature is due to convene on 1 august and is widely expected to impeach the president over his chaotic 20-month rule .
the order to arrest the general comes days after the president renewed a threat to call a state of emergency unless proceedings against him were dropped .
police crisis " the president has ordered the chief political and security minister and the caretaker police chief to take tough action ... to avoid the spreading of insubordination , " said presidential spokesman adhie massardi .
" the order will take the form of an arrest . "
he added that the president felt that general bimantoro was using his troops to back a " certain political group " .
he did not elaborate .
mr wahid tried to sack the general last month after he said security forces would not enforce the president 's plan to declare a state of emergency as a means of trying to avoid impeachment .
when the general refused to step down mr wahid then announced his appointment as ambassador to malaysia .
that order was also ignored - instead the general announced he was taking leave and is now thought to be in singapore .
a bbc correspondent in jakarta says the feud between president wahid and his renegade police chief has become an apt symbol of the chaos bordering on farce into which indonesia 's government has descended .
bomb blast a police spokesman said it was not clear exactly what president wahid wanted the force to do now .
" i can not say anything .
i am trying to clarify what the order means , " said national police spokesman major general didi widayadi .
president wahid has said he will dissolve parliament if a compromise is not found by 20 july - the first time he has given a deadline .
meanwhile police said an explosion near parliament on wednesday night appeared to be intended to create fear ahead of impeachment hearings .
at least 14 people were injured in the blast beneath a busy toll road overpass .
it was the latest in a series of unexplained explosions and bombings in jakarta .

its latest report on nhs finances shows the number of cases almost doubled between the years 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 .
the independent audit also revealed health authorities and trusts ran up higher debts than the previous year .
at the end of march 2000 , there were 239 fraud cases with a total value of Â£ 14m being investigated , compared to 484 cases worth an estimated Â£ 18m in march 2001 .
i welcome improvements in financial control within the nhs and the initiatives taken to counter fraud sir john bourne , national audit office the discovery of more fraud is being attributed to the formation of the directorate of counter fraud services in 1998 .
it was the first central body to tackle fraud in the nhs , and has set up a network of regional fraud detectors , and recruited a fraud-buster for each trust and health authority .
a " fraud hotline " was also set up so suspected cases could be reported .
last year , Â£ 7m of illegally-gained money was recovered - though estimates suggest fraud costs the nhs Â£ 2bn a year .
the government has pledged to recover Â£ 6m taken in frauds by 2002 , cut prescription charge evasion by 50 % by 2003 and " reduce fraud to a minimum " within 10 years .
the current cases being investigated include 118 involving gps , 24 involving hospital doctors or surgeons , 128 pharmacists , 37 dentists , 35 opticians and 117 nhs employees .
alleged frauds include claims for non-existent patients and glasses for dead customers .
deficits the annual examination of nhs finances by the nao found 59 out of 99 health authorities were in debt in the year 1999-2000 the total debt for health authorities was Â£ 52m .
some health authorities had deficits approaching 10 % of their income .
in the previous year , 48 out of 100 authorities reported they were in debt .
the total deficit that year was Â£ 25m .
and 150 out of 377 hospital trusts reported they were in debt in 1999-2000 .
trusts ' total deficit was Â£ 77m .
seventy-six had " significant financial difficulties " .
in 1998-99 , 98 out of 402 were in debt .
the total debt for trusts was Â£ 36m .
but the nhs predicts health authorities will have a surplus of Â£ 45m , and trusts a much reduced deficit of Â£ 8m in the next financial year .
and health service managers point out the sums of debt involved are a tiny proportion of their total budgets and in most cases are an inevitable consequence of dealing with such large sums of money .
the report also looks at the nhs 's liability for clinical negligence , and finds the value of known and anticipated cases stood at Â£ 3.9bn at the end of march 2000 .
the nhs would not have to pay out that much in one year .
better accounting sir john bourne , head of the nao , launched the report to parliament on thursday .
he welcomed the counter-fraud initiatives , and the fact that in 1999-2000 , there were 22 successful prosecutions and 34 successful disciplinary cases .
the nao also praised the nhs for tightening up its accounting procedures .
sir john said : " i welcome improvements in financial control within the nhs and the initiatives taken to counter fraud .
" the way forward will be to continue to improve corporate and clinical governance and to ensure that accounting for these large sums presents fully and clearly the financial position of health authorities and trusts . "
nigel edwards , director of policy for the nhs confederation , said the report did not reflect the current state of nhs finances .
" it 's history , it does n't reflect what 's happening now , and the amount of money related to nhs expenditure is very small .
" if you 're spending Â£ 45bn , you 're not going to get your spending bang on the nail . "
a spokesman for the directorate of counter fraud services told bbc news online : " the increase does not mean there is more fraud , it means we are detecting more fraud . "
but former nhs trust chairman roy lilley told the bbc : " the fact that fraud has gone up by such a huge amount will come as a huge disappointment .
" clearly , the measures they have put in place to stop fraud just are not working . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- microsoft : revenue better than expected low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo thursday , 12 july , 2001 , 07:58 gmt 08:58 uk microsoft : revenue better than expected microsoft : heading off " break-up " demand microsoft , the us software giant , has said its quarterly revenue will be higher than previously expected .
the announcement , which came late on wednesday , combined with better than expected results from motorola and yahoo to send tech shares higher in world markets .
microsoft shares were up 6 % in electronic trade after the us markets closed .
but the good news for investors was tempered by news that the company would report its first-ever investment loss , of $ 2.6bn.
microsoft said operating profits for the fourth quarter - which ended on 30 june - were in line with expectations , excluding the investment losses .
" core revenue growth for the quarter was strong and reflects consumer enthusiasm for our products and services despite a slowing economy , " said chief financial officer john connors .
cable and telecoms losses microsoft said quarterly revenue would reach $ 6.5bn-6.6bn , up from previous forecasts of $ 6.3bn-6.5bn.
the $ 2.6bn charge came from losses in cable and telecoms investments .
total investment losses were $ 3.9bn but this was offset by gains from interest , dividends and other equity interests .
the company is due to report results on 19 july .
windows revamp also on wednesday , microsoft said it would revamp its next-generation windows operating system to make it easier for rival companies ' products to compete .
the move follows a recent us court of appeals ruling that microsoft agreements with computer manufacturers had broken competition law .
the court stopped short of requiring the company 's break-up but microsoft 's latest move is being seen as an attempt to head off such action .
some analysts say many microsoft products have already achieved such dominance that wednesday 's announcement will have little practical effect .
but the decision should mark an end to the practice of requiring computer manufacturers to display microsoft products such as internet explorer on the desktops of new computers .
