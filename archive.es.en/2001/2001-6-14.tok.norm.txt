the money will be spent over the next three years as local authorities prepare to meet stricter new waste targets .
welsh councils will get the lion 's share of the assembly cash , with £ 34m going towards preparing them for a massive increase in the amount of waste they 'll be expected to recycle .
at present , around 95 % of waste in wales is buried underground in ever-decreasing landfill sites - putting wales at the bottom of the european recycling league .
but officials hope that by 2010 , the 5 % currently recycled or composted will rise to 40 % - more than in england , where the target stands at 30 % .
english shire counties are currently ahead of the game , recycling 10 % of their waste - twice the amount wales manages .
' unambitious ' new welsh targets are due to be announced later this month , when the assembly publishes its draft waste strategy .
assembly environment minister sue essex is of the view that the targets should be challenging but still attainable .
in march , the environment , transport and regions select committee attacked the uk government 's recycling targets as " depressingly unambitious . "
switzerland , germany and the netherlands already recycle half of their waste .
western australia , on the other hand , is aiming for zero rubbish by 2020 , while canberra has gone from no recycling to 59 % in just eight years .

they say that new techniques could make it possible to detect the fatal brain disease much earlier , and may even help develop a cure .
at present , variant cjd can only be reliably diagnosed by examining brain tissue after death or from a surgically removed sample .
one of the major problems in dealing with bse and vcjd is that it is extremely difficult to detect until shortly before symptoms appear , usually several years after infection .
this is a major scientific breakthrough and has potential applications in improving tests for prion diseases silvano fumero serano this is because it is caused by an abnormal protein , called a prion , which exists in tiny quantities until it begins to affect the brain .
but the swiss researchers say their work could make it possible to recognise the disease from a blood sample .
the abnormal prions which cause bse and vcjd spread by " converting " other prions which they come into contact with in a chain reaction .
they are present in the blood and tissues other than the brain in such small amounts as to be undetectable , until now .
' fast-forward mode ' but claudio soto and colleagues at the serono pharmaceutical research institute in geneva say they have managed to accelerate the conversion process in the laboratory .
this offers hope of detecting prion diseases where previously they would be invisible .
silvano fumero , a senior executive at serono , said : " the procedure mimics the replication of abnormal prion proteins in the body in ' fast-forward ' mode , compressing years of real-life time into a few hours in the laboratory .
" this is a major scientific breakthrough and has potential applications in improving tests for prion diseases , as well as identifying targets against which future drugs should be aimed . "
the researchers believe the method could lead to the identification of abnormal prions in vcjd victims by testing spinal fluid or blood .
their work may also open up new avenues for identifying other similar diseases in animals , such as bse in cattle and scrapie in sheep .
the breakthrough was reported in the scientific journal nature .
' root and branch ' reform meanwhile , one of the uk 's leading food safety experts has blamed the government for the scale of diseases such as bse and foot-and-mouth .
professor hugh pennington , of aberdeen university , says the lessons of the outbreaks have still not been learned .
and he said that without " root and branch reform " , another disaster was waiting to happen .

the move came after the airline agreed not to hire any more foreign pilots this year , while the pilots dropped a demand for an immediate pay rise .
it is fortunate that we were able to reach an agreement to end the crippling strike shim yi-teak , korean air president three out of four hospitals due to join the strike avoided industrial action after reaching overnight agreements .
correspondents say the agreements have broken the momentum of the strike , which had been joined by thousands workers , despite the government declaring it illegal .
the mass action was called in support of improved pay and in protest at the government 's economic restructuring programme , which unions fear will lead to massive layoffs .
' crippling strike ' " it is fortunate that we were able to reach an agreement to end the crippling strike , which has caused so much inconvenience to our customers , " said korean air president shim yi-teak .
most of the airline 's fleet has been grounded during the strike .
a company spokesman said normal operations were not expected to resume until saturday , as the pilots needed time to prepare for duty .
despite the breakthrough at korean air , ground staff at the country 's second largest airline asiana air remain went on strike for a third day , disrupting domestic flights .
" differences between labour and the management are still huge , and both sides failed to meet yesterday , " said asiana spokesman lim jae-chul .
hospital deals but in line with the resolution of the pilots ' dispute , hospitals struck deals to avoid further industrial action .
" workers at 11 hospitals settled disputes over pay and working conditions with management , and only five hospitals are still negotiating with striking workers , " said labour representative lee ju-ho .
some operations at the strike-hit hospitals were cancelled , but emergency and intensive-care units were not disrupted , said mr lee .
