eighteen farms and abattoirs in the uk are now known to be infected , with hundreds more due to be checked .
emergency measures livestock movement ban extended horse racing suspended ireland v wales rugby postponed national parks closed on tuesday night the government revealed a £ 152m rescue package for beef , sheep and dairy farmers , and a scheme to allow the movement of disease-free livestock to abattoirs under licence .
so far , only one case of the disease has been confirmed outside england - at an abattoir on anglesey in north wales .
but the bbc 's kevin bocquet says senior officials at the welsh assembly have expressed growing fears that the number of cases could rise to double figures in the next few days .
he also said there is " little hope " of the outbreak in anglesey , where 3,000 lambs are to be slaughtered , being contained .
the welsh national assembly agriculture committee is meeting later on wednesday to discuss the situation , but its chairman , glyn davies , said he thinks the number of cases in wales could rise to 15 .
motorists driving across the bridges connecting the mainland with anglesey must now drive over disinfected mats , as part of the effort to contain the disease .
another suspected case of foot-and-mouth is being investigated in devon .
if confirmed it would bring the number of cases in the county to four .
click here to see map of confirmed cases leaders of the livestock haulage industry are due to meet the government on wednesday morning to discuss compensation for their loss of business .
it follows the government decision to extend the halt on livestock movements around the uk until at least 16 march to try to halt the spread of the disease .
john hebbs , a specialist livestock haulier from buckinghamshire whose lorries are at a standstill , has told the bbc he will lose up to £ 20,000 a week because of the ban .
under pressure in cheshire , the fear that this latest blow to the farming industry could push some farmers over the edge , has led the local national farmers union to set up a 24-hour suicide alert .
salvation army chaplain keith ineson normally visits farms in person , but he has cancelled his rounds and is now offering a telephone helpline .
the disease is also taking its toll on sporting fixtures , with all horse-racing in england and wales cancelled .
in addition , the rugby union match between ireland and wales in cardiff has been cancelled due to fears that travelling supporters could carry back the infection .
and members of the muslim community have been urged to carry out annual sacrifices - or qurbani - for next week 's eid al kabir festival , outside the country .
footpaths may close agriculture minister nick brown said on tuesday there would be no compensation for hauliers , abattoirs and food processing firms hit by the outbreak .
using government cash to compensate them would be in danger of infringing eu rules , he said .
but he said he hoped the licensed movement of animals would help ease financial pressures on the industry .
" we are doing our very best to help the industry .
the best thing we can do is to extinguish the disease , " he said .
new emergency powers have given councils the authority to close public footpaths and rights of way as a temporary precaution .
it could mean huge swathes of the uk countryside will be out of bounds to the public .

when he accepted the post in 1998 , lord gordon promised to bring a " missionary zeal " to expanding scotland 's tourism market .
but he announced his intention to stand down in november after a troubled year , which saw overseas tourism fall drastically and the resignation of the board 's chief executive , tom buncle .
lord gordon 's decision leaves the board without a chairman at a time when it is still searching for a permanent chief executive .
figures published last year showed the number of foreign visitors coming to scotland fell by 11 % in 1999 .
this prompted the then enterprise minister henry mcleish to commission an independent review of the stb by pricewaterhousecoopers .
the pwc report , which was published in november , recommended a radical shake-up of the board , a cut in the number of directors and a change of name to ' visitscotland ' .
it severely criticised the stb , saying there was " confusion and ambiguity " among senior management .
the criticism proved too much for chief executive tom buncle and he resigned days after the report was made public .
no second term his decision to quit was followed weeks later by lord jimmy gordon 's decision not to seek a second term as chairman .
former civil servant peter mckinlay is currently serving as the interim chief executive of the stb while the search for mr buncle 's replacement is on-going .
the decision to appoint lord gordon 's successor will be taken by enterprise minister , wendy alexander .
lord gordon said he plans to continue as a non-executive of scottish radio holdings .
he also said that he still wants to " write two books " and would like to see an emigration museum in scotland to enable expatriates to trace their roots .

the party has been staging regular anti-government protests in the expectation that the man who is still the party president will be arrested any moment .
the arrest of the former head of the secret service , rade markovic , last friday has fuelled speculation in party ranks that mr milosevic 's arrest will follow soon .
a serbian minister said proceedings against mr milosevic would be initiated but because the authorities wanted the process to be legally watertight it would take time .
mr milosevic is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of crimes against humanity but is being investigated in yugoslavia on suspicion of corruption and abuse of power .
keeping quiet according to belgrade 's media the questioning of mr markovic is going nowhere - at least as far as gathering evidence against mr milosevic is concerned .
mr markovic , a man better placed than most to pass on incriminating evidence against the former president , is apparently keeping silent .
he was head of the secret service from 1998 until the end of last year and is suspected of direct involvement in the attempted murder of leading opposition figure vuk draskovic .
his service is also suspected of carrying out the murder of a well-known journalist who was highly critical of the milosevic regime , and of being behind other killings and disappearances .
protests but a bigger challenge facing investigators trying to build a case against mr milosevic is to prove the former president was involved himself and to get the testimony to make the charges against him stick .
according to the serbian deputy prime minister , zarko korac , the evidence will be found - it is just a question of time and a question of making the case legally secure .
meanwhile mr milosevic 's supporters continue their protests against what they call the government 's witch hunts .
a statement from his socialist party said the recent arrests of mr milosevic 's allies was shameful and politically motivated .
mr milosevic is currently living under police surveillance in his villa in belgrade , which the authorities say does not amount to house arrest .

the welsh development agency has appointed specialist advisers to look at the feasibility of transferring the business of defence air repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- to a new complex a few miles away from rhoose .
the wda said the move would ensure more than 2,000 highly skilled jobs remain in the vale of glamorgan .
dara has been looking at a number of options to replace its ageing facilities at the raf base .
wda chief executive graham hawker said the st athan engineering centre dated back to 1938 and had " serious limitations " .
but he said there was a chance to develop a centre of excellence for the industry near the airport .
up to 165 workers from dara are due to move in a separate development to hampshire .
last december , the government said it was committed to maintaining a " significant " raf jet repair base in south wales , following fears of jobs being relocated to england .
welsh secretary paul murphy and armed forces minister john spellar had met to discuss the future of raf st athan following fears expressed by john smith , mp for the vale of glamorgan .
fully commercial mr smith had raised concerns over possible options being considered by dara to move some staff to the west country or a new site in cardiff bay .
mr spellar said he wanted to reassure employees of the defence aviation repair agency at st athan and the local community .
he explained that one area of change was dara moving to a trading fund status - which meant operations would have to work along fully commercial lines - while remaining in the ownership of the mod .
dara would therefore need to win business contracts in the highly competitive defence market place , he said .
this meant reducing overheads and streamlining its processes in line with industry best practice .
