the talks had to be carried into an extra unscheduled day as the two issues that had dogged the conference - slavery and the middle east - continued to cause problems .
far too much of the time at the conference was consumed by bitter divisive exchanges on issues which have done nothing to advance the cause of combating racism australian delegation the wrangling between delegates continued on saturday even as the conference hall was being packed up and further discussion was only curtailed by a blocking vote .
a bbc correspondent at the conference says that if the final declaration is implemented it will make a radical difference to millions of people .
but some observers asked whether the final documents were worth the trouble stirred up by the conference .
the way was finally cleared for an accord only after the conference voted against syrian demands to include language implicitly accusing israel of racism .
all-night negotiations the two main obstacles to agreement , the middle east and the legacy of slavery , kept delegates up negotiating on the text throughout friday night .
canada , australia , syria , iran and others were deeply unhappy with the declaration 's final text on the middle east conflict - but for different reasons .
for australia , " far too much of the time at the conference was consumed by bitter divisive exchanges on issues which have done nothing to advance the cause of combating racism " .
iran , for its part continued to insist that israel was a racist state : " we should not forget racial practices are made in the occupied palestinian and arab territories . "
european countries did agree to apologise for slavery as a " crime against humanity " , but only after the text was drafted in a way that ensured no legal consequences .
they , along with america , had been keen to make sure that the wording would not make them liable for reparations .
help for millions observers have warned that the lasting impression of the conference may be one of deep disarray .
but according to the bbc 's correspondent in durban , elizabeth blunt , the provisions in the final declaration could make a difference to the daily lives of millions of people suffering from discrimination , if fully implemented .
they urge countries to allow minorities to use their own language , enjoy their own culture and practice their religion freely which at one stroke would satisfy many of the demands of kurds in turkey or tibetans under chinese rule .
they want countries to take a hard look at their criminal justice systems to make sure they do not discriminate against any particular group .
and they call for an end to the culture of impunity , which allows police and other officials to escape the consequences of racist behaviour - a real issue in many countries , and especially in the united states .
breakthrough they urge access to equal education for roma or gypsy children - addressing one of the main grievances of romany communities in eastern europe .
and they tackle the currently contentious issue of migrants , trying to ensure that governments do not discriminate between them on the basis of race .
that could call into question america 's annual green card lottery .
" we have not been deterred from making a breakthrough here in durban , " un human rights commissioner mary robinson said in a closing speech to the conference .
she said it would resonate around the world , especially in communities which still bear the scars of slavery .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- messaging in an instant categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 9 september , 2001 , 07:03 gmt 08:03 uk messaging in an instant radiohead : one of the first bands to try im by click online 's new york correspondent ian hardy instant messaging , once a novelty , is set to take centre stage in the way many of us communicate both at home and at work .
this form of communication is very important in terms of increasing brand loyalty and providing a crucial service for the end user avner ronen , odigo about 100 million people already use some form of instant messaging -lrb- im -rrb- software .
by 2004 , im is expected to be more popular than e-mail as a method of communication .
the big internet companies are at war over this simple service that allows people from all over the world to have text-based conversations with each other in real time .
" in terms of windows xp , in terms of aol , on their television and other internet properties , and yahoo putting it everywhere , it shows you how much importance they give it , " avner ronen at im software company , odigo , told the bbc 's click online programme .
clean , uncluttered interface other players are also looking to put instant messaging on their phones , and cable providers are also looking to put instant messaging on their networks .
" i think the understanding in the market is that this form of communication is very important in terms of increasing brand loyalty , and providing a crucial service for the end user , " says mr ronen .
odigo : one of the im programs available odigo provides instant messaging software to companies like british telecom , but also that can be used on all kinds of devices .
a filtering system allows like-minded people from around the globe to find one another .
odigo , with its animated faces , is a relatively advanced im service .
but for the most part even the most popular services have remained basic and , most surprisingly , commercially free - or close to it .
the average instant messaging interface is still clean and uncluttered .
be my buddy but corporations want to be on your buddy list , coming up with names like smarter child .
add that name to your buddy list and you can chat all day long to your new resourceful virtual friend .
" what 's cool about this is that all you have to do is add one of our screen names to your friends list and you can instantly start talking to it , " says jim pawlika , director of production at active buddy .
if you do n't want to add the name to your buddy list , if you do n't want to interact with the computer do n't , it 's that simple peter levitan , active buddy the british group radiohead is one of the first bands to experiment with this new form of technology .
simply add the name googly minotaur to your buddy list and you can ask radiohead details about their album and tour or take part in a competition .
this might be useful perhaps but it raises several questions , such as whether users should be cautious about giving up personal information during an informal spontaneous exchange .
active buddy , which produces the software that makes all of this happen , says the system is harmless .
" we 've set something up that is 100 % opt-in by the user .
if you do n't want to add the name to your buddy list , if you do n't want to interact with the computer - do n't .
it 's that simple , " says active buddy ceo peter levitan .
" we simply put this option in front of you .
if you 'd rather use the fastest way to get this information , then great .
but if you do n't want to , if you just want to plod along - then be my guest . "
corporate appeal there is no shortage of corporate interest in instant messaging .
i would never want a company to send me an instant message advertisement and as soon as that started i would instantly log off and never use the service again william sanchez , im user shoe company vans and toy shop fao schwarz have both been experimenting with it .
with instant messaging gaining in popularity , companies would like to find a way to initiate casual conversations about their products and services within the im chat boxes .
but for some , this is going too far .
" i hate the idea , " says william sanchez , who keeps in touch with his californian colleagues 2000 miles away from his new york office via yahoo messenger .
" i would never want a company to send me an instant message advertisement and as soon as that started i would instantly log off and never use the service again , " he says .
" i liken it very much to unsolicited phone calls which many people hate - i know i do - and i 'd stop using the service immediately . "
but two things seem inevitable .
instant messaging looks like become the leading method for real-time communications with friends and business associates around the world .
and with its growth , companies will find ways , subtle or otherwise , of getting their share of what is currently the most valuable yet untapped real estate on a computer screen .
