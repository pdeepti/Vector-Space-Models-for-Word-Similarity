the delegation leader eduardo stein told the bbc that the corruption scandals of the past months have left the voters deeply disillusioned with their political classes .
the regaining of the trust of peruvian society in their own institutions is something that will take quite a long time eduardo stein this has not been an easy political transition for peruvians , they are about to go to the polls to vote for their first elected president since alberto fujimori fled to japan last year .
mr fujimori left a corruption scandal that touched virtually every sector of the country 's business and political life .
the details dribbled out in a series of videos showing mr fujimori 's spy chief , vladimiro montesinos , blackmailing and bribing his way through countless businessmen , judges and politicians .
untold damage mr stein says the whole episode has done untold damage to public confidence .
" what they have witnessed in their own tv sets , in their own homes , is of such an enormous proportion , so the regaining of the trust of peruvian society in their own institutions is something that will take quite a long time , " he said .
the effect of past events has created a deep cynicism that is likely to have a direct impact on the government from the moment a winner is declared mr stein says this is likely to affect how the public judges the new government .
" peruvians are not going to grant the new administration a four month , five month , six month grace period , " he said .
tainted by corruption whichever of the two candidates win - alejandro toledo or former president alan garcia - as the national leader , either man will need to prove that they are free of the corruption of old .
but the official investigating the affair , jose ugaz , says the stain runs so deep that it may never fully disappear .
" there have been hundreds of people linked to montesinos and his organisation .
we believe there still are people linked to montesinos that are in some posts as public officers or linked to power , " he said .
without at least a sliver of public faith , any new administration will find it extremely tough to push through the kinds of reforms that peru so desperately needs .

separate hearings lawyers say that hearing evidence in the case will take at least a week .
after the jury has reached a decision on al- ' owhali , a second hearing will take place to decide khalfan khamis mohamed 's fate .
the manhattan jury took 12 days to find the men guilty on all 302 counts against them .

the statement was a reaffirmation of a 11 may warning that american citizens abroad may be the target of a terrorist threat from extremist groups with links to mr bin laden .

they say the special bead-filled cushions should help people suffering from insomnia to sleep better , as well as curing headaches .
their idea is one of many competing for a cash prize in a contest organised by the royal bank of scotland .
a nice cool pillow could be very soothing at any time alan marshall , team leader the team at heriot-watt university are confident they have come up with the ultimate cure for insomnia - pillows filled with special polyacrylic beads .
they are put in the fridge during the day to cool down , then placed under the person 's head in bed at night .
the business students say they came up with the idea during the recent hot spell when one of them could not sleep properly .
they believe a cool pillow is easier to sleep on and also helps calm stress levels and soothe headaches .
its inventors have overcome problems like waterproofing to reach the prototype phase .
the students are from heriot-watt university and the students hope to take it further with university backing if the pillow proves to be commercially viable .
management studies tutor paul winson says they are seeking £ 40,000 in funding to develop the idea into a commercial product .
and he feels that the project has potential .
" the research on the market indicates there is public interest in something like this , particularly among middle class people aged 25 to 45 , " he said .
team leader alan marshall feels it is a simple answer to an ongoing problem .
" many people go to great lengths to get comfortable in bed and enjoy a good night 's sleep .
body temperature " we think this will be useful not only when it 's hot , but a nice cool pillow could be very soothing at any time , " he said .
however , professor jim horne of the sleep research laboratory at loughborough university said he felt the idea was a bit unnecessary .
" i do n't think the problem is any worse over the summer than at any other time of year , " he said .
" i think the temperature of the body would melt the beads in no time at all .
you 'd have to have something cooling going through the pillow all the time .
if people get hot they can just wear fewer bedclothes or get a fan going professor jim horne " cooling the head is a good idea though .
you can cool the body down by cooling the head .
" the blood that flows through the head goes to the rest of the body so if you cool that down then you will cool the body .
" but i think if people get hot they can just wear fewer bedclothes or get a fan going .
i do n't think it 's too much of a problem for people . "
other suggestions which have emerged from the enterprise section of the university course include air-filled bicycle saddles and vending machines for disposable cameras .

the country 's scarce experience of democratic rule means that parliamentarians have few guidelines to help them in their campaign to force mr wahid from power .

wahid dozing in the indonesian parliament instead , it allows the country 's highest legislative body , the people 's consultative assembly or mpr , to hold a special meeting , during which it can demand that the president step down .
under the regime of former president suharto , this was impossible because he appointed half of the 1,000 members of the mpr , and the parliament - which provided the other half - was effectively controlled by the government .
wahid cornered today though , there are only 700 members of the mpr , and most factions in the 500-seat parliament have already decided to push for mr wahid 's removal .
that leaves the embattled president few options .
his threat to impose emergency rule and dissolve parliament last week came to nothing , because neither his cabinet nor the military supported it .
there is still the possibility of violent protests by mr wahid 's supporters , and the likelihood that his almost certain successor , vice-president megawati sukarnoputri , will also face challenges from the parliament in the future .
but the fact that the politicians are still committed to following legal procedures is progress of a sort in a country where the rule of law is so weak .

the country 's scarce experience of democratic rule means that parliamentarians have few guidelines to help them in their campaign to force mr wahid from power .
the 1945 constitution , a sketchy document drawn up in haste at the start of indonesia 's independence struggle 56 years ago , does not actually mention impeachment .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- queen begins state visit to norway low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's jennie bond " the norwegian monarchy is experiencing problems that will be only too familiar " real 56k wednesday , 30 may , 2001 , 06:50 gmt 07:50 uk queen begins state visit to norway the queen receives a warm greeting from king harald the queen is in norway on wednesday on a short state visit to the capital oslo .
she was greeted by norway 's heir to the throne , crown prince haakon , whose forthcoming marriage in august is causing controversy in the country .
the queen , accompanied by the duke of edinburgh , will meet prince haakon 's bride-to-be , mette marit tjessem hoiby - during the one-and-a-half-day itinerary .
the 27-year-old prince has already moved into a luxury apartment with his fiancée - a single mother - whom he intends to marry in august .
controversial wedding the relationship between his parents , king harald and queen sonja , also caused controversy in the past .
when harald fell in love with sonja haraldsen - a commoner - back in 1959 , it was nine years before his father , king olav , gave the royal blessing for a wedding .
but times have changed .
meeting the " controversial " crown prince the norwegian royals feel at home in britain where king harald , now 64 , a former olympic and world-champion yachtsman , studied social science , history and economics at balliol college , oxford .
both britain and norway are constitutional monarchies where the labour party has recently held power .
labour is currently a minority government in norway under prime minister jens stoltenberg .
it is the queen 's third state visit to norway , following visits in 1955 and 1981 .
on this occasion , the queen and prince philip are without the now decommissioned royal yacht britannia , but the royal navy 's flagship , hms illustrious , will arrive in oslo on thursday to support the state visit .

but it wo n't be business as normal for the johannesburg securities exchange -lrb- jse -rrb- .
there will be a gaping hole left behind when trading in de beers ceases on 30 may .
the exchange will lose its largest and most prestigious stock , which accounts for 8.6 % of its market capitalisation and the threat of marginalisation is rearing its head , with an increasing number of companies choosing to list away from their geographical homelands .
string of defections the exchange has already been weakened since 1997 by a string of defections to the london stock exchange by south africa 's biggest mining , computer , brewing and insurance companies .
in fact , the trend seems well established , with billiton , old mutual , south african breweries , liberty life , dimension data and anglo american having already made the move as part of global expansion strategies .
de beers founded by cecil rhodes produces 30m carats of diamonds a year controls nearly half of world production mines in south africa , namibia , botswana and tanzania and several other leading south african firms - the bank investec amongst them - are rumoured to be plotting similar moves .
this not only raises the visibility of the firms in the global arena , it also provides access to larger amounts of capital if needed for acquisitions or other investments .
" it 's now possible to get effective exposure to the south african markets exclusively from london , " one johannesburg analyst told bbc news online , mourning the loss of de beers .
" it 's hard to imagine how this trend can be reversed in the near future , " he added .
bad news the delisting of de beers is bad news for the jse for two reasons .
firstly , it is important for the reputation of the exchange , since de beers is one of the few remaining international firms that is listed locally and is a highly liquid stock .
local investors are already mourning the loss of a company that has been on the jse since 1893 , and analysts agree that it is a big blow to the local market .
only a handful of other jse listed companies - anglo american platinum , impala platinum , anglo gold , gold fields - attract a significant amount of foreign investment .
secondly , it deprives the jse of the listing of the most valuable south african company , and will push down its market capitalisation by member firms - an important measure of the success of stock exchanges .
the jse itself admits that there is a move towards sector rather than nationality based indexes and has linked up with london 's ftse to redesign its indexes and create better visibility of the african markets for global investors .
liquidity boost but it 's not all bad news for investors in johannesburg .
speculation over the buy out of de beers by its sister company anglo american has given the exchange four months of active trading , during which time shares in de beers have risen by a third .
and despite the series of defections , the volume of trading - known as liquidity - continues to rise .
22bn shares traded for the year ending 25 may 2001 compared to 20.9bn during the same period the previous year .
in fact the defections themselves can sometimes boost liquidity in the home market .
anglo american - the buyer of de beers - listed on the london stock exchange in may 1999 .
now , 62 % of all stock transactions are carried out in london .
but a vast increase in the volume of shares traded overall means that the 38 % of trade left in johannesburg is actually greater than the original volume .
currency boost and economists say that , although the privatisation of de beers is overridingly bad news for local markets , it is positive for the economy .
it 's now possible to get effective exposure to the south african markets exclusively from london stock market analyst the buy back of de beers stock will see capital of about $ 3.5bn flow into the country .
some of this is likely to be re-invested in the stock markets , helping to push prices higher .
and a flow of cash will also help ease pressure on the rand .
the jse is the only licensed stock exchange in south africa , with 526 companies making up its all share index .
it ranks fifteenth of all members of the international federation of stock exchanges by market capitalisation .
earlier this week , the jse successfully won unanimous approval from shareholders to proceed with the acquisition of the south african futures exchange .
for more than a century , de beers has sold uncut - or rough - diamonds for cutting and polishing , commanding about two thirds of the global market .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- african bank hit by protests low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 30 may , 2001 , 07:29 gmt 08:29 uk african bank hit by protests mozambique , hit by flash floods in march , won a grant from the afdb the african development bank , which works to reduce poverty and help struggling economies , has become a target of anti-capitalist protestors , despite its popularity amongst the governments of africa 's poorer nations .
combating poverty is the bank 's number one priority the demonstrations have come as a surprise to the continent 's leading financial development institution which began a three-day meeting in valencia in spain on tuesday to find ways to end the plight of africa 's struggling economies .
officials believe the protestors confuse the afdb with the oft targeted world bank group which recently cancelled a poverty conference that had been due to be held in barcelona next month .
" these groups were looking for an opportunistic target after the world bank conference was cancelled .
they found a semblance of an excuse , because the african development bank has been erroneously referred to here in some reports as a subsidiary of the world bank , " a senior bank official said .
struggling economies the afdb meets as economic growth is slowing dramatically on all continents .
and once again , africa is the loser , receiving less aid and less investment from abroad than it did just a few years ago .
ghana this month won a loan to help develop rice fields hampered by regional conflicts , the hiv / aids virus and sub-standard health and education , the afdb has expressed concern at the pace of africa 's development .
for the bank , matters have been made worse by the political unrest in ivory coast 's abidjan where it has its headquarters , forcing it to hold its annual general meeting at this ' emergency temporary location ' in spain .
the lack of stable headquarters is not helpful for the bank which is struggling with a cumbersome leadership structure and a wealth of outstanding funds owed to it by some of the world 's poorest countries this does not make it easier for the bank to achieve its stated goal : to combat poverty and raise cash and other resources to help africa develop , both socially and economically .
success stories afdb 's most recently endorsed projects have included a $ 12.65m loan to mauritania for a fiscal adjustment programme , $ 0.5m of grants for both malawi and mozambique following recent floods , a $ 19m loan to ghana for rice cultivation and a $ 100m loan to develop the information infrastructure sector in morocco the afdb granted mozambique half a million dollars after the floods last year , it approved loans worth $ 2.5bn.
so far this year it has allocated about $ 450m .
having won fairly widespread popularity amongst african people , the bank says that it is puzzled about why it is the target of demonstrators .
a coalition of local anti-globalisation groups - campaigning under the slogan ' another africa is possible ' - have planned a series of events to protest against what it calls " neo-liberal policies " .
but the spanish authorities have banned the demonstrations from outside the conference centre .
rising arrears rising arrears , that is unpaid debts by african member nations , is perhaps the biggest area of concern for those monitoring the progress of the afdb , including the credit agencies standard & poor 's and moody 's .
an analyst briefing ahead of this week 's meeting revealed that arrears rose to $ 1.23bn in 2000 , compared to $ 1.06bn the previous year .
the afdb says that africa is not developing fast enough the bank was brought to the point of collapse in the mid-1990s , when arrears rose sharply and the bank continued to extend loans which some considered to be uncreditworthy - because they were loans to troubled african economies which would , predictably , have problems repaying their debts .
this led some western members to lose confidence in the bank 's management , with many withdrawing financial support .
but tighter controls introduced by the bank 's president , omar kabbaj from morocco , have helped reform the bank , winning back the confidence of outside investors .
the us resumed loans to the afdb last year .
the bank says that a rise in arrears this year will be offset by increased capital reserves .
and it points out that gabon and angola have both completely cleared their arrears this year , after being behind with payments since 1985 .
" our financial situation is very solid .
we remain concerned about arrears , but we think that we have now reached the stage where arrears wo n't go much further , " said mr kabbaj .
attracting investment foreign investment into africa is declining , with the continent winning $ 9.3bn in 2000 compared to $ 9.8bn in 1998 .
in 2000 , africa won just 3.9 % of all foreign direct investment to developing countries , with much of that channelled into the more developed countries of north africa .
to make matters worse , aid to africa is also declining sharply , falling from $ 32 per head in 1990 to $ 19 in 1998 .
leaders of the world bank and the international monetary fund launched an impassioned appeal for more aid to africa in march .
relocation ?
the afdb is majority owned by all 53 african countries .
it was established in 1963 by the organisation of african unity with start-up capital of $ 250 million .
since then it has grown into a $ 33 billion , multinational development bank , with 53 african and 24 non-african members .
abidjan : one of the most developed african countries , is now plagued by political unrest it believes that africa 's development can be best achieved through self-reliance and cooperation among african states , rather than by reliance on outsiders .
it is generally popular with african people for its development work , notably in the fields of health , education and road-building the bank concentrates on poverty reduction through investments in agriculture and rural development , leaving many of the loans for more costly infrastructure such as power , industry , telecommunications and transportation to the likes of the world bank .
amongst items on this week 's agenda is a special seminar on african women in finance and economics and there is also expected to be heated discussion about the location of the bank 's headquarters in ivory coast where there has been political and military unrest for the past eighteen months .

the demonstrations have come as a surprise to the continent 's leading financial development institution which began a three-day meeting in valencia in spain on tuesday to find ways to end the plight of africa 's struggling economies .
officials believe the protestors confuse the afdb with the oft targeted world bank group which recently cancelled a poverty conference that had been due to be held in barcelona next month .
" these groups were looking for an opportunistic target after the world bank conference was cancelled .
they found a semblance of an excuse , because the african development bank has been erroneously referred to here in some reports as a subsidiary of the world bank , " a senior bank official said .
struggling economies the afdb meets as economic growth is slowing dramatically on all continents .
and once again , africa is the loser , receiving less aid and less investment from abroad than it did just a few years ago .
hampered by regional conflicts , the hiv / aids virus and sub-standard health and education , the afdb has expressed concern at the pace of africa 's development .
for the bank , matters have been made worse by the political unrest in ivory coast 's abidjan where it has its headquarters , forcing it to hold its annual general meeting at this ' emergency temporary location ' in spain .
the lack of stable headquarters is not helpful for the bank which is struggling with a cumbersome leadership structure and a wealth of outstanding funds owed to it by some of the world 's poorest countries this does not make it easier for the bank to achieve its stated goal : to combat poverty and raise cash and other resources to help africa develop , both socially and economically .
success stories afdb 's most recently endorsed projects have included a $ 12.65m loan to mauritania for a fiscal adjustment programme , $ 0.5m of grants for both malawi and mozambique following recent floods , a $ 19m loan to ghana for rice cultivation and a $ 100m loan to develop the information infrastructure sector in morocco last year , it approved loans worth $ 2.5bn.
so far this year it has allocated about $ 450m .
having won fairly widespread popularity amongst african people , the bank says that it is puzzled about why it is the target of demonstrators .
a coalition of local anti-globalisation groups - campaigning under the slogan ' another africa is possible ' - have planned a series of events to protest against what it calls " neo-liberal policies " .
but the spanish authorities have banned the demonstrations from outside the conference centre .
rising arrears rising arrears , that is unpaid debts by african member nations , is perhaps the biggest area of concern for those monitoring the progress of the afdb , including the credit agencies standard & poor 's and moody 's .
an analyst briefing ahead of this week 's meeting revealed that arrears rose to $ 1.23bn in 2000 , compared to $ 1.06bn the previous year .
the bank was brought to the point of collapse in the mid-1990s , when arrears rose sharply and the bank continued to extend loans which some considered to be uncreditworthy - because they were loans to troubled african economies which would , predictably , have problems repaying their debts .
this led some western members to lose confidence in the bank 's management , with many withdrawing financial support .
but tighter controls introduced by the bank 's president , omar kabbaj from morocco , have helped reform the bank , winning back the confidence of outside investors .
the us resumed loans to the afdb last year .
the bank says that a rise in arrears this year will be offset by increased capital reserves .
and it points out that gabon and angola have both completely cleared their arrears this year , after being behind with payments since 1985 .
" our financial situation is very solid .
we remain concerned about arrears , but we think that we have now reached the stage where arrears wo n't go much further , " said mr kabbaj .
attracting investment foreign investment into africa is declining , with the continent winning $ 9.3bn in 2000 compared to $ 9.8bn in 1998 .
in 2000 , africa won just 3.9 % of all foreign direct investment to developing countries , with much of that channelled into the more developed countries of north africa .
to make matters worse , aid to africa is also declining sharply , falling from $ 32 per head in 1990 to $ 19 in 1998 .
leaders of the world bank and the international monetary fund launched an impassioned appeal for more aid to africa in march .
relocation ?
the afdb is majority owned by all 53 african countries .
it was established in 1963 by the organisation of african unity with start-up capital of $ 250 million .
since then it has grown into a $ 33 billion , multinational development bank , with 53 african and 24 non-african members .
it believes that africa 's development can be best achieved through self-reliance and cooperation among african states , rather than by reliance on outsiders .
it is generally popular with african people for its development work , notably in the fields of health , education and road-building the bank concentrates on poverty reduction through investments in agriculture and rural development , leaving many of the loans for more costly infrastructure such as power , industry , telecommunications and transportation to the likes of the world bank .
amongst items on this week 's agenda is a special seminar on african women in finance and economics and there is also expected to be heated discussion about the location of the bank 's headquarters in ivory coast where there has been political and military unrest for the past eighteen months .
sources say its new headquarter could be based in ethiopia , tunisia or egypt .

as thousands of mr wahid 's supporters marched on the parliament building in jakarta on wednesday , the country 's two main parties called for him to face an impeachment hearing .
security forces are on alert to block any attempt to storm the parliament building .
in a letter read out at the parliament session , mr wahid strongly denied the allegations of corruption and incompetence made against him .
mps are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of holding an impeachment hearing in the upper house as soon as possible .
just a few hundred metres from the parliament building mr wahid on wednesday opened a poorly attended summit of developing nations - the g-15 gathering .
pro-wahid demonstrations it is estimated that up to 10,000 of mr wahid 's supporters are now in jakarta to stage demonstrations and are threatening a bloodbath .
troop reinforcements have been parachuted into east java , mr wahid 's home province .
the move came after troops fired shots in the air to disperse hundreds of his supporters in the town of pasuruan .
there were also large pro-wahid demonstrations in situbondo , east of pasuruan .
vice-president megawati sukarnoputri would automatically take over from mr wahid if he was voted out of office .
wahid response indonesia 's two main parties - ms megawati 's pdi-p and the former ruling golkar party - on wednesday called for mr wahid to face an impeachment hearing .
earlier the attorney-general cleared mr wahid of any wrongdoing over the two financial scandals which prompted the initial calls for his impeachment .
but mp mudahan hasdi said mr wahid 's letter would do little to redeem the president 's image in parliament .
he previously snubbed the legislature by saying he would not respond to the second censure motion , as required by parliament , angering mps .
wahid ' confused ' in his letter on wednesday , he said he had not replied earlier because he was confused about the accusations against him .
under the constitution , there should be a two-month delay before the special session of the upper house is held .
but it is possible the whole process will be speeded up to avoid prolonging the uncertainty which is paralysing the country .
the president had been trying to win over mrs megawati with a last-minute offer of a power-sharing deal , but it seems she has rejected it .
a senior party official said it was now impossible for any compromise to be reached with the president before the impeachment hearing begins in two months ' time .
mr wahid has threatened to declare a state of emergency so he can dissolve parliament , but senior government ministers , as well as the security forces , have refused to support such a move .
rampage mr wahid 's supporters have vowed to stop attempts to remove him from power by any means .
they say mr wahid is innocent of the allegations of corruption made against him .
already there have been two days of violence in east java .
buildings belonging to opposition organisations have been attacked and even churches set on fire .
the police and military have launched a massive security operation to protect the parliament building and other key areas of jakarta .
they have fired warning shots on several occasions to disperse the crowds .

the demand follows last week 's announcement that nord anglia had won a seven-year contract to run abbeylands school in surrey , specialising in business and enterprise .
if the school is successfully turned around , the company will receive bonus payments .
now the national association of head teachers believes staff at the school should be entitled to a slice of those bonuses .
general secretary , david hart , said that while the union had " reservations " about bringing in private businesses to run state schools members of his union would ultimately be responsible for improving results at the school .
if our members and their teacher colleagues are in that school working their socks off to get it right then in my view they should have a slice of the action david hart he said he would be writing to nord anglia in the next week to put forward the naht 's views .

their bonuses should come out of company profits , not the school 's budget , he added .
change in the law chairman and chief executive of nord anglia education , kevin mcneany , said there would have to be a change in the law before he could offer incentives to public sector teachers in schools with which his firm was involved .
" we would very much like to ' incentivise ' all our staff but we do n't employ them so it would be difficult for us to pay bonuses to people who are not actually employed by the company , " he said .
there was no procedure in place to do that currently in terms of teachers ' remuneration which was enshrined in law , he said .
" we would be urging whichever party forms the next government to amend the legislation so that we would have the opportunity to incentivise our staff , " mr mcneany said .

we have had no unfair advantage ; it has all been fought for chris gent , vodafone chief executive the regulator is understood to be within five weeks of publishing a review into competition in the uk mobile phone market .
the review was prompted by claims that vodafone makes " excessive profits " .
however , the company 's chief executive , chris gent , said oftel 's research had been of " abysmally low quality " .
he said it was out of date and did not reflect investments in third-generation licences .
" persistently high profits " vodafone 's full year figures show that the company nearly doubled pre-tax profits to £ 4bn before goodwill and exceptionals , on underlying turnover of £ 21.4bn.
oftel said in february that vodafone had enjoyed " persistently high profits " which had not been eroded by meaningful competition .
on tuesday , oftel renewed its threat to introduce price controls if it found vodafone was making more profit than it would in a fully competitive market .
mr gent denied that vodafone , which is the world 's biggest mobile telecoms company , had an unfair advantage .
he told the financial times newspaper : " we have had no unfair advantage ; it has all been fought for . "
any move to cap vodafone 's charges could jeopardise its decision to take a break from foreign acquisitions to concentrate on its core business .
more customers vodafone 's results were slightly better than industry analysts had expected , as the company managed to avoid the slump suffered by many of its competitors .
the key reason for the jump in profits , though , is not a fantastic growth vodafone 's existing business , but the result of last year 's purchase of germany 's mannesmann , and the formation of verizon wireless in the us .
vodafone 's earnings before interest , taxation , depreciation and amortisation were ahead of expectations at £ 7bn , compared to £ 5.5bn last year .
however , when exceptional items - such as the purchase of mannesmann - are taken into account , the company made a pre-tax loss of £ 8.1bn , compared to a profit of £ 1.3bn last year .
as a result of the expansion programme , vodafone 's registered customers jumped by more than half .
share slide however , the company 's shares continued their recent slide on tuesday , following the results announcement .
vodafone said it remained the uk 's leading mobile phone operator with a market share of 28 % , claiming one million customers more than its nearest rival .
the group said pre-pay products drove the growth in the uk market , with almost eight million customers at the end of march - about 65 % of vodafone 's uk customer base .
last year 's results were overshadowed by the triumph of its hostile move on germany 's mannesmann .
since then , it has added stakes in mobile phone operations in spain , ireland , switzerland , romania , mexico , china and japan .
many of these acquisitions were made through the issue of new equity , resulting in a significant proportion of shareholders who are not seen as long-term investors .
this creates a constant selling pressure .
third generation risks the declining shares are also due to the heavy debts built up through buying third-generation licences that will allow mobile phone users to surf the net and send e-mails .
vodafone is about to launch the stepping stone to third-generation phones , general packet radio services -lrb- gprs -rrb- , with 3g to follow by the end of 2002 or early 2003 .
vodafone said the product - nicknamed " 2.5g " - would be primarily aimed at the business market .
the company said it plans to spend £ 10bn over the next five years on rolling out 3g services .
however , there is little concrete proof that the new technology will be popular with customers .
