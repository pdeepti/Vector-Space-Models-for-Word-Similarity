nothing else heralds the season of good cheer in germany like the springing up of christmas markets in the last week of november , not even good old santa or " niklaus " as he ’ s called in germany .
and though there are those who might argue that the christmas markets in germany are turning increasingly commercial , nothing beats the festive atmosphere and good cheer at these markets .
a step back in time visiting a christmas market in germany is like stepping into the pages of a medieval christmas picture book with all the frills and quaintness attached .
come november and the market places in german cities and towns resound with the sound of hammering and sawing as carpenters put up timber cabins .
with the beginning of advent , these are decorated with lanterns and branches of fir .
they sell all kinds of traditional christmas merchandise and gifts such as wood carvings , marionettes , candles , lambskin shoes , christmas trees .
tradtional wooden handicrafts and embellishments you can find toys and christmas decorations such as nutcrackers , and hand-blown ornaments .
little figurines wearing handmade clothing called zwetschgenmännlein -lrb- prune people -rrb- are popular .
they 're made of dried prunes and nuts threaded on wire .
they come in a variety of characters : men , women , hunters , chimney sweeps and santas , to name a few .
another best-selling item is the rauschgoldengel or gold foil angels .
these come from the most famous christmas market in the city of nuremberg which has a history of more than 400 years .
dressed in stiff , accordion-pleated foil dresses , the angels serve as tree top ornaments and are mounted on top of the christmas tree in place of a star .
mouth-watering goodies there ’ s no arguing that the goodies at the christmas markets are a hot draw .
hot chestnuts , baked apples , grilled sausages , roasted almonds , spicy gingerbread and marzipan cookies ... just the aroma of these wafting on the air is enough to make you hurriedly buy your christmas tree angels and follow your nose and watering mouth .
glühwein : the feel-good drink the culmination of an authentic german christmas market visit is to wash down the above with glühwein or warm mulled wine .
it ’ s a spiced up beverage made of clove , cinnamon , lemon peel and red wine .
it ’ s the ideal winter drink .
the dark red liquid spreads a warmth in your stomach and goes straight to your head , getting you in the right christmas mood in the bargain .
little wonder then that spirits are high and bubbly at christmas markets . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the festival of light day nine in the dw-world advent calendar picture of the day dw-tv europe live hin % 26 weg - das reisemagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

more than four million children live below the poverty line and experts say it is unlikely the government will be able to achieve its target of eradicating child poverty within a generation .
rising standards , particularly in education and housing have helped tackle inequalities , but poverty remains a major problem according to a report by the joseph rowntree foundation and new policy institute .
report highlights one in five adults live in households with less than 60 % of average income children more likely to live in low-income households 25,000 children gain no grades at gcse government has met target for reducing school exclusion levels by 2002 half of all lone parents had no paid work in 2001 number of adults earning less than national minimum wage dropped from 1m to around 250,000 co-author guy palmer said it was " disappointing " there had been no improvement in the numbers of people living at low incomes since the early 1980s .
" any future reduction will have to depend overwhelmingly on direct government policies , " he said .
the government 's claim to have removed 1.2 million people from poverty in the last parliament is challenged in this analysis of social trends .
shadow social security secretary david willets said this showed the disappointing impact of the government anti-poverty schemes , such as the minimum wage and working families ' tax credit .
improvement signs however the report found there were improvements in nearly half of 50 areas , such as education , housing and unemployment .
for example : less children are leaving school without basic qualifications the number of adults out of work who would like employment has dropped from 5m in 1993 to 3.5m.
housing conditions have improved and mortgage arrears are down substantially compared with a decade ago .
however mr willets blamed " complicated means-testing " for the slow take-up rates of many benefits .
he said : " they -lsb- the government -rsb- need fewer schemes that are better designed to reach those most in need " .
figures queried current figures show that 4m children - or almost one in three - are living in households where the income is below the officially recognised poverty line .
households with less than 60 % of the average income is the officially recognised poverty line .

a ba spokesman has admitted a major review is underway but said , " any talk of job losses is pure speculation " .
" five senior managers will conduct -lsb- the review -rsb- and they have been given a clean sheet of paper and will look at the entire network , " the spokesman said .
ba was struggling to realign its business before the 11 september suicide hijackings made customers reluctant to fly and threw the world 's airlines into crisis .
europe in spotlight since then , ba has cut 7,000 jobs , axed its heathrow to belfast route and trimmed capacity .
overall , capacity is nearly 15 % below the level of november last year .
under the latest review , codenamed the future size and shape project , ba is considering cutting the workforce by up to 10,000 by shedding pilots , cabin crew , managers , overseas workers and engineers , the observer newspaper reported .
at the centre of the spotlight are thought to be loss-making regional operations in birmingham , manchester , glasgow and edinburgh .

ba faces strong competition from budget airlines such as easyjet and ryanair on routes to many european destinations .

the review will run until february 2002 , the ba spokesman said .
losses ahead airline analysts are expecting ba to report losses of about £ 750m for its current financial year , which ends in april 2002 .
it would be the airline 's first loss since its privatisation in 1987 .
passenger numbers have fallen for 10 consecutive months , with the latest figures for november showing a 17.8 % decline on november 2000 .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- argentina in new bid to cut debts categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 10 december , 2001 , 05:33 gmt argentina in new bid to cut debts some opposition politicans want cavallo to resign argentina 's beleaguered economy minister , domingo cavallo , is preparing to announce measures to try to prevent the country defaulting on its massive debts .
he needs to cut the government 's budget deficit in order to persuade the international monetary fund to unblock a vital loan .
the main measure will be the ending of tax breaks to private sector companies , likely to raise about $ 4bn extra for the government .
mr cavallo , who is facing calls from opposition politicians for his resignation , continues to insist that the argentine peso 's peg to the us dollar was not under review .
the country has been hit by recession and social unrest he said that " in the next 60 to 90 days " argentina would overcome all the doubts about its foreign debts , now running at $ 132bn .
" by march we 'll almost be able to leave this chapter behind us , " he said .
the new measures are needed to persuade the imf that the government of president fernando de la rua is serious about balancing next year 's budget .
last week , the imf blocked a $ 1.3bn loan to argentina because of growing concerns over its financial health .
mr cavallo spent the weekend in washington discussing with the imf what was needed to get the money disbursed .
but ending tax breaks or making further budget cuts , seen as necessary to gain argentina financial credibility , will be highly unpopular in a country hit by recession and social unrest .
argentina 's peso has one-to-one parity with the dollar the imf loan , part of a $ 40bn dollar rescue package agreed last december , was frozen on wednesday due to argentina 's repeated failure to meet deficit targets .
argentina wants the imf to unblock the loan because it desperately needs extra money to avoid defaulting .
the country needs to make $ 900m in debt payments this month .
mr cavallo hoped to persuade the imf to unblock the loan to free up other sources of funding too .
last thursday , the world bank and the inter american development bank said they had frozen about $ 1.1bn in loans to argentina until the outcome of the imf talks was known .
the blocking of the loan by the imf dealt a huge blow to confidence in argentina .
mr cavallo said his talks with the imf did not cover argentina 's currency regime .
the argentine peso has been pegged to the us dollar for the past decade , and mr cavallo has repeatedly insisted that fears the government is planning to devalue the currency are unfounded .
the argentine government has been forced to introduce drastic measures to stave off default .
on thursday , it said it planned to use money held in private pension funds to help pay its bills .
and last weekend the government banned argentines from withdrawing more than $ 250 per week from their private bank accounts , to prevent economic fears triggering a run on the banks .
fear also exists that an argentine crisis could affect other countries .
" emerging markets in asia and elsewhere have not suffered too much from this crisis in argentina .
that is because people in have regarded argentina as isolated and not affecting the debt positions , " independent strategies ' bob mckee told the bbc 's world business report .
however , he believes that not only could brazil and chile be hit by a devaluation , but asian countries with huge public sector debts - such as indonesia and the philippines - could also be vulnerable . watch / listen on this story independent strategies ' bob mckee " emerging markets in asia and elsewhere have not suffered too much from this crisis in argentina " financial times ' thomas catan " cavallo is really playing a very high risk game here " old mutual 's suresh sadesivan " this is the endgame " analysis q & a : why argentina ?

he needs to cut the government 's budget deficit in order to persuade the international monetary fund to unblock a vital loan .
the main measure will be the ending of tax breaks to private sector companies , likely to raise about $ 4bn extra for the government .
mr cavallo , who is facing calls from opposition politicians for his resignation , continues to insist that the argentine peso 's peg to the us dollar was not under review .
he said that " in the next 60 to 90 days " argentina would overcome all the doubts about its foreign debts , now running at $ 132bn .
" by march we 'll almost be able to leave this chapter behind us , " he said .
the new measures are needed to persuade the imf that the government of president fernando de la rua is serious about balancing next year 's budget .
last week , the imf blocked a $ 1.3bn loan to argentina because of growing concerns over its financial health .
mr cavallo spent the weekend in washington discussing with the imf what was needed to get the money disbursed .
but ending tax breaks or making further budget cuts , seen as necessary to gain argentina financial credibility , will be highly unpopular in a country hit by recession and social unrest .
the imf loan , part of a $ 40bn dollar rescue package agreed last december , was frozen on wednesday due to argentina 's repeated failure to meet deficit targets .
argentina wants the imf to unblock the loan because it desperately needs extra money to avoid defaulting .
the country needs to make $ 900m in debt payments this month .
mr cavallo hoped to persuade the imf to unblock the loan to free up other sources of funding too .
last thursday , the world bank and the inter american development bank said they had frozen about $ 1.1bn in loans to argentina until the outcome of the imf talks was known .
the blocking of the loan by the imf dealt a huge blow to confidence in argentina .
mr cavallo said his talks with the imf did not cover argentina 's currency regime .
the argentine peso has been pegged to the us dollar for the past decade , and mr cavallo has repeatedly insisted that fears the government is planning to devalue the currency are unfounded .
the argentine government has been forced to introduce drastic measures to stave off default .
on thursday , it said it planned to use money held in private pension funds to help pay its bills .
and last weekend the government banned argentines from withdrawing more than $ 250 per week from their private bank accounts , to prevent economic fears triggering a run on the banks .
fear also exists that an argentine crisis could affect other countries .
" emerging markets in asia and elsewhere have not suffered too much from this crisis in argentina .
that is because people in have regarded argentina as isolated and not affecting the debt positions , " independent strategies ' bob mckee told the bbc 's world business report .
however , he believes that not only could brazil and chile be hit by a devaluation , but asian countries with huge public sector debts - such as indonesia and the philippines - could also be vulnerable .

a high critical report into the nantygwyddon landfill tip questioned the site 's suitability on the side of a mountain above gelli , south wales .
david purchon : phased closure protesters from the pressure group rant have said that rhondda cynon taff council 's plans to keep nantygwyddon open for up to three years are completely unacceptable .
the year-long report had been ordered by the welsh assembly.among its recommendations are calls for an end to the tipping of household waste at the site .
the report 's author david purchon said the tip should be " engineered to a close " .
he added that nantygwyddon was also not suited for disposing of industrial waste and he has urged for more detailed health tests to be carried out .
residents in the mid rhondda area have repeatedly raised concerns about the effects of living in the shadow of the tip .
new strategy mr purchon 's report highlighted that polluted water from the site has flown over the years into an area covering 20,000 households .
members of rant are due to meet with rhondda assembly member geraint davies on monday to reinforce their demands for the tip to be closed immediately .
campaigners want the tip closed meanwhile , rhondda cynon taff councillors are due to discuss a new waste strategy on monday night , which could see the tip closed within three years .

although they are two identifiable locations said to have inspired john ronald reuel tolkien to put pen to paper , they are unlikely to be high on a fame-finder 's trail . "
it 's a huge thing with the three films coming out , and there will be interest in the tolkien connections in birmingham " photographer jonathan berg to make matters worse , tourism bosses in bournemouth say tolkien is not the sort of image they want to promote - despite the fact the author and his wife lived and holidayed in the south coast town .
a spokesman told bbc news online : " tolkien is not exactly attractive to the young these days .
we 're much more likely to promote the fact footballer jamie redknapp comes from bournemouth . "
in essex , where a housing estate 's roads are named after lord of the rings characters , there are attempts to jump on the publicity bandwagon , even though tolkien has no connection there .
' good idea ' recent reports have conjured up images of tolkien fans descending on south woodham ferrers , to steal road signs bearing names like " gandalfs ride " and " great smials " .
" but i do n't think there is any likelihood of fans stealing them , " said a local council spokeswoman .
" the reason why the estate 's roads were named like this has nothing to do with tolkien .
" in the 80s when the estate was built , the council had to think of a set of names for the roads , and when someone mentioned lord of the rings it was considered a good idea . "
for diehard fans , such a misconceived legend about the respected oxford professor might draw them to an area he never visited , but at least the local authority will not be wasting promotional cash to attract the wider film-going public .
nevertheless , while the hype is concentrated on the other side of the world , it has not stopped birmingham - where tolkien spent his early years before going off to fight in world war i - getting in on the act .
for the first time , sarehole mill , close to one of the homes where he lived , is to be open to the public for christmas .
it is said to be one of the earliest locations to inspire tolkien , who was born in south africa in 1892 but was brought back to his mother mabel tolkien 's native birmingham in 1895 .
tolkien trail according to city photographer jonathan berg , who is to include a chapter on tolkien in his book positively birmingham , the young writer would have seen the mill from his bedroom window at 264 wake green road , kings heath .
it is reputed to be the location for what became " the shire " in the trilogy , with the mill close to bilbo baggins ' home at " bag end " .
mr berg points out that with birmingham 's proximity to stratford-upon-avon , there will be tourists who will want to go on the " tolkien trail " .
" it 's a huge thing with the three films coming out , and there will , come next spring , be interest in the tolkien connections in birmingham , " he says .
however , while sarehole might be accessible , one of the inspirations for " the two towers " , the second of the three novels , will not be quite as welcoming .
" this is perrots folly , in edgbaston , which is closed at the moment , and there are bids to try and raise money to make it safe , " said mr berg .
vivid imagination " i went down to take a photograph and although i was on a public road , a security guard tried to stop me taking it .
imagine what it will be like when the coachloads start turning up . "
stonyhurst college , in lancashire 's ribble valley is , however , not a quick coach journey from stratford .
for avid fans it is rich in tolkien 's life history , according to jonathan hewat .
mr hewat , who teaches at the connected st mary 's hall preparatory school , said tolkien penned much of lord of the rings , while visiting one of his sons who was a pupil there .
he said : " the area is dotted with names that are familiar from lord of the rings - shire lane in hurst green , for instance , or the river shirebourn . "
the historical connection has led to the building of the tolkien library at st mary 's hall , which is due to open in the coming months .
tolkien 's vivid imagination undoubtedly sparked the enduring popularity of lord of the rings and the creation of " middle earth " at a cost of millions , in new zealand .
however , without the more humble locations that inspired him , the film tolkien " would have hated " , would never have been made .
despite that , unless the public is prepared to put in more effort than simply parting with their cash at the cinema box office , those " fantasy " locations will go largely unnoticed .

however , jrr tolkien did not look further than england for inspiration .
away from the hype , bbc news online 's david schaffer traces some of the places that led to the story in the first place .
as tourism incentives go , it seems jrr tolkien will not necessarily prove a draw for holidaymakers to visit the uk , despite the new , hugely hyped , trilogy of movies .
tolkien 's fantasy world , etched out in minute detail in the lord of the rings , could lead towns across the country to miss out on opportunities to cash in .
in the fickle world of following in the footsteps of the famous , the fact that the likes of lancashire 's ribble valley and perrots folly in birmingham are far removed from what movie fans will see in the films , could mean no invasion by hordes .
although they are two identifiable locations said to have inspired john ronald reuel tolkien to put pen to paper , they are unlikely to be high on a fame-finder 's trail .
it 's a huge thing with the three films coming out , and there will be interest in the tolkien connections in birmingham photographer jonathan berg to make matters worse , tourism bosses in bournemouth say tolkien is not the sort of image they want to promote - despite the fact the author and his wife lived and holidayed in the south coast town .
a spokesman told bbc news online : " tolkien is not exactly attractive to the young these days .
we 're much more likely to promote the fact footballer jamie redknapp comes from bournemouth . "
in essex , where a housing estate 's roads are named after lord of the rings characters , there are attempts to jump on the publicity bandwagon , even though tolkien has no connection there .
' good idea ' recent reports have conjured up images of tolkien fans descending on south woodham ferrers , to steal road signs bearing names like " gandalfs ride " and " great smials " .
" but i do n't think there is any likelihood of fans stealing them , " said a local council spokeswoman .
" the reason why the estate 's roads were named like this has nothing to do with tolkien .
sarehole mill : open this christmas " in the 80s when the estate was built , the council had to think of a set of names for the roads , and when someone mentioned lord of the rings it was considered a good idea . "
for diehard fans , such a misconceived legend about the respected oxford professor might draw them to an area he never visited , but at least the local authority will not be wasting promotional cash to attract the wider film-going public .
nevertheless , while the hype is concentrated on the other side of the world , it has not stopped birmingham - where tolkien spent his early years before going off to fight in world war i - getting in on the act .
for the first time , sarehole mill , close to one of the homes where he lived , is to be open to the public for christmas .
it is said to be one of the earliest locations to inspire tolkien , who was born in south africa in 1892 but was brought back to his mother mabel tolkien 's native birmingham in 1895 .
tolkien trail according to city photographer jonathan berg , who is to include a chapter on tolkien in his book positively birmingham , the young writer would have seen the mill from his bedroom window at 264 wake green road , kings heath .
the house where tolkien lived with his mother it is reputed to be the location for what became " the shire " in the trilogy , with the mill close to bilbo baggins ' home at " bag end " .
mr berg points out that with birmingham 's proximity to stratford-upon-avon , there will be tourists who will want to go on the " tolkien trail " .
" it 's a huge thing with the three films coming out , and there will , come next spring , be interest in the tolkien connections in birmingham , " he says .
however , while sarehole might be accessible , one of the inspirations for " the two towers " , the second of the three novels , will not be quite as welcoming .
" this is perrots folly , in edgbaston , which is closed at the moment , and there are bids to try and raise money to make it safe , " said mr berg .
vivid imagination " i went down to take a photograph and although i was on a public road , a security guard tried to stop me taking it .
imagine what it will be like when the coachloads start turning up . "
stonyhurst college , in lancashire 's ribble valley is , however , not a quick coach journey from stratford .
for avid fans it is rich in tolkien 's life history , according to jonathan hewat .
mr hewat , who teaches at the connected st mary 's hall preparatory school , said tolkien penned much of lord of the rings , while visiting one of his sons who was a pupil there .
he said : " the area is dotted with names that are familiar from lord of the rings - shire lane in hurst green , for instance , or the river shirebourn . "
the historical connection has led to the building of the tolkien library at st mary 's hall , which is due to open in the coming months .
tolkien 's vivid imagination undoubtedly sparked the enduring popularity of lord of the rings and the creation of " middle earth " at a cost of millions , in new zealand .
however , without the more humble locations that inspired him , the film tolkien " would have hated " , would never have been made .
despite that , unless the public is prepared to put in more effort than simply parting with their cash at the cinema box office , those " fantasy " locations will go largely unnoticed .

historic scotland teams will start work in the grounds of linlithgow palace on monday .
they are hoping to find the remains of the fort built by edward i in 1302 and destroyed by robert the bruce after the battle of bannockburn .
the area has a rich history the fort was the scene of scotland 's own " trojan horse " incident , when a small number of scots - inspired by bruce - leapt out from a cart of hay and slaughtered the english garrison .
nick bridgeland of historic scotland said it was hoped that the dig in the park surrounding the palace would uncover artefacts and timber fortifications built by the english monarch .
he said : " we know that edward i built a massive fortification at linlithgow in 1302 in the midst of the scottish wars of independence .
" it was a huge mound , making full use of the natural geology of the site , and cutting a giant ditch between himself and the town to protect himself from attack .
" it was seen as a good place from which to control scotland .
it was simple military tactics . "
any visible ruins of the fortress were destroyed by james i - who rebuilt the existing linlithgow palace after it was destroyed by fire in 1424 .
the initial dig will last until march some 1,000 square metres of land will scoured in an effort to find evidence of the fort .
the area is believed to have been inhabited since before roman times , and the site of the 15th century palace existed as a manor from the 12th century .
mr bridgeland said : " we could turn up artefacts dating from roman times to evidence of a glue factory which we know was demolished in the 19th century . "
he added : " the first aim of the excavation is to identify the scope of what is underneath the ground . "
the dig is due to be completed by march , when more specific excavations will take place to build on the initial reconnaissance . watch / listen on this story bbc scotland 's kate fawcett " historic scotland is eager to discover if the land holds any secrets " see also : 26 may 01 -pipe- scotland nuts give clue to ' oldest ' scots site 14 sep 00 -pipe- scotland skara brae usurped as oldest site 19 may 00 -pipe- europe turkish dam threatens roman dig 14 mar 01 -pipe- scotland ancient chariot found in edinburgh 15 nov 00 -pipe- sci / tech iron age scotland ' put milk in its porridge ' internet links : historic scotland linlithgow palace - marie stuart society the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top scotland stories now : new powers call for donor cards girl 's death sparks major inquiry north sea rig hit by explosion killer faces wife assault charge rapist jailed over murder bid scots killed in alps fall national park ' goes live ' security van raid tip-off links to more scotland stories are at the foot of the page .
