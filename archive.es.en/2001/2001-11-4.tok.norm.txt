the agreement to station us troops in uzbekistan came during an october visit by the defence secretary , but their role is limited to search-and-rescue operations .

" we have been often told in the past that the abm treaty is a relic of the cold war .

us summit mr ivanov 's comments , along with other upbeat remarks by officials , suggested that agreement on the treaty could be reached in time for a us summit between president putin and george w bush , due on 13-15 november .
talks between mr rumsfeld and mr ivanov centred on the two countries ' co-operation in the military offensive , and also the question of arms control .

they are taking part in an international scheme designed to bring some joy to poor and disadvantaged children at christmas .
last year four million shoe boxes were sent around the world under the scheme , operation christmas child , which is run by the christian relief and evangelism organisation samaritan 's purse .
many schools hand out leaflets at this time of year , telling children how they can make up a box .
children in former soviet republics like azerbaijan receive the gifts the children wrap up a mixture of toys , pencils , paper and sweets as well as some toiletries or small items of clothing such as hats .
the boxes have to be handed in for collection by the middle of november .
the president of samaritan 's purse , franklin graham says the scheme brings a lot of joy .
" i wish everyone could see the smiles of the millions of grateful children as their faces light up as they dig through their boxes , " he said .
operation christmas child began in 1990 , after the fall of romania 's president ceaucescu .
the first christmas shoe boxes were sent to romania .
last year , 727,606 of the decorated boxes were sent out from the uk and the irish republic .
people in the usa are the biggest contributors to the scheme and last year packed about three million boxes .
there were six children and there was a box for each of them and the father said to me ' you are like angels visiting my children ' david applin , samaritan 's purse the boxes are sent all over the world , to south america , african countries , eastern europe and the former soviet republics .
many go to orphanages or schools for children with disabilities as well as to poor families .
the executive director of operation christmas child in the uk and ireland , david applin , has often travelled with some of the charity 's volunteers when the boxes are distributed .
he says the boxes bring a lot of joy to needy children .
" there are children standing in romania in the middle of winter with nothing on their feet , in thin summer dresses .
" i remember going to deliver some boxes to a farm in romania .
" there were six children and there was a box for each of them and the father said to me ' you are like angels visiting my children ' . "
afghanistan this christmas , samaritan 's purse will send shoe boxes with relief aid to children in afghanistan and the refugee camps around the country .
david applin said : " sending to areas like this , it is good if people include things like toothpaste , soap and even woollen hats in the shoe boxes . "
the organisation says it is not only church schools which support the scheme , and that it receives a large number of contributions from non-denominational schools or from non-christian faith schools .
mr applin said : " we do want to get the message over that god 's greatest gift is his son , jesus , but the people who receive the shoe boxes are not put under pressure to go to church . "
he said those who receive the gifts are chosen by samaritan 's purse partners in the countries involved - normally a church group .
the organisers believe the children who do the giving also get a lot out of the scheme .
" they learn to give rather than just receive and families can have the feeling that they have helped someone else . "
