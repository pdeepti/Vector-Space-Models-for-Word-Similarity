the findings , from a survey by the alcohol and health research centre , fuel the debate over the " culture " of drinking , smoking and taking drugs in this country .
there has been a slight decline in illicit drug use since the last survey of this kind in 1995 .
but uk teenagers were still more likely than most europeans to have taken a variety of illicit substances .
uk teenagers ' drug and alcohol use ever been drunk : 75.8 % cannabis : 35.4 % amphetamines : 7.7 % magic mushrooms : 5.1 % ecstasy : 3.3 % cocaine : 3.2 % heroin : 2.7 % they were also well ahead of other most european nations in terms of binge drinking , and regular daily smoking .
the principal drug of choice for uk children was cannabis , with just over 35 % of 15- to 16-year-olds having tried it .
just under 65 % had smoked conventional cigarettes , while more than 75 % confessed to having been drunk at some time .
other drug use was far less frequent : 15 % had abused aerosols , glue or other " volatile substances " , 8 % had taken amphetamines and 3.3 % ecstasy .
harder drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were less common .
but the report 's author dr martin plant , from the edinburgh-based centre , said : " one of the problems we have is that drug taking has now become so commonplace that it is widely regarded as socially acceptable . "
brian idden mp , chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on drug abuse , called for a " complete rethink " of anti drug and alcohol policy in the uk .
he said : " we need to have a national strategy in britain for alcohol , tobacco and drugs . "
he said that he had heard of children as young as eight in his constituency of bolton who were drinking and using cannabis .
" we can point out the health risks to young people - and i do n't think these are pointed out enough in this country . "
drunken children the results were also worrying reading for charities trying to stem the tide of teenage drunkenness in the uk .
nearly 30 % of the sample of 15- and 16-year-olds said they had been drunk at least 20 times in their life - a quarter said they had been intoxicated three or more times in the past month .
the charity alcohol concern said the findings backed their own experience , and they called for tighter enforcement of anti-underage drinking laws .
a spokesman said : " drinks such as alcopops are targeted at young people because they 're sweet , and often young people do n't realise how much alcohol is in them .
" we just want to see the existing laws enforced properly when they have been broken by people selling alcohol to underage drinkers .
" this group of young people is drinking more and drinking more frequently , " he said .
the results are to be presented to the european conference on alcohol taking place in copenhagen this week .
world health organisation director general gro harlem brundtland has already condemned alcohol companies for aggressively marketing their products to young people .
smoking figures uk teenagers are also among the most prolific smokers in the 30 european countries surveyed .
more girls than boys admitted smoking , and in total , 34 % of children said they had smoked during the past month .
clive bates , of action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- , said the key to stopping teenagers smoking was to reduce adult smoking .
he said : " the danger for these children is that they will completely underestimate how difficult it is to give up smoking . "
paul boateng , minister for children and young people , said the government had put in place a 10-year strategy to tackle drug misuse , and new proposals to tackle under-age drinking were currently before parliament .
in addition , ministers were committed to improving standards in education , to reform of the youth justice system and had introduced the new deal for the young unemployed .
but he said : " this can not just be a matter for government .
encouraging more responsible behaviour amongst the young is a matter for us all - parents , teachers , friends and communities . "

much of the increase involves payments made over the internet or the telephone , and could hit consumer confidence in e-commerce .
credit cards were not made to function on the internet commission source the european commission says it is determined to stop the fraud , which accounted for 600 million euros -lrb- $ 553m -rrb- in illegal transactions in europe last year .
an eu spokesman said that while e-commerce sales were buoyant , their potential was " inhibited by lack of confidence in the privacy and security of payment transactions performed over the internet " .
recent data has shown that internet transactions represent only 2 % of all credit card usage , but account for half of customer complaints .
the ease of internet crime the anonymity of the internet enables criminals to make cross-border purchases with stolen credit card details at relatively little risk of being caught .
on monday , the commission launched a three-year plan to tackle credit card fraud .
the plan includes a new toll-free number across europe for consumers who have lost their credit cards or been online fraud victims .
new technical measures are also being developed to prevent fraud , such as electronic chips in credit cards .

much of the increase involves payments made over the internet or the telephone , and could hit consumer confidence in e-commerce .
credit cards were not made to function on the internet commission source the european commission says it is determined to stop the fraud , which accounted for 600 million euros -lrb- $ 553m -rrb- in illegal transactions in europe last year .
an eu spokesman said that while e-commerce sales were buoyant , their potential was " inhibited by lack of confidence in the privacy and security of payment transactions performed over the internet " .
recent data has shown that internet transactions represent only 2 % of all credit card usage , but account for half of customer complaints .
the ease of internet crime the anonymity of the internet enables criminals to make cross-border purchases with stolen credit card details at relatively little risk of being caught .
on monday , the commission launched a three-year plan to tackle credit card fraud .
the plan includes a new toll-free number across europe for consumers who have lost their credit cards or been online fraud victims .
new technical measures are also being developed to prevent fraud , such as electronic chips in credit cards .
major payment organisations such as visa , american express and mastercard have already started working together to raise security standards on the internet .
" credit cards were not made to function on the internet , " said a commission source .
" there is a real need of safer payment systems that we hope the industry will deliver . "

the canadian director has had tentative discussions on the subject with the russians , major partners in the $ 60bn iss project .
cameron told the bbc such a movie could help to recapture the enthusiasm for space exploration felt by everyone on earth when neil armstrong stepped on to the moon in 1969 .
it 's technically feasible but it would be very expensive james cameron he said : " if such a thing proves to be possible , i think some filmmaker should go .
" it should be someone who is dedicated to the cause of trying to popularise space flight again because the public has lost its passion . "
cameron talked about his desire to go into orbit at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- .
he was chairing a seminar on the human exploration of space , which included speakers from the american space agency nasa and lockheed martin .
the director said he would not go through with the film project unless he was absolutely sure he had a winning idea .
space tourist he said : " it 's technically feasible but it would be very expensive .
" so , the question is , can you justify it with a commercial project that pays for itself ?
i do n't want to go if it ca n't be profitable .
" that sounds very mercenary but you have to make the clear distinction between space tourism , which is about having an experience for your own gratification , and going as a filmmaker to interpret the experience of space travel for everyone on earth who ca n't go and have it for themselves .
" this is the major disconnect in the professional space programmes .
they are n't able to captivate the imagination of the public . "
cameron was linked at one stage with the possibility of doing a movie on the mir space station .
the private company that had the commercial rights to mir actively sought novel ideas for the platform 's use from the entertainment industry .
next stop mars a us tv network had discussions about doing a " reality show " based around mir .
but nothing came of the plans because the russian government decided to scuttle the 15-year-old station , which was struggling with numerous system failures .
it is not known how the americans would react to the idea of cameron making a movie on the iss .
the us , which is the major partner in the 16-nation space construction project , has already expressed dissatisfaction with the russian authorities for sanctioning the visit of a tourist to the platform .
dennis tito , a multi-millionaire , has bought a ticket that could see him board the iss in april .
cameron 's desire to visit the iss is borne out of his passion for space .
he would like to make a film that really got behind what it was like to be an astronaut .
titanic won 11 oscars he said : " you have to get behind the eyes of the people that go there , the people that dedicate their lives to being astronauts .
" what does being in space do to you day after day ?
what does it do to you being in that kind of a confined space ?
" what does it do to you being away from your loved ones , away from planet earth , in a fundamentally different environment than the one you were evolved to be in ?
" how does that improve you , how does it erode you ? "
cameron said everyone should sit up and take notice of the iss , which he said was an extraordinary project and one he hoped would be a stepping stone to mars .
he said : " if there was a way to rekindle the kind of human bond that we had with each other at the moment neil armstrong stepped on to the moon , then i think people would get behind it .
" when the iss comes to the end of its construction phase and goes into a maintenance period , then mars could step right into its shoes .

hostage takings have attracted media attention to the rebels the armed conflict between muslim separatists and the army in the southern philippines has continued since the days of martial law under former president marcos nearly 30 years ago .

the main rebel group , the moro national liberation front , used to receive training and , allegedly , weapons from libya .
autonomy but in 1996 the mnlf signed a peace agreement with the government in return for the creation of an autonomous muslim region to be run by members of the rebel group .
however , two splinter groups remained outside that agreement : the larger moro islamic liberation front , or milf , has continued to wage an armed campaign against the philippines military and controls sizeable areas of the island of mindanao with the support of the local muslim population .
the smaller and more radical abu sayyaf group operates in the sulu islands , to the south-west of mindanao , which have a long tradition of piracy and kidnapping .
it was the abu sayyaf which abducted a group of foreign tourists from nearby malaysia last year .
many muslims have continued to support the milf because they are disappointed by the lack of economic development in the autonomous region .
the army increased its attacks on the milf last year , in part because of its concern over the increased strength of the rebel group but also because then-president joseph estrada believed that a tougher approach would increase his popularity .
but despite some successes , the army has been unable to crush the rebels and has in the process made itself very unpopular with the muslim community in the south .

lord irvine , who as head of the judiciary has the power to appoint qcs and judges , sent letters to solicitors and barristers inviting them to a labour party fundraising dinner he was hosting at a london restaurant .
he has no one to blame except himself shadow lord chancellor lord kingsland the tories have accused lord irvine of jeopardising the impartiality of his office by seeking donations and have called on him to resign .
the shadow lord chancellor , lord kingsland , has backed the resignation call , saying : " i think it is highly undesirable that the lord chancellor should be drawn into the party political arena in this way .
" but he has no one to blame except himself . "
tory mp michael fabricant has written to the chairman of the public standards committee , lord neill , asking him to investigate the lord chancellor 's conduct .
solid support a spokesman for the committee said on tuesday morning that the complaint had still to be examined .
he added , however , that the committee did not investigate specific complaints against individuals .
the government is standing solidly behind lord irvine , despite mounting political pressure and a deep unease among many lawyers .
downing street has dismissed suggestions that lord irvine should resign .
with the commons not sitting this week , an attempt was made by tory peers to raise what they are calling the " cash for wigs " affair in the lords on monday .
this was blocked by ministers but opposition peers will try again on wednesday .
the incident , which has caused some disquiet among government backbenchers , is the latest allegation of sleaze to hit labour following the hinduja passport row that brought down northern ireland secretary peter mandelson .
home office minister paul boateng dismissed the suggestion that lord irvine had abused his role as " absolutely absurd " .
he told bbc news that the office of lord chancellor had always combined political and judicial roles but these were kept completely separate .
he described lord irvine as an " exemplary politician and an exemplary lawyer " .
but tory chairman michael ancram accused lord irvine of breaching the trust placed in him and bringing the integrity of his office into question .
he urged lord irvine to resign from his post .
' highly undesirable ' speaking to bbc news , shadow lord chancellor lord kingsland said the issue was that lord irvine had to be seen to be acting with the utmost probity and that was what was being called into question by his conduct .
at the dinner , lord irvine 's letter explained , the lawyers would be asked to pledge at least £ 200 " in order to secure a second term for labour " .
mr ancram has written to prime minister tony blair asking him to review lord irvine 's position .
the tory chairman said : " in order to protect the integrity of the office of lord chancellor , there is in my view no other option but for lord irvine to resign .
" i find it very difficult to see how a lord chancellor can claim to be independent when he is going out effectively as the begging boy for labour . "
sir michael davis , a former high court judge , said : " he has earned the ttitle lord banana skin . "
he added : " he has done something that anybody must have realised was totally wrong .
he must not solicit money from anyone he could give an appointment to . "
overhaul the row has added fresh impetus for the office of lord chancellor to be overhauled .
many believe that the office should be replaced by a ministry of justice headed by an mp who is accountable to the commons , as opposed to the lords .
labour peer baroness kennedy said the row showed the role of the lord chancellor needed to change .
" most people would say there has been absolutely no wrongdoing here .
" the problem is there is a blurring of the lines . "
