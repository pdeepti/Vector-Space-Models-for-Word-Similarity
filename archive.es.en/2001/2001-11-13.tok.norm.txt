the northern alliance has been buoyed by the us campaign the dramatic advances by the afghan northern alliance are a great boost for the us-led campaign against the taleban but it may make the search for a stable post-taleban government more difficult .
the alliance is a multi-ethnic opposition group , which was plagued by internal dissent when it governed , but is now united in its desire to topple the ruling taleban .
it was thought masood 's death could mean the end of the northern alliance the alliance is primarily comprised of three non-pashtun ethnic groups - tajiks , uzbeks and the hazaras - and in the past relied on a core of some 15,000 troops to defend its territories against the predominantly pashtun taleban .
in early september the alliance was dealt a critical blow by the assassination of leader general ahmed shah masood , who had been integral in forging alliances with former opponents and maintaining the co-ordination of a patchwork of guerrilla fighter units .
but general masood 's skill had not translated into significant military achievement on the ground .
the alliance had controlled just under 5 % of afghanistan - the panjshir valley , stronghold and birthplace of general masood , and a small enclave in the mountainous north-east .
it was the us decision to back the northern alliance in its efforts against the taleban - including the bombardment of taleban front line positions - which marked a major reversal of the alliance 's fortunes .

it has taken just a few days for the islamist militia to abandon its hard-fought gains .
there are a number of reasons for this .
first and foremost , of course , is the relentless pounding of taleban positions by american bombers and cruise missiles .
this , in a sense , is a mirror image of the pakistani support the taleban received during their conquest of kabul and the north in the 1990s .
pakistan did not bomb from the air , or provide overt ground troops .
but funding , logistics and irregular military support proved crucial for the islamic students ' militia to take territory outside of its ethnic heartland in kandahar .
with that support from islamabad withdrawn after the 11 september attacks , the taleban became vulnerable to northern alliance forces they had once repulsed with ease .
then there is the ethnic factor .
in general , especially in the bitter , warlord-ridden days of the mid-1990s , pashtun afghans welcomed the taleban advance .
even if they did not share the group 's austere and rigid version of islam , pashtuns were pleased with the peace and security that accompanied the taleban .
the group disarmed and often punished local warlords who had plagued afghans for years .
restrictions on women the restrictions on women and other strictures in the name of islam were not particularly different from tribal and village practice in many of these places .
only the urban population had ever allowed women a role in public life .
it was only the gradual disappearance of foreign development aid - as agencies found taleban restrictions unworkable - that made ordinary people aware of how damaging the islamist militia 's policies were .
the taleban did not consider kabul a particularly important place .
all important decisions were made in kandahar , the militia 's southern stronghold , by mullah omar akhund , the group 's reclusive leader .
in fact , taleban officials sent to be government ministers in kabul were often seen as slightly suspect , too urban or cosmopolitan , and were often reshuffled or sent back to the provinces .
the machinery of government - ministries , buildings , civil servants - were in the capital , the power lay in kandahar .
taleban grip weakens in the end , the taleban did what every other group to rule afghanistan has done - concentrated on a power base and cobbled together support in other areas by using money , military might , terror , and in some cases , improvements in government and development activities - at least , relative to the past .
it is not a formula for stable government .
thus , when the americans bombed and the northern alliance advanced - flush with new weapons and presumably cash from russia , india , iran and other allies - the taleban collapsed .
first mazar-e-sharif , a largely uzbek and tajik city that was never comfortable with taleban rule , then other towns like pul-e-khumri , taloqan , maimana , dast-e-qila and herat .
none of these places were taken by taleban forces without immense logistical support from pakistan and funds from saudi arabia .
neither of those countries support them anymore .
the question now , and the real fear of neighbouring countries , donor nations , the united nations and afghan civilians - is whether the northern alliance will be magnanimous in victory or triumphalist and vengeful .
threat of more chaos looting is already being reported .
the question is how long it goes on .
alliance soldiers have fought with minimal resources for years and can hardly be expected to ignore the temptations of a well-stocked bazaar in what was once an enemy-held city .
so far - as american bombs rained down - the political side of the afghan equation has made little progress .
attempts to put former king zahir shah at the centre of things failed , and attempts to set up a pashtun alternative to the taleban are still at an early stage .
now the advance of the northern alliance has added a huge sense of urgency to this process .
the coming days will be crucial if afghanistan is not to sink into another round of warlord-driven civil war .
or worse - the de facto division of a proud and ancient land into mutually hostile ethnic enclaves .

ian gibbons heads up invest.uk efforts in the us but there is a larger purpose as well .
invest.uk , the inward economic-development agency of the british government , is keen on helping american businesses in setting up or expanding their operations from a british base .
last year alone , invest.uk , through its involvement with comdex , convinced 35 american firms to take a look at britain as a way to expand operations on to the european continent .
thirty-three percent of all firms looking to expand in europe enter via britain , the agency says .
this year more than any other , invest.uk felt its presence was important , given the recent tragic events in new york and washington , said ian gibbons , deputy directory invest.uk usa .
reaffirming commitments one reason british business has rallied behind america - both politically and economically - is that it has also suffered from the 11 september attacks .
over 150 british citizens were lost when the trade towers collapsed , mr gibbons told bbc news online , adding that many uk citizens lived and worked in the us - 50,000 in new york city alone .
tessa is a pilot programme to assist deaf customers at the post office in the days immediately following the crashing of hijacked commercial aircraft into the trade towers and the pentagon , the british government underlined its commitment to the us through military and political alliances .
so did british business .
taking its cue from new york mayor rudolph giuliani , who urged new yorkers and americans to get on with their lives , a scheduled ukinny festival took place in october , showcasing the best that british business had to offer .
key business ally the us and britain are key allies .
each is the single biggest investor in the other 's economy .
it is a collaboration that has helped american companies launch enterprises in other parts of europe , using the uk as launching pad on to the european continent .
and in the case of technology partnership , that is especially evident in the uk 's significant participation in comdex this week .
while the number of firms and participants at this year 's tech trade show is significantly less than in previous years , invest.uk has its largest contingent ever , according to invest.uk 's gibbons , with nearly 20 uk firms exhibiting along with more than a dozen universities , and research and development firms .
unique british business among them is the university of east anglia , which has on display its tessa project .
tessa , which stands for text and sign support assistant , was developed to assist people who are deaf or hard of hearing in transactions at a post office .

but there is a larger purpose as well .
invest.uk , the inward economic-development agency of the british government , is keen on helping american businesses in setting up or expanding their operations from a british base .
last year alone , invest.uk , through its involvement with comdex , convinced 35 american firms to take a look at britain as a way to expand operations on to the european continent .
thirty-three percent of all firms looking to expand in europe enter via britain , the agency says .
this year more than any other , invest.uk felt its presence was important , given the recent tragic events in new york and washington , said ian gibbons , deputy directory invest.uk usa .
reaffirming commitments one reason british business has rallied behind america - both politically and economically - is that it has also suffered from the 11 september attacks .
over 150 british citizens were lost when the trade towers collapsed , mr gibbons told bbc news online , adding that many uk citizens lived and worked in the us - 50,000 in new york city alone .
in the days immediately following the crashing of hijacked commercial aircraft into the trade towers and the pentagon , the british government underlined its commitment to the us through military and political alliances .
so did british business .
taking its cue from new york mayor rudolph giuliani , who urged new yorkers and americans to get on with their lives , a scheduled ukinny festival took place in october , showcasing the best that british business had to offer .
key business ally the us and britain are key allies .
each is the single biggest investor in the other 's economy .
it is a collaboration that has helped american companies launch enterprises in other parts of europe , using the uk as launching pad on to the european continent .
and in the case of technology partnership , that is especially evident in the uk 's significant participation in comdex this week .
while the number of firms and participants at this year 's tech trade show is significantly less than in previous years , invest.uk has its largest contingent ever , according to invest.uk 's gibbons , with nearly 20 uk firms exhibiting along with more than a dozen universities , and research and development firms .
unique british business among them is the university of east anglia , which has on display its tessa project .
tessa , which stands for text and sign support assistant , was developed to assist people who are deaf or hard of hearing in transactions at a post office .
tessa combines speech-recognition technology and virtual human animation to enable postal clerks to communicate with deaf customers , using british sign language .
last summer , the system was on display at the science museum of london and was simultaneously on trial at the post office there .

north korea had claimed the alert was aimed at the communist state .
careful language the new reunions will take place on 10 december at mount kumgang , a scenic resort in the north .
delegates from both sides were meeting at the resort in talks which opened on friday .
the talks were extended by a day into tuesday as the two sides stumbled over the nature of the south 's security alert .

the deputy health minister said on monday that he was intending to fight education minister jack mcconnell for the party 's top job .
but the race to succeed henry mcleish as first minister took another twist on tuesday when he confirmed he will not now stand after failing to secure enough backing .
that leaves early favourite mr mcconnell as the sole candidate , although interested msps have until 1700 gmt on tuesday to lodge an official nomination .
candidates need the backing of seven msps before they can be put to the vote .
mr chisholm believed that he could have secured enough votes to go forward - but that he did not have enough committed support to mount a serious challenge .
it had also been anticipated that mr mcconnell would face competition from enterprise minister wendy alexander , but she announced on sunday that she had decided not to stand .
the reality is i was not getting sufficient support malcolm chisholm mr chisholm said he had entered the contest when it looked likely that ms alexander would challenge mr mcconnell .
" i wanted to give people further choice .
clearly the situation has changed , " he said .
" however , the reality is i was not getting sufficient support . "
labour msp john mcallion is , however , still seeking support in an effort to mount a challenge .
he told bbc scotland : " if i can get seven nominations i certainly would stand , but i ca n't get into the race never mind withdraw from it .
affair with colleague " i ca n't get the seven nominations , that 's the problem . "
he said his candidacy would be about raising issues like the private public partnership and opening up water and sewerage to competition and finding out the party 's views on the subjects .
meanwhile , the education minister is preparing to host a " clear the air " news conference on tuesday to deal with allegations about his private life .
it is thought that he will confirm that he had an affair with a party colleague seven years ago .
i ca n't get into the race , never mind withdraw from it john mcallion however , it is being stressed that his wife bridget is fully aware of events and that the couple have long been reconciled .
mr mcconnell believes his bid to take over from mr mcleish as first minister could become hampered by innuendo .
newspapers have been promising intense scrutiny of candidates for the labour leadership with some hinting that the education minister 's private life may become an issue .
mr mcconnell said he would fight an " open and honest " campaign based on ideas and policies north of the border .
those putting themselves forward have until 1700 gmt on tuesday to declare their candidacy .
if no-one else comes forward to challenge mr mcconnell there would be an affirmatory ballot in which his party colleagues would be asked to say whether or not they supported the candidate .
however , if a challenger comes forward the winner will be declared early next month following three official hustings meetings and a ballot of the membership .
the new leader would then go before the scottish parliament on thursday 6 december to be endorsed as first minister .
it would normally take the party three months to elect a new scottish leader but the scotland act requires that a new first minister be in place within 28 days .

the big threat for us and for the russians is not each other , but somebody developing weapons of mass destruction president bush president bush told russian journalists there was no need for long discussions and he expected mr putin would produce plans to scale back russia 's nuclear arms .
the us president said he would also argue that the existing anti-ballistic missile treaty was outdated because it prevented the development of defensive weapons systems that reflected real threats .
mr bush praised mr putin , saying they were close to forging a relationship that would outlive their presidencies .
mr putin is on a three-day visit to the us which will include meetings at president bush 's ranch in texas .
unprecedented warmth mr bush and mr putin have met before and praised each other warmly .
" now us officials say that warmth can replace the frigid diplomatic dance of past decades , and bring dramatic results , " says the bbc 's washington correspondent , tim franks .
as he proposes the us cuts , president bush knows that the cash-strapped russians are keen to dismantle a large number of their own missiles .
mr bush will also ask for , and expect to get , mr putin 's acquiescence for preliminary testing of america 's missile defence shield .
no explicit link will be made with russian requests , but president putin may indicate that he would like movement on debt relief and trade access , our correspondent says .

the big threat for us and for the russians is not each other , but somebody developing weapons of mass destruction president bush president bush told russian journalists there was no need for long discussions and he expected mr putin would produce plans to scale back russia 's nuclear arms .
the us president said he would also argue that the existing anti-ballistic missile treaty was outdated because it prevented the development of defensive weapons systems that reflected real threats .
mr bush praised mr putin , saying they were close to forging a relationship that would outlive their presidencies .
mr putin is on a three-day visit to the us which will include meetings at president bush 's ranch in texas .
unprecedented warmth mr bush and mr putin have met before and praised each other warmly .
" now us officials say that warmth can replace the frigid diplomatic dance of past decades , and bring dramatic results , " says the bbc 's washington correspondent , tim franks .
as he proposes the us cuts , president bush knows that the cash-strapped russians are keen to dismantle a large number of their own missiles .
missile defence is still a major sticking point mr bush will also ask for , and expect to get , mr putin 's acquiescence for preliminary testing of america 's missile defence shield .
no explicit link will be made with russian requests , but president putin may indicate that he would like movement on debt relief and trade access , our correspondent says .

chris columbus , the us director of harry potter and the philosopher 's stone , says he loves uk culture and finds a uk boarding school a fascinating setting for a story .
but harry potter 's adventures at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry were not columbus ' first experience of the old-fashioned boarding school environment .
he came to london during the making of the film young sherlock holmes -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , which he wrote .
" that was sort of a predecessor to this movie , in a sense , " says the pennsylvania-born director .
dream come true " it was about two young boys and a girl in a british boarding school who had to fight a supernatural force . "
but he adds that he would not send his own four children , aged between four and 12 , to boarding school .
" i 'd miss them too much . "
they are , however , going to school in england while the director completes the second harry potter film on which shooting has already begun .
although columbus does not yet know how many harry potter films there will be , he says he would love to make all seven - assuming jk rowling publishes the expected final three books of the series - and he could easily imagine living in london for several more years .
getting the opportunity to direct films in britain was a dream come true , says columbus , admitting to being " a bit of an anglophile " .
" i was obsessed with british cinema from when i started out as a film student .
i always liked the early david lean films and the ealing comedies as well as british humour .
" monty python and all those things were a part of me when i was growing up . "
for a director better known for such american favourites as home alone and mrs doubtfire , getting the uk flavour of harry potter right was crucial .
tips " the britishness of the film was something i was committed to from the beginning , " he says .
the author of the harry potter books , jk rowling had insisted on an all-uk cast and was determined that the film should be a faithful reflection of her creation .
columbus says he was delighted to be able to consult her on the detail of the world she had imagined , getting tips on casting and costumes .
he does admit to being nervous , however , when rowling finally saw the film - he skipped the screening in favour of playing football with his children , and was relieved when he later got a call to say she had loved it .
while working on what promises to be one of the most popular films ever made in britain , columbus immersed himself thoroughly in uk life .
he goes to the theatre in london whenever he can , often reads five uk newspapers in a day and drives a uk car .
" i bought a mini cooper when i got here .
i 'm a big fan of the movie the italian job , so i 've been driving it around the city . "
' dedicated ' he and his family are even going to spend christmas in london this year , instead of returning home to san francisco .
the experience of working with uk children has been a positive one too , the director says .
" british kids are so polite and they are just amazing actors - absolutely dedicated . "
he believes they benefit from having role models such as maggie smith - who plays professor mcgonagall in harry potter - and alan rickman - who plays professor snape - because they are serious actors who constantly switch between theatre , film and television .
" here -lrb- in britain -rrb- , " says columbus , " it 's all about becoming a better actor and maintaining consistency in your craft , as opposed to going from one movie to another and not trying anything different .
i think that gets you kind of stale . "

philip kerton , from broadstairs , kent , said he now believes his daughter has been kidnapped or killed after she failed to get in touch with her sister angela on her birthday a month ago .
louise kerton went missing in germany at the end of july , and although her parents have spent many days searching for her there they have drawn a blank .
mr kerton said : " we are now convinced she has come to harm , the reason being that she failed to make any communication with her sister on her birthday .
i am sure she is incapacitated in some way , or has come to harm by falling from a cliff or something phillip kerton " it is very significant because they were very close , and we were aware that if she was in her right mind , she would have made contact . "
mr kerton , 56 , said kent police told him that german police had raided the family home of his daughter 's fiance , peter simon , in the town of strassfield , near aachen .
he said : " i was informed that police had searched peter 's home and garden with sniffer dogs to eliminate it as a possible crime scene .
" it shows that at long last the german police are starting to take this seriously and not believe everything they have been told without checking it themselves . "
no official sightings miss kerton , a former classmate of lucie blackman , the british woman murdered in japan , was dropped off at aachen railway station by her fiance 's mother ramana simon .
she was then due to travel from aachen to ostend in belgium on 30 july , and on to dover to meet her fiance .
when the 24-year-old failed to arrive a search began involving police from germany , belgium and the uk .
although there have been no official sightings of his daughter since , mr kerton has conducted searches of aachen after a number of reported sightings .
he said : " we are not going back to aachen to look for her unless we have reason to do so .
" i am sure she is incapacitated in some way , or has come to harm by falling from a cliff or something . "

the conversations were recorded on an acetate disc in 1964 - which was bought for just $ 5 -lrb- £ 3.40 -rrb- at a los angeles flea market earlier this year .
the recording takes the form of a simultaneous telephone interview in which the two groups tease , according to dave gioia , a spokesman for the firm auctioning the disc .
the beach boys ' brian wilson jokes with john lennon about the beatles ' famous haircuts and dress sense .
' mutual fans ' the groups also discuss the fab four 's upcoming , untitled film - which became the pop classic a hard day 's night .

" it 's an extraordinary recording in which the beatles and the beach boys poke fun at each other , in the most good-natured way .

select the link below to watch talking point on air : 56k modems a senior pentagon official says the taleban departure from the afghan capital of kabul is " great news " .
taleban forces have abandoned kabul , fleeing south overnight as contingents of northern alliance troops entered the city .
but un secretary general kofi annan says the un must " move quickly " to help set up a representative government in afghanistan .
the pakistani government has made it clear it did not want the northern alliance to take kabul and they wanted it to be a demilitarised zone .
foreign ministry spokesman aziz ahmed khan said : " until the setting up of a multi-ethnic dispensation , no single group should occupy kabul . "
who should govern afghanistan when , and if , the taleban falls ?
should the taleban and the northern alliance play a part in any new administration ?
who should decide ?
this debate has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme the us are now funding the northern alliance .
did n't they fund bin laden a few years ago ?
there was a lesson to learn there , has bush jnr missed it ?
dave , uk i think none of the leaders nor warriors should be elected to govern afghanistan mohammad zaher , indiana , usa i think none of the leaders nor warriors should be elected to govern afghanistan .
i think we should bring in educated persons with diverse ethnic backgrounds .
i say to pakistan 's president musharraf : please leave us alone , please leave the people of afghanistan alone .
who are you to decide the future of our country ?
mohammad zaher , indiana , usa the people of afghanistan should be their own government .
all the different tribes of the country have to sit down and try to establish a working government voted in by the people to help rebuild their country , for the interest of the people .
the outside communities should not be directly involved , for this would be another invasion of their country .
help rebuild and , when the afghanistan government is put in place peacefully , let free press , tvand radio re-enter the country so the people have the choice to live their lives without any oppression .
educated afghanistan people are living outside of their country and , if they can be assured re-entry to help their families and friends , then they might have a chance to .
good education for all men and women is the only way .
asherah , canada i think that if a broad-based government is established , the disputes will become intensified .
different people come from different groups .
some are radical and some are moderate .
this will lead to more quarrels .
just like japan after the second world war - it became very weak .
it was transferred into a democratic country .
although it is still a highly industrialized and rich country , it is very weak because there are too many different ideas from different groups .
therefore afghanistan will remain a weak country .
and many rebellions are coming soon .
jambon the only way to stop the endless war would be partition of afghanistan along ethnic lines alam , usa the fragmentation of afghanistan along ethnic lines has gone too far and bringing different ethnic groups living in the country under one flag seems highly unrealistic .
whether we like it or not , the only way to stop the endless war in afghanistan would be its partition along ethnic lines .
neither zakhir shah nor the united states or any other great power will be able to put together what had already broken apart .
the ethnic divide is way too deep , " thanks " to the taleban regime and its policy of pashtunization .
alam , usa can mr rumsfeld kindly define the " post-taliban " era ?
taliban were a result of dynamic afghan changes .
they will always remain in afghanistan armed to their teeth even if the alliance takes over kabul .
mohammad ali bangash , karachi , pakistan although i agree with the bombing campaign , i do feel it will achieve very little for afghanistan .
even if we do set up a full democratic society , it will be toppled in a few years and fall backwards into civil war and decay .
it takes an intelligent government to rule a democratic country .
the rulers must be fair and not corrupt .
also religion and politics do not mix .
if you look at any successful country , religion plays very little part in the lifestyle of people or government .
the country has to be run by intelligent and educated people and not simply by old outdated religious values .
personally , i think there is very little the west can do for nations like afghanistan .
they have to evolve themselves and not be thrust into a democracy they have never had .
let 's get bin laden , overthrow the taliban and just leave them to squabble it out themselves .
phil matthews , uk the last two decades have left afghanistan fragmented and lawless naveed kamal , karachi , pakistan the last two decades have left afghanistan fragmented and lawless .
we have the taleban on one hand and various factions of the northern alliance on the other .
none of these truly represents the afghan people and their aspirations .
the best way to ensure peace and tranquillity in afghanistan is through focus on its economic and social development .
neither the taleban nor the northern alliance should have any role in a post-taleban government .
naveed kamal , karachi , pakistan i think george w bush should be the new president of afghanistan since he is clearly more interested in meddling with the affairs of foreign countries than sorting out his own domestic problems , then perhaps he would do more for the us than he does at present .
anon , london , uk afghanistan is one of those places that no matter who 's in power , there will be trouble .
maybe a coalition of tribes will be a better type of government but it will have to include the taliban .
no one group can run a country like afghanistan .
russ black , usa i do n't think the people of any country except the afghans themselves have got a right to decide or discuss who should rule afghanistan zia mian , lahore , pakistan give me a break ! ! !
there wo n't be anything left to govern ! !
we bomb the country to bits and pieces and then we expect there will be something there to govern ? ? ?
j. cunningham , usa it seems that the united states is damned if we do help and damned if we do n't chad , seattle , usa it seems that the united states is damned if we do help and damned if we do n't .
if the us sat back and let the taleban murder people for something as normal as wanting to work , then people would want to know how we could let this happen .
do you think it 's right to suppress women as they do just because they are n't physically strong enough to fight back ?
also , can you imagine what terrorism would be like in 10 years if we left afghanistan and the taleban alone ?
i guarantee that our leaders in washington have thought this out long and hard .
chad , seattle , usa i think an american and british military government would work fine .
notice that germany and japan are democratic today .
the occupation in those countries lasted only a few years but worked wonders .
larry hastings , san diego , usa the only afghan future the usa is concerned with is to install a us-friendly government that will give it full rights to laying oil pipeline in the country .
who cares about the people ?
not the usa for a start .
zaheer mahmood , sheffield , uk we need to make afghanistan a model example of what the western world can do when liberating an oppressed people robert morpheal , canada the future of afghanistan rests upon the dethroning of the teleban .
any country that has become militarised and oppressed under an extremist regime requires longer term involvement on the part of its liberators .
it also requires reconstruction , as well as pacification .
we have seen successful examples in the instance of japan and germany post world war ii .
both countries were pacified and assisted in long term rebuilding subsequent to their suffering in the war .
both german fascism and japanese extremism that terrorised pearl harbour were ultimately defeated .
both countries were rebuilt , politically , economically , and ideologically .
we need to see the same intensity of long term effort in afghanistan to make it a model example of what the western world can do when liberating an oppressed people .
it is only in that manner that the war can ultimately be won .
robert morpheal , canada i believe a broad-based government should be formed under the supervision of the united nations .
the afghans should be allowed to elect their leaders democratically .
such a government , when in place , needs to be given the required foreign aids to be able to meet the aspirations of the populace .
onabamiro adebamiro , kaduna , nigeria the irony of it all - president bush and his partner tony blair have nothing against the people of afghanistan .
except , of course to kill them .
and kill them they do without mercy and in droves .
they do not do that to israel or to the ira .
the labour party has always been thought to be people-centrist , but now blair is directly responsible for killing innocent afghans .
would america and its puppet please leave afghanistan alone .
khalid , dar es salaam , tanzania too many other countries ' governments just use afghanistan as a stomping ground for their armies to slog it out and the poor locals get the full blast of all the cross-fire .
it is far too obvious that afghanistan , so severely devastated that its people just simply do not have the strength or ability to stand on their own feet and maintain a stable fair system of management for their ruined country .
selma , england afghanistan is the land of the afghans - let them decide who rules their country mr v patel , london afghanistan is the land of the afghans - let them decide who rules their country .
many comments on this site say that western countries should intervene .
how would britain and america like it if afghanistan said who should govern them ?
mr v patel , london i believe that there is already a legitimate government in afghanistan but if the people there feel that they do need a change , a popular uprising would be okay .
but i do not support the idea of americans going around the world telling the afghans who should or should not be their government .
benjamin , accra , ghana maybe i 'm missing something here but what has the taleban done apart from harbour various terrorists wanted by the us ?
i do n't like their human rights record anymore than anyone else but i do n't agree with this bombing .
alex banks , waterford , ireland -lrb- british -rrb- when afghans are leaving the country in millions and those left behind are dying of starvation what is the point of having a government there ?
run a country inhabited by few hundred people ?
it would be better if afghanistan became part of pakistan for an indefinite period .
at least the aid agencies would be able get to the starving masses .
mahesh srinivasan , manchester , uk i think we are missing the point here .
it matters not one iota who governs afghanistan so long as they are prepared for the yanks to lay an oil pipeline to carry uzbeck oil through their country .
rhys hughes , wales i , for one , am not entirely convinced that the taleban are the enemy .
i think there is conclusive evidence to support the theory of iraqi involvement .
firstly , saddam bears , at least two , grudges particularly against the us and britain .
secondly , i heard on cnn that the head hijacker met twice with a known iraqi intelligence officer .
in short , there is a plethora of evidence to support the theory that iraq was involved .
make your own judgement .
peter bolton , uk in usa the afghan king is the only person who can restore the nation pisut ruttanaporn , usa the afghan king is the only person who can restore the nation .
the election is a solution to find out what afghan people want .
however , it has to be done under the supervision of the united nations .
pisut ruttanaporn , chicago ridge usa let the people decide for themselves and respect their sovereignty .
solvere cog there was no racial and ethnic dispute between the afghan people ¿ until the taliban were brought into afghanistan by the pakistani government to act as their puppets , and one of the ways that the taliban have been successful is through their division of the afghan people ¿ by separating the pashtoons from tajiks and hazaras .
the major problem for any new government would be how to bring everyone under one flag .
mustafa hedayat , australia any solution for a post-war afghanistan , would have to be based on a strong central government , capable of applying , by force if necessary , the dictat of that government .
only a strong central government could run the country .
stuart montgomery singapore your comments during the programme the afghans should decide ... they should be allowed to make their own mistakes geraldyn yap , singapore i think the afghans should decide on the future of their country and the form of government - they should be allowed to make their own mistakes .
the decision should not be affected by what the western powers think and the western powers should not adopt the condescending attitude that they know what is best for the afghan people .
geraldyn yap , singapore it is sad but true , today in afghanistan there are no suitable factions or groups that are capable of ruling a country .
we have seen taliban and northen alliance , and they are just warlords and thugs .
and pakistan would never want a government which will solely in work for benefit of afghans .
i think america and the west have to play a big role in future of afghanistan .
king could be a wise choice .
forough alifi , australia it 's very easy to sit in front of the computer with a hot cup of tea and express our intellectual thoughts .
i am surprised to see that people from different parts of the world are suggesting that afghanistan should be broken and different parts should be distributed among the neighbouring countries as if its a piece of cake !
but do they ever think about the feelings of an afghan person before expressing such comments ?
khaled , uk as an afghan i agree with the people who said " let afghans make the post-taliban government themselves " , but in reality we can not do it alone in this desperate situation .
we need super power countries like us and uk to stay behind us in this mission. ehsan , ipswich , uk extremist fractions within taliban and the whole northern alliance should be excluded latif and ziam , norway the future government should consist of king zahir shah and representatives of all the ethnic groups according to their percentage .
extremist fractions within taliban and the whole northern alliance should be excluded from all future governments in afghanistan .
the neighbouring countries have been involved in the suffering of the afghan nation more than enough .
they are not the ones who should decide what kind of government afghanistan should have in the future .
latif and ziam , norway your comments before we went on air even if the taleban are toppled , that wo n't mean that afghanistan will have a eutopian society .
all the afghan tribesmen -lrb- including the na -rrb- have said that any proxy government that the west tries to install , i.e. the shah , will be will be opposed by force .
more war and bloodshed .
an election will almost certainly produce a relatively religiously hardline government anyway , because that 's what most afghanis are !
ibn masood , uk here you are deciding what should be the future of afghanistan .
that 's ok .
lets make a deal .
you people decide the future of afghanistan and let the people of afghanistan decide the future of your countries ?
how about that ? jasm , peshawar since there appears to be no kind of ethnic cohesion in afghanistan there is no reason to maintain its status as a sovereign state .
why not hand the pashtun areas to pakistan and unite the uzbek and tajik areas with their respective states .
as long as we can maintain sound governments in those countries then we should have no more trouble from the afghans .
pete whitehead , uk a bit late to be thinking about this .
the monarchy should be restored until the whole nation is given the opportunity to decide how to proceed .
in reality , it is nobodys business except the afghans .
john atkins , bridgwater , england the hope that afghanistan can survive as a stable entity is a myth .
a decade of relentless civil war has proven that the different ethnic factions in afghanistan are incapable of a peaceful co-existence under one flag .
in such a case , the best scenario would be to dissolve the durand line , amalgamate the pashtun areas with pakistan , and cede the rest to those central asian republics bordering afghanistan , and having large ethnic minorities there .
faisal aziz , islamabad , pakistan how about a un appointed government , selecting educated afghanis either living in afghanistan or ex-patriots who fled the country during the oppression to stand for election ?
hyder , las vegas , usa who are we to decide upon the rulers of afghanistan ?
in the case of taleban , i think without large-scale grassroot support they could n't have managed to control 95 % of afghanistan .
it seems rather farcical to me that the west should flatten the country with bombs , and then expect everything to be hunky dory .
fahim , london , uk the hope of building a broad-based government in afghanistan is unrealistic mushtaq , london , uk the hope of building a broad-based government in afghanistan is unrealistic .
the ethnic divisions in the country are too deep .
afghanistan has never been a stable and unified country except for short periods .
if the taleban fall , the only realistic solution will be to divide the country along ethnic lines .
this division may result in some transfer of population , but that will be preferable to endless bloodshed which an attempt to maintain a united afghanistan will cause .
mushtaq , london , uk let the afghan people decide .
does pakistan have broad-based government ?
they really have double standards .
when it suits them they implant dictators and when circumstances change , they say the rules of game have changed .
they are really bad players and bad umpires to be shunned and banned .
muhammad arshad , lahore , pakistan leave us afghans alone and we will do best nawar , luton as an afghan i am fed up to listen to other talking about who should be included in our future government .
leave us afghans alone and we will do best .
nawar , luton the un has to play a vital role in the creation of a broad-based care-taker government for afghanistan .
any attempt to impose a self-styled government based only on the majority of one section of the society will definitely lead to another dictatorial style government without any respect for the human rights .
the un can start to think in considering the former king zahir shah who commands respect and leadership of a large majority of afghans , irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds .
mahesh chandra somani , oulu , finland i think the northern alliance could be an alternative .
at least they are backed by countries like india and newly democratic power russia and iran rather than a bunch of " moderates " propped up by pakistanis .
experience has shown there are no moderate taliban .
patrick , usa the russians tried -lrb- for years -rrb- and failed to install a puppet government in afghanistan ben taylor , eston , england the russians tried -lrb- for years -rrb- and failed to install a puppet government in afghanistan , using all it 's military might .
do the us and british politicians really believe that a country and people that have lived with war for the past 25 years will just roll over and surrender after a few weeks of air raids ?
to oust the taleban and bring about real peace and democracy would require a massive military campaign with many thousands of troops on the ground .
western governments will shy away from this because of the possibility of ' body bags ' and perhaps quite a lot of them returning and lowering their popularity .
ben taylor , eston , england after reading some of the comments posted here , i am saddened to see that there are so many people who believe that the west and or the un has a right to determine the fate of the afghan people .
has n't the west already done enough ?
the rise of fundamentalism in afghanistan was supported by the us to combat the soviet presence there .
the billions of dollars that the us spent to fuel the war there , left millions of innocent afghans dead and a country torn to shreds .
if the super powers did not exploit the afghans for their own selfish reasons , the war in afghanistan probably would have ended a lot sooner and with less destruction .
south asia has always fought imperialism .
it is time that imperialism ends .
let the people of afghanistan and people of other developing countries start determining their own fate .
even if the government is despotic or tyrannical , it should be up to the people of those countries to fight for their own self-determination .
faisal , seattle , washington the question you pose is really the crux of the problem in afghanistan .
it seems that every one except the afghanis are involved in forming a government for afghanistan .
history should have taught us that afghanistan 's problems lie in the very fact that external forces have meddled in its affairs ostensibly for the good of the afghani people -lrb- or they justified it like that -rrb- and all they ended up doing was piling on more misery on the afghani people .
it seems we have not taken our lesson from history .
asif hadi , sydney , australia many of the comments show typical western arrogance , ignorance and cultural imperialism abdul kareem , karachi , pakistan many of the comments show typical western arrogance , ignorance , cultural imperialism and the belief that every one wishes to live like them .
afghani 's should be allowed to vote for their leaders in free and fair elections with universal suffrage which everyone including taleban should take part in - however as in the rest of the muslim world i doubt the us will support democracy - as it may mean the installation of a regime that refuses to do its bidding - so instead it will probably try -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to impose a stooge on afghanistan .
afghanistan is a muslim country - the attempts by the latter-day crusaders to make it otherwise would n't succeed abdul kareem , karachi , pakistan it is possible for a society to move from feudalism to socialism and still make tremendous progress .
a cuban model with a doze of islam is my recommendation .
since frugality is a virtue to the taleban one need not worry too much about corruption .
it would be much more desirable than a capitalist system which may enrich a few but will leave the majority in abject poverty .
with collapse of the soviet union the americans may not be too paranoid about such a state .
farouk dindar , canada interesting that not one of the above commentators here who support the taleban as the lesser of many evils is an afghani woman .
lisa , honolulu , usa i am not willing to tolerate those who are committed to " murdering " to further their own ambitions to gain power bill , mertztown , usa as long as there are people whose politics are concerned more with power than leadership , and who thrive on telling others how they ought to live , we will continue cycles of war and terror .
having said this , i also am not willing to tolerate those who are committed to " murdering " to further their own ambitions to gain power .
bill , mertztown , usa just look at history and you 'll know what will happen with the future govt. of afghanistan .
once again the u.s. and britain will hand-pick a puppet to head the country .
likely he will become king rather than be voted in democratically by the people .
this so the west can continue to control who replaces each successive king decade after decade , and as is done now in many other countries .
however , do n't rule out that the u.s. will have a strong military presence in this new kingdom . again just like in other mid-east countries .
this will set the west up nicely to monitor pakistan and other neighboring muslim countries ... and do n't forget china too !
and at who 's expense ?
just the poor afghan people who the u.s. government could care less about ... just like in iraq .
carolyn , usa as someone who remembers how exotic and mystical afghanistan used to be , today 's afghanistan shows what happens to people when civil wars rage and the rest of the world abandons them .
afghanistan is the world 's " dirty little secret " that has just come out of the closet .
the taleban must be obliterated since they are not representatives of the afghan people .
they are the creation of a foreign power seeking to annex sovereign lands through a proxy government .
certainly , the u.n. should play a role in the future of afghanistan , but the afghanis themselves must be allowed to choose their government .
whether it is a democracy , theocracy , or regency . leave that up to the ordinary afghanis .
the regional and world super-powers have a duty to pay for the reconstruction of afghanistan and to ensure all afghanis are allowed basic human rights and freedoms .
rita caywood , houston , texas i am not sure what the future of afghanistan will be or who should govern it .
quite frankly this discussion is purely academic .
for every solution we or the un come up with there will be a dozen countries to undermine it and point their fingers elsewhere .
i am certain however , that as long as the taleban are in power , al-qaeda will exist .
as long as al-qaeda exists the future is very bleak for all of us .
it is inconceivable that the taleban apologists should expect us to live with a gun to our head .
in my view it is an " us or them " situation .
if the pakistanis and afghans can not understand this , then let 's get down to settling it for good .
munro , canada the afghani congress of 1000 heads of cities / villages is meeting in pakistan presently and they represent all afghanis .
they have stated that the usa / britain planes must stop the bombing of their " $ 10 tents by $ 1,000,000 bombs " .
these are the leaders who should be respected .
the citizens of usa / britain can not afford this type of war .
will someone please use some intelligent thought and not an absurd , " white man 's burden " , logic .
charles digal , usa a new afghan government will only work if it rejects terrorism scott myatt , texas the people of afghanistan must be freed from the grip of mad-dog terrorists and self-serving despotic mullas .
clerics need to turn away from the secular power they have used to murder in the name of god .
it is evil to promote suicide and violence as honorable .
a new afghan government will only work if it reject terrorism and embrace humanitarianism as the will of god .
scott myatt , new braunfels , texas if this conflict ever ends successfully for the west and a government is imposed on afghanistan by the west then we will either see a replay of what is happening at the moment .
previous imposed leaders have been murdered , mutilated and displayed in public areas whilst a government of afghan people then take power .
or , we will see the same problem as that between israel and palestine right now .
if we wish to see an end to this problem then we should stop meddling in other countries affairs .
it will only breed more contempt and in another 50 years the whole sorry saga will start all over again .
we are currently reaping the errors of our previous politicians - the covert underhanded and undemocratic choices they have made in the past are now coming to forefront .
we certainly did n't ask for this , but the way our nations have acted in the past certainly did .
anon , only the citizens -lrb- including women -rrb- of afghanistan can decide who they want .
they can vote and choose the leaders from each tribe -lrb- pashtuns , tajiks , ujbeks , hazaras and other small groups -rrb- .
the afghani people did not choose the taliban government .
they took over .
but us , russia , and uk should definitely help rebuild the country they destroyed and continue to destroy .
they owe it to the afghani people .
ratna sengupta , usa i am unsure as to whether the british public realise that afghanistan was in a far worse state of affairs before the taliban took power .
however , that is comparing the worst with the second worse senario .
i would not like the northern alliance having any powers of government in the country because they are entirely unstable .
i wish the russians had taken it instead !
ronan quinn , dublin , ireland if you install a puppet , then you have to guard him sukanta , usa no puppet can be forced on afghans .
if you install a puppet , then you have to guard him , as many will be vying for his blood .
maybe afghanistan should be divided on ethnic line .
the un should fix boundaries between ethnic divisions .
an election should be held in each division .
basically , each ethnic division should have a self-rule .
there should be separation of divisional armed forces and political rulers .
people who are now fighting - including the northern alliance - should be disarmed .
peace at division borders should be monitored by un observers and the cost should be provided by cold war powers who have played at afghan bloods .
a un peace keeping army should be stationed at the afghan-pakistan border .
then the rulers of ethnic divisions should form a federation to promote cultural integrity to start with .
sukanta , tampa , usa a post-taleban government should be as representative as possible .
helle lykke jacobsen , denmark in order to avoid further strife , a post-taleban government should be as representative as possible .
the united nations should play a key role to facilitate such a government .
a possible solution with greater chances of success could be modelled after the swiss cantonal system with a kind of home-rule for local regions and a central government with rotating participation of the different ethnic parties / factions .
a new marshall - or rather powell-plan should help rebuild the country .
aid should be subject to strict conditions that human rights will be observed , especially those of women .
sharia law is inhuman and not acceptable -lrb- something mary robinson ought to have an opinion about -rrb- .
helle lykke jacobsen , copenhagen , denmark it 's wrong to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations - in this case , to impose a government .
however , the alternative in this case - of not doing so - is worse .
if the choice is between imposing what suits us and being terrorized by the festering , murderous alternative , then frankly i pick the former and i do n't care about principles .
a un-based body of external origin should be installed .
diedrich kohl , vancouver , canada " not untill the population are suffering are you sure that they are entirely submissive " - george orwell , ' 1984 ' .
this has never been more true than with the people of afganistan .
it angers me to read the comments of people supporting the ' political and social triumphs ' of the taleban .
make no mistake , this is despotism - the only thing that will save the afghani people is freedom ; freedom to choose , freedom to learn , freedom to vote , freedom to think - this will never be allowed within the confines of a taleban regime and is indeed what we are -lrb- in essence -rrb- fighting for .
removal of the taliban is not only desirable , it is neccessary to ensure the stability of the region .
the un has the funds and expertise to reform afghanistans social and economic structure , and this should be done for the good of the afghanistan people and no other reason pr , uk why not partition the country on tribal lines ?
paul t horgan , bracknell , england given that there may be a tribal context to the bitter rivalry between the northern alliance and the taleban why not partition the country on tribal lines with the tajiks in the north and the pashtuns in the south .
the south would have affinity with pakistan and fulfil their ambition to have a client state and the north would be an adjunct to tajikistan .
the benefit is that neither northern or southern afghanistan would be a client state of terrorists .
paul t horgan , bracknell , england the united nations , without a doubt .
there is no one group within afghanistan even remotely qualifed to run the country .
a un administration would obviously include afghans , but the leadership should be people not of the region ... deomcracy should be in place for the local / regional positions , but not the central administration until such time as suitable candidates have been matured .
we do n't want ot replace the current regime with another that is equally corrupt , unsecular or inept .
mark m. newdick , us / uk one wonders if the memory of some of our leaders is good john f , australia the west is again interfering in setting , or trying to put their own puppet at the head of a country .
the lesson has not been learned !
one wonders if the memory of some of our leaders is good - or maybe they think they learned the lesson and " are sure that they have now the right recipe " ..
it is the same on the battlefield !
do the " advisors " to our leaders have new fresh ideas ... such as trying a more human approach by putting people before economics for once ! ?
think human !
you will amazed to see that " they " are also human !
stop demonizing as you become like them too !
thank you for your attention , and may love , peace and understanding be our lot in the " new world " .
john f. , australia it is vital that the post-taleban regime bring stability to a country wrecked by 20 years of war , and establish the conditions for prosperity .
accordingly , afghanistan should be invited to become the 51st state of the usa .
shaun , london , uk the un and the west should assist in the formation of an interim government for at least two years .
the un model of east timor is a good example .
during this time , the infrastructure of the country should be rebuilt at least to a basic level .
this should then pave the way for a free and fair election .
those who put the united front -lrb- northern alliance -rrb- on par with the terrorists and the taleban are lacking in detailed knowlege of afghan history .
the united front is a legitimate representative of the majority of the afghan population .
this will be proven once free and fair elctions are held .
khalil nasri , australia the western world should be careful , in not being seen , to be imposing upon the afghan people , a government which has no popular support .
while it is true that the taleban have imposed some draconian measures , it is still by far the most popular of the factions in afghanistan .
one must not forget that prior to the taleban , the other factions were not able to govern afghanistan and there was a complete breakdown in the law and order .
therefore , if the taleban falls , an interim government should be formed involving all the disparate ethnic groups including the moderate taleban , under the auspices of the united nations .
muslim countries should , under the un , provide members for a security / peace force for maintaining law and order .
to succeed any future plans would have to be based on , the sharia and the local jirga concept .
arif sayed , dubai , uae the taleban are the real government of afghanistan syed salman jalal kakakhel , peshawar , pakistan the taleban are the real government of afghanistan .
everyone is wondering who will form that government in the future .
i do n't know why they are neglecting the taleban , who are in control of 90 % of afghanistan .
the us and the west in general are opposing the taleban purely for their own benefit , not for that of the afghan people .
syed salman jalal kakakhel , peshawar , pakistan afghanistan 's future is unlikely to be any different from either its past or its present .
regardless of what happens in this present war , it will remain a veritable pawn used cynically by one opportunistic group or another to serve its partisan purposes .
sriraman annaswamy , sydney , australia / madras , india in response to lori 's comments .
why does the west always think of imposing its social mores on others ?
it is for afghans to decide what type of government they will have .
before imposing its government on afghanistan , the west should ask itself how it would feel if afghanistan was a powerful country and bombed america to remove what it thought was an oppressive regime .
kg , india what afghanistan needs is a legitimate government .
unfortunately , even the perceived legitimacy of the democratic -lrb- but extremely corrupt -rrb- governments of russia and india has been called into question .
the taleban have shown , whether we like it or not , that the only government that can maintain legitimacy in afghanistan , and thus reduce drug cultivation and enforce disarmament , is an islamic state , in name and practice .
henry , ann arbor , usa neither the taleban nor the northern alliance are capable of handling their own country .
it 's time for the americans and the british to take full control of afghan affairs .
mohammed imtiaz , hong kong the unseating of the taleban from power would just represent a new phase in the civil conflict in afghanistan bailo b jallow , london , uk the imminent unseating of the taleban from power would just represent a new phase in the civil conflict in afghanistan and not an end to it .
afghans of all ethnic backgrounds would only be able to peacefully co-exist together when countries like pakistan , india , russia , and of course the usa do not seek to impose their own regimes on the afghan people .
bailo b jallow , london , uk american bombers seem to be bombing dust .
or at best , rubble into dust .
what is this campaign achieving anyway ?
of the billions that america spent in afghanistan during the cold war , not a shard of that was spent on anything constructive .
all of it was for weapons for american ideals .
america seems to be adding to the total number of world casualties in the wake of the wtc attacks .
the taleban and the northern alliance are both guilty of pathetic and barbarous human rights offences .
now they want zahir shah to take over .
how sad for the afghan people that someone like him is their only hope , albeit better than the taleban .
this is indeed a sad war .
razal , vienna , usa who will rule afghanistan ?
whoever allows america to build an oil pipeline across the country , i would have thought .
chris , uk looking at the present situation , the whole social infrastructure of the country has been destroyed by the fighting that has been going on for years .
the only chance of afghans reconstructing their homeland is if american interference stops for good .
syed najaf afghan , islamabad , pakistan this is an opportunity for real statesmanship ian , auckland , new zealand historically , the western world has had some successes and failures in this type of venture .
japan , after being run by militaristic hardliners and being ravaged by wwii , was successfully transformed into a modern vibrant democracy .
this should serve as a model .
the events in new york have demonstrated that the first world can not leave the third world to fester with impunity .
this is an opportunity for real statesmanship .
ian , auckland , new zealand once a totalitarian oppressive regime is toppled , self-governance amongst its people depends largely on their level of education and on how liberal that education has been .
in a country such as afghanistan , there is a problem .
it is a country where ignorance is the instilled condition and where many have been taught to believe that one religious scripture , that originates 1400 and more years ago , is the sole and sufficient basis for all scientific , political , economic and social knowledge sufficient and necessary to all social needs .
that only worsens the problem of self-governance .
it is nearly impossible .
britain did a good job in bringing education to its colonies , and in fact that example might well be appropriate to afghanistan .
the united nations might be granted governance until education is more liberal and universal in afghanistan so that a true and effective democratic and constitutional system can be effected .
afghanistan as a un protectorate is not unthinkable , but with an international military presence to enforce the peace until it is ready to rule and protect itself .
afghanistan is merely a child to the western world and it must be understood as such .
what the western world does with the upbringing of that child will be on its conscience and is its responsibility .
robert morpheal , canada i believe that the us has been wronged and that it deserves revenge against the people that have committed this horrifying act .
but i also think that afghan civilians should n't be punished for the evil acts of others .
paige munroe , vancouver , canada the question of " what future for afghanistan after the taleban " is a typical western query and is itself the root cause of terrorism in the first place .
what business of ours is the future of afghanistan ?
apart from self interest and warmongering ?
what if the muslim world were debating whether or not to invade the usa in order to restore democracy after the corruption resulting in bush stealing the presidency for the big money power brokers ?
what if they decided to bomb london to teach britain a lesson for oppressing the irish ?
people do n't embark on suicide missions without good cause so why do n't we use this moment in history to find out what is driving people to such desperate behaviour .
by bombing afghanistan to rubble in a futile bid for revenge , america is worsening the rift between the west and the rest of the world and we 're all going to suffer for generations to come .
america should get its nose out of other people 's affairs for a change and stop trying to rearrange the world under its own image .
us citizens might believe all that nonsense about the " land of the free " but i do n't think what 's left of the native american tribes are taken in by that .
wake up america - leave the world alone , you 're causing nothing but trouble .
erik thomas , grimsby , england this mess will take decades to unravel charles moore , edinburgh , scotland the assumption being made is that this conflict will end with a pacified afghanistan ready for a civil society to be rebuilt .
fat chance !
there will be a rump of taleban left fighting a withering guerrilla war , the various factions in the northern alliance will be fighting each other and the regional powers of pakistan , india , iran , russia , turkey and others , will return to supporting their favoured factions .
this mess will take decades to unravel .
charles moore , edinburgh , scotland the question of who should govern a post-taleban afghanistan is absolutely none of our business .
we are attacking the taleban because they have refused to hand over osama bin laden .
if the present regime collapses as a result , it is up to the afghan people to decide who should replace the taleban .
it is most certainly not the responsibility of the usa or the uk to make that decision for them .
to bomb the hell out of an unfortunate country is one thing - to then dictate how it 's going to be governed is adding arrogant insult to massive injury .
let 's just do what has to be done as quickly and painlessly as possible , and allow these poor people the luxury and novelty of deciding their own future .
c bingham-hunter , bedford , england the idea of c. bingham-hunter that we " do what has to be done as quickly and painlessly as possible , and allow these poor people the luxury and novelty of deciding their own future " makes me wonder if he has any idea of the state of afghanistan prior to the current action , never mind if the taleban crumble .
surely the luxury and novelty of having an infrastructure and enough to eat would be a good start ?
it is horrendous and short sighted to suggest in the name of afghani autonomy that the west bomb them out of even the repulsive government they have now , and then just say " there you go , over to you - we have no right to assist you in your recovery " .
alison lowe , london , uk may i please say to alison lowe that i agree entirely with most of her expressed sentiments .
my original point - now in carefully simplified form - was that it seems outrageous to attack a derelict country like afghanistan , possibly oust the extant government , and then assume the right to insert an administration which meets our specifications .
having lived for many years in third world countries , and as a speaker of arabic , i am possibly more aware than ms lowe of the crippling predicament and hardships long endured by those unfortunate people .
and , if we are not very careful , our lasting legacy to them will be a situation somewhat worse than it was before we arrived .
c.bingham-hunter , uk c. bingham-hunter , bedford , england it 's going to take centuries for the country to become safe tim , london the job of policing afghanistan is too big for the us , the un or anyone for that matter .
the only way is to form a loose coalition government with representatives from all corners and try to guide the country through the long process of reform .
but it 's going to take centuries for the country to become safe , if ever .
tim , london , uk the million dollar question is ' will the taleban fall ? '
this has to be kept in mind , as three weeks of successive bombing has not affected them on a large scale .
there has been no defection of taleban troops seen so far and the taleban are still there .
mazar-e-sharif is still in the taleban 's control despite huge claims of it being captured in a few days time .
anyway if it does happen , there is no way out except to make a government comprising the taleban and the northern alliance , plus any other reasonable minority in afghanistan .
you have to keep in mind that people within the northern alliance have already shared power in the previous government , but failed to control certain areas where they were ruling .
i believe there looks to be no certain future for afghan people in the days ahead .
leave the afghan people to have their own choice , interrupt where necessary .
if they are happy with taleban , give them a go .
aqeel akram , mississauga , canada it would certainly be nice to think afghanistan could move to democracy but the history of trying to move countries to democracy before they are ready for it -lrb- e.g. during de-colonisation in africa -rrb- is n't exactly encouraging .
a more realistic route might be through a constitutional monarchy .
malcolm mcmahon , york , uk once the us-led nato alliance has obtained its measure of vengeance for the september 11 terrorist attacks and terminated the rule of the taleban , along with osama bin laden , there will be a vacuum to fill in terms of who will form the next government of afghanistan .
on one hand there is the northern alliance , described by some experts as an opportunistic group of unsavoury characters , and on the other hand , an aging former king living in exile in italy .
there are several possible exit strategies to this " war on terrorism " that one could imagine , but once the story is off the front pages , will the charitable good samaritan option prevail ?
given the present status of the global economy , would these same countries , including britain , willingly help rebuild this ravaged , war-torn country by underwriting its rebirth for the next decade or two ?
or will they , after assuaging their own populace , allow the afghans to sink back into their old impoverished lifestyle ?

select the link below to watch talking point on air : 56k modems a senior pentagon official says the taleban departure from the afghan capital of kabul is " great news " .
taleban forces have abandoned kabul , fleeing south overnight as contingents of northern alliance troops entered the city .
but un secretary general kofi annan says the un must " move quickly " to help set up a representative government in afghanistan .
the pakistani government has made it clear it did not want the northern alliance to take kabul and they wanted it to be a demilitarised zone .
foreign ministry spokesman aziz ahmed khan said : " until the setting up of a multi-ethnic dispensation , no single group should occupy kabul . "
who should govern afghanistan when , and if , the taleban falls ?
should the taleban and the northern alliance play a part in any new administration ?
who should decide ?
this debate has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme the us are now funding the northern alliance .
did n't they fund bin laden a few years ago ?
there was a lesson to learn there , has bush jnr missed it ?
dave , uk i think none of the leaders nor warriors should be elected to govern afghanistan mohammad zaher , indiana , usa i think none of the leaders nor warriors should be elected to govern afghanistan .
i think we should bring in educated persons with diverse ethnic backgrounds .
i say to pakistan 's president musharraf : please leave us alone , please leave the people of afghanistan alone .
who are you to decide the future of our country ?
mohammad zaher , indiana , usa the people of afghanistan should be their own government .
all the different tribes of the country have to sit down and try to establish a working government voted in by the people to help rebuild their country , for the interest of the people .
the outside communities should not be directly involved , for this would be another invasion of their country .
help rebuild and , when the afghanistan government is put in place peacefully , let free press , tvand radio re-enter the country so the people have the choice to live their lives without any oppression .
educated afghanistan people are living outside of their country and , if they can be assured re-entry to help their families and friends , then they might have a chance to .
good education for all men and women is the only way .
asherah , canada i think that if a broad-based government is established , the disputes will become intensified .
different people come from different groups .
some are radical and some are moderate .
this will lead to more quarrels .
just like japan after the second world war - it became very weak .
it was transferred into a democratic country .
although it is still a highly industrialized and rich country , it is very weak because there are too many different ideas from different groups .
therefore afghanistan will remain a weak country .
and many rebellions are coming soon .
jambon the only way to stop the endless war would be partition of afghanistan along ethnic lines alam , usa the fragmentation of afghanistan along ethnic lines has gone too far and bringing different ethnic groups living in the country under one flag seems highly unrealistic .
whether we like it or not , the only way to stop the endless war in afghanistan would be its partition along ethnic lines .
neither zakhir shah nor the united states or any other great power will be able to put together what had already broken apart .
the ethnic divide is way too deep , " thanks " to the taleban regime and its policy of pashtunization .
alam , usa can mr rumsfeld kindly define the " post-taliban " era ?
taliban were a result of dynamic afghan changes .
they will always remain in afghanistan armed to their teeth even if the alliance takes over kabul .
mohammad ali bangash , karachi , pakistan although i agree with the bombing campaign , i do feel it will achieve very little for afghanistan .
even if we do set up a full democratic society , it will be toppled in a few years and fall backwards into civil war and decay .
it takes an intelligent government to rule a democratic country .
the rulers must be fair and not corrupt .
also religion and politics do not mix .
if you look at any successful country , religion plays very little part in the lifestyle of people or government .
the country has to be run by intelligent and educated people and not simply by old outdated religious values .
personally , i think there is very little the west can do for nations like afghanistan .
they have to evolve themselves and not be thrust into a democracy they have never had .
let 's get bin laden , overthrow the taliban and just leave them to squabble it out themselves .
phil matthews , uk the last two decades have left afghanistan fragmented and lawless naveed kamal , karachi , pakistan the last two decades have left afghanistan fragmented and lawless .
we have the taleban on one hand and various factions of the northern alliance on the other .
none of these truly represents the afghan people and their aspirations .
the best way to ensure peace and tranquillity in afghanistan is through focus on its economic and social development .
neither the taleban nor the northern alliance should have any role in a post-taleban government .
naveed kamal , karachi , pakistan i think george w bush should be the new president of afghanistan since he is clearly more interested in meddling with the affairs of foreign countries than sorting out his own domestic problems , then perhaps he would do more for the us than he does at present .
anon , london , uk afghanistan is one of those places that no matter who 's in power , there will be trouble .
maybe a coalition of tribes will be a better type of government but it will have to include the taliban .
no one group can run a country like afghanistan .
russ black , usa i do n't think the people of any country except the afghans themselves have got a right to decide or discuss who should rule afghanistan zia mian , lahore , pakistan give me a break ! ! !
there wo n't be anything left to govern ! !
we bomb the country to bits and pieces and then we expect there will be something there to govern ? ? ?
j. cunningham , usa it seems that the united states is damned if we do help and damned if we do n't chad , seattle , usa it seems that the united states is damned if we do help and damned if we do n't .
if the us sat back and let the taleban murder people for something as normal as wanting to work , then people would want to know how we could let this happen .
do you think it 's right to suppress women as they do just because they are n't physically strong enough to fight back ?
also , can you imagine what terrorism would be like in 10 years if we left afghanistan and the taleban alone ?
i guarantee that our leaders in washington have thought this out long and hard .
chad , seattle , usa i think an american and british military government would work fine .
notice that germany and japan are democratic today .
the occupation in those countries lasted only a few years but worked wonders .
larry hastings , san diego , usa the only afghan future the usa is concerned with is to install a us-friendly government that will give it full rights to laying oil pipeline in the country .
who cares about the people ?
not the usa for a start .
zaheer mahmood , sheffield , uk we need to make afghanistan a model example of what the western world can do when liberating an oppressed people robert morpheal , canada the future of afghanistan rests upon the dethroning of the teleban .
any country that has become militarised and oppressed under an extremist regime requires longer term involvement on the part of its liberators .
it also requires reconstruction , as well as pacification .
we have seen successful examples in the instance of japan and germany post world war ii .
both countries were pacified and assisted in long term rebuilding subsequent to their suffering in the war .
both german fascism and japanese extremism that terrorised pearl harbour were ultimately defeated .
both countries were rebuilt , politically , economically , and ideologically .
we need to see the same intensity of long term effort in afghanistan to make it a model example of what the western world can do when liberating an oppressed people .
it is only in that manner that the war can ultimately be won .
robert morpheal , canada i believe a broad-based government should be formed under the supervision of the united nations .
the afghans should be allowed to elect their leaders democratically .
such a government , when in place , needs to be given the required foreign aids to be able to meet the aspirations of the populace .
onabamiro adebamiro , kaduna , nigeria the irony of it all - president bush and his partner tony blair have nothing against the people of afghanistan .
except , of course to kill them .
and kill them they do without mercy and in droves .
they do not do that to israel or to the ira .
the labour party has always been thought to be people-centrist , but now blair is directly responsible for killing innocent afghans .
would america and its puppet please leave afghanistan alone .
khalid , dar es salaam , tanzania too many other countries ' governments just use afghanistan as a stomping ground for their armies to slog it out and the poor locals get the full blast of all the cross-fire .
it is far too obvious that afghanistan , so severely devastated that its people just simply do not have the strength or ability to stand on their own feet and maintain a stable fair system of management for their ruined country .
selma , england afghanistan is the land of the afghans - let them decide who rules their country mr v patel , london afghanistan is the land of the afghans - let them decide who rules their country .
many comments on this site say that western countries should intervene .
how would britain and america like it if afghanistan said who should govern them ?
mr v patel , london i believe that there is already a legitimate government in afghanistan but if the people there feel that they do need a change , a popular uprising would be okay .
but i do not support the idea of americans going around the world telling the afghans who should or should not be their government .
benjamin , accra , ghana maybe i 'm missing something here but what has the taleban done apart from harbour various terrorists wanted by the us ?
i do n't like their human rights record anymore than anyone else but i do n't agree with this bombing .
alex banks , waterford , ireland -lrb- british -rrb- when afghans are leaving the country in millions and those left behind are dying of starvation what is the point of having a government there ?
run a country inhabited by few hundred people ?
it would be better if afghanistan became part of pakistan for an indefinite period .
at least the aid agencies would be able get to the starving masses .
mahesh srinivasan , manchester , uk i think we are missing the point here .
it matters not one iota who governs afghanistan so long as they are prepared for the yanks to lay an oil pipeline to carry uzbeck oil through their country .
rhys hughes , wales i , for one , am not entirely convinced that the taleban are the enemy .
i think there is conclusive evidence to support the theory of iraqi involvement .
firstly , saddam bears , at least two , grudges particularly against the us and britain .
secondly , i heard on cnn that the head hijacker met twice with a known iraqi intelligence officer .
in short , there is a plethora of evidence to support the theory that iraq was involved .
make your own judgement .
peter bolton , uk in usa the afghan king is the only person who can restore the nation pisut ruttanaporn , usa the afghan king is the only person who can restore the nation .
the election is a solution to find out what afghan people want .
however , it has to be done under the supervision of the united nations .
pisut ruttanaporn , chicago ridge usa let the people decide for themselves and respect their sovereignty .
solvere cog there was no racial and ethnic dispute between the afghan people ¿ until the taliban were brought into afghanistan by the pakistani government to act as their puppets , and one of the ways that the taliban have been successful is through their division of the afghan people ¿ by separating the pashtoons from tajiks and hazaras .
the major problem for any new government would be how to bring everyone under one flag .
mustafa hedayat , australia any solution for a post-war afghanistan , would have to be based on a strong central government , capable of applying , by force if necessary , the dictat of that government .
only a strong central government could run the country .
stuart montgomery singapore your comments during the programme the afghans should decide ... they should be allowed to make their own mistakes geraldyn yap , singapore i think the afghans should decide on the future of their country and the form of government - they should be allowed to make their own mistakes .
the decision should not be affected by what the western powers think and the western powers should not adopt the condescending attitude that they know what is best for the afghan people .
geraldyn yap , singapore it is sad but true , today in afghanistan there are no suitable factions or groups that are capable of ruling a country .
we have seen taliban and northen alliance , and they are just warlords and thugs .
and pakistan would never want a government which will solely in work for benefit of afghans .
i think america and the west have to play a big role in future of afghanistan .
king could be a wise choice .
forough alifi , australia it 's very easy to sit in front of the computer with a hot cup of tea and express our intellectual thoughts .
i am surprised to see that people from different parts of the world are suggesting that afghanistan should be broken and different parts should be distributed among the neighbouring countries as if its a piece of cake !
but do they ever think about the feelings of an afghan person before expressing such comments ?
khaled , uk as an afghan i agree with the people who said " let afghans make the post-taliban government themselves " , but in reality we can not do it alone in this desperate situation .
we need super power countries like us and uk to stay behind us in this mission. ehsan , ipswich , uk extremist fractions within taliban and the whole northern alliance should be excluded latif and ziam , norway the future government should consist of king zahir shah and representatives of all the ethnic groups according to their percentage .
extremist fractions within taliban and the whole northern alliance should be excluded from all future governments in afghanistan .
the neighbouring countries have been involved in the suffering of the afghan nation more than enough .
they are not the ones who should decide what kind of government afghanistan should have in the future .
latif and ziam , norway your comments before we went on air even if the taleban are toppled , that wo n't mean that afghanistan will have a eutopian society .
all the afghan tribesmen -lrb- including the na -rrb- have said that any proxy government that the west tries to install , i.e. the shah , will be will be opposed by force .
more war and bloodshed .
an election will almost certainly produce a relatively religiously hardline government anyway , because that 's what most afghanis are !
ibn masood , uk here you are deciding what should be the future of afghanistan .
that 's ok .
lets make a deal .
you people decide the future of afghanistan and let the people of afghanistan decide the future of your countries ?
how about that ? jasm , peshawar since there appears to be no kind of ethnic cohesion in afghanistan there is no reason to maintain its status as a sovereign state .
why not hand the pashtun areas to pakistan and unite the uzbek and tajik areas with their respective states .
as long as we can maintain sound governments in those countries then we should have no more trouble from the afghans .
pete whitehead , uk a bit late to be thinking about this .
the monarchy should be restored until the whole nation is given the opportunity to decide how to proceed .
in reality , it is nobodys business except the afghans .
john atkins , bridgwater , england the hope that afghanistan can survive as a stable entity is a myth .
a decade of relentless civil war has proven that the different ethnic factions in afghanistan are incapable of a peaceful co-existence under one flag .
in such a case , the best scenario would be to dissolve the durand line , amalgamate the pashtun areas with pakistan , and cede the rest to those central asian republics bordering afghanistan , and having large ethnic minorities there .
faisal aziz , islamabad , pakistan how about a un appointed government , selecting educated afghanis either living in afghanistan or ex-patriots who fled the country during the oppression to stand for election ?
hyder , las vegas , usa who are we to decide upon the rulers of afghanistan ?
in the case of taleban , i think without large-scale grassroot support they could n't have managed to control 95 % of afghanistan .
it seems rather farcical to me that the west should flatten the country with bombs , and then expect everything to be hunky dory .
fahim , london , uk the hope of building a broad-based government in afghanistan is unrealistic mushtaq , london , uk the hope of building a broad-based government in afghanistan is unrealistic .
the ethnic divisions in the country are too deep .
afghanistan has never been a stable and unified country except for short periods .
if the taleban fall , the only realistic solution will be to divide the country along ethnic lines .
this division may result in some transfer of population , but that will be preferable to endless bloodshed which an attempt to maintain a united afghanistan will cause .
mushtaq , london , uk let the afghan people decide .
does pakistan have broad-based government ?
they really have double standards .
when it suits them they implant dictators and when circumstances change , they say the rules of game have changed .
they are really bad players and bad umpires to be shunned and banned .
muhammad arshad , lahore , pakistan leave us afghans alone and we will do best nawar , luton as an afghan i am fed up to listen to other talking about who should be included in our future government .
leave us afghans alone and we will do best .
nawar , luton the un has to play a vital role in the creation of a broad-based care-taker government for afghanistan .
any attempt to impose a self-styled government based only on the majority of one section of the society will definitely lead to another dictatorial style government without any respect for the human rights .
the un can start to think in considering the former king zahir shah who commands respect and leadership of a large majority of afghans , irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds .
mahesh chandra somani , oulu , finland i think the northern alliance could be an alternative .
at least they are backed by countries like india and newly democratic power russia and iran rather than a bunch of " moderates " propped up by pakistanis .
experience has shown there are no moderate taliban .
patrick , usa the russians tried -lrb- for years -rrb- and failed to install a puppet government in afghanistan ben taylor , eston , england the russians tried -lrb- for years -rrb- and failed to install a puppet government in afghanistan , using all it 's military might .
do the us and british politicians really believe that a country and people that have lived with war for the past 25 years will just roll over and surrender after a few weeks of air raids ?
to oust the taleban and bring about real peace and democracy would require a massive military campaign with many thousands of troops on the ground .
western governments will shy away from this because of the possibility of ' body bags ' and perhaps quite a lot of them returning and lowering their popularity .
ben taylor , eston , england after reading some of the comments posted here , i am saddened to see that there are so many people who believe that the west and or the un has a right to determine the fate of the afghan people .
has n't the west already done enough ?
the rise of fundamentalism in afghanistan was supported by the us to combat the soviet presence there .
the billions of dollars that the us spent to fuel the war there , left millions of innocent afghans dead and a country torn to shreds .
if the super powers did not exploit the afghans for their own selfish reasons , the war in afghanistan probably would have ended a lot sooner and with less destruction .
south asia has always fought imperialism .
it is time that imperialism ends .
let the people of afghanistan and people of other developing countries start determining their own fate .
even if the government is despotic or tyrannical , it should be up to the people of those countries to fight for their own self-determination .
faisal , seattle , washington the question you pose is really the crux of the problem in afghanistan .
it seems that every one except the afghanis are involved in forming a government for afghanistan .
history should have taught us that afghanistan 's problems lie in the very fact that external forces have meddled in its affairs ostensibly for the good of the afghani people -lrb- or they justified it like that -rrb- and all they ended up doing was piling on more misery on the afghani people .
it seems we have not taken our lesson from history .
asif hadi , sydney , australia many of the comments show typical western arrogance , ignorance and cultural imperialism abdul kareem , karachi , pakistan many of the comments show typical western arrogance , ignorance , cultural imperialism and the belief that every one wishes to live like them .
afghani 's should be allowed to vote for their leaders in free and fair elections with universal suffrage which everyone including taleban should take part in - however as in the rest of the muslim world i doubt the us will support democracy - as it may mean the installation of a regime that refuses to do its bidding - so instead it will probably try -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to impose a stooge on afghanistan .
afghanistan is a muslim country - the attempts by the latter-day crusaders to make it otherwise would n't succeed abdul kareem , karachi , pakistan it is possible for a society to move from feudalism to socialism and still make tremendous progress .
a cuban model with a doze of islam is my recommendation .
since frugality is a virtue to the taleban one need not worry too much about corruption .
it would be much more desirable than a capitalist system which may enrich a few but will leave the majority in abject poverty .
with collapse of the soviet union the americans may not be too paranoid about such a state .
farouk dindar , canada interesting that not one of the above commentators here who support the taleban as the lesser of many evils is an afghani woman .
lisa , honolulu , usa i am not willing to tolerate those who are committed to " murdering " to further their own ambitions to gain power bill , mertztown , usa as long as there are people whose politics are concerned more with power than leadership , and who thrive on telling others how they ought to live , we will continue cycles of war and terror .
having said this , i also am not willing to tolerate those who are committed to " murdering " to further their own ambitions to gain power .
bill , mertztown , usa just look at history and you 'll know what will happen with the future govt. of afghanistan .
once again the u.s. and britain will hand-pick a puppet to head the country .
likely he will become king rather than be voted in democratically by the people .
this so the west can continue to control who replaces each successive king decade after decade , and as is done now in many other countries .
however , do n't rule out that the u.s. will have a strong military presence in this new kingdom . again just like in other mid-east countries .
this will set the west up nicely to monitor pakistan and other neighboring muslim countries ... and do n't forget china too !
and at who 's expense ?
just the poor afghan people who the u.s. government could care less about ... just like in iraq .
carolyn , usa as someone who remembers how exotic and mystical afghanistan used to be , today 's afghanistan shows what happens to people when civil wars rage and the rest of the world abandons them .
afghanistan is the world 's " dirty little secret " that has just come out of the closet .
the taleban must be obliterated since they are not representatives of the afghan people .
they are the creation of a foreign power seeking to annex sovereign lands through a proxy government .
certainly , the u.n. should play a role in the future of afghanistan , but the afghanis themselves must be allowed to choose their government .
whether it is a democracy , theocracy , or regency . leave that up to the ordinary afghanis .
the regional and world super-powers have a duty to pay for the reconstruction of afghanistan and to ensure all afghanis are allowed basic human rights and freedoms .
rita caywood , houston , texas i am not sure what the future of afghanistan will be or who should govern it .
quite frankly this discussion is purely academic .
for every solution we or the un come up with there will be a dozen countries to undermine it and point their fingers elsewhere .
i am certain however , that as long as the taleban are in power , al-qaeda will exist .
as long as al-qaeda exists the future is very bleak for all of us .
it is inconceivable that the taleban apologists should expect us to live with a gun to our head .
in my view it is an " us or them " situation .
if the pakistanis and afghans can not understand this , then let 's get down to settling it for good .
munro , canada the afghani congress of 1000 heads of cities / villages is meeting in pakistan presently and they represent all afghanis .
they have stated that the usa / britain planes must stop the bombing of their " $ 10 tents by $ 1,000,000 bombs " .
these are the leaders who should be respected .
the citizens of usa / britain can not afford this type of war .
will someone please use some intelligent thought and not an absurd , " white man 's burden " , logic .
charles digal , usa a new afghan government will only work if it rejects terrorism scott myatt , texas the people of afghanistan must be freed from the grip of mad-dog terrorists and self-serving despotic mullas .
clerics need to turn away from the secular power they have used to murder in the name of god .
it is evil to promote suicide and violence as honorable .
a new afghan government will only work if it reject terrorism and embrace humanitarianism as the will of god .
scott myatt , new braunfels , texas if this conflict ever ends successfully for the west and a government is imposed on afghanistan by the west then we will either see a replay of what is happening at the moment .
previous imposed leaders have been murdered , mutilated and displayed in public areas whilst a government of afghan people then take power .
or , we will see the same problem as that between israel and palestine right now .
if we wish to see an end to this problem then we should stop meddling in other countries affairs .
it will only breed more contempt and in another 50 years the whole sorry saga will start all over again .
we are currently reaping the errors of our previous politicians - the covert underhanded and undemocratic choices they have made in the past are now coming to forefront .
we certainly did n't ask for this , but the way our nations have acted in the past certainly did .
anon , only the citizens -lrb- including women -rrb- of afghanistan can decide who they want .
they can vote and choose the leaders from each tribe -lrb- pashtuns , tajiks , ujbeks , hazaras and other small groups -rrb- .
the afghani people did not choose the taliban government .
they took over .
but us , russia , and uk should definitely help rebuild the country they destroyed and continue to destroy .
they owe it to the afghani people .
ratna sengupta , usa i am unsure as to whether the british public realise that afghanistan was in a far worse state of affairs before the taliban took power .
however , that is comparing the worst with the second worse senario .
i would not like the northern alliance having any powers of government in the country because they are entirely unstable .
i wish the russians had taken it instead !
ronan quinn , dublin , ireland if you install a puppet , then you have to guard him sukanta , usa no puppet can be forced on afghans .
if you install a puppet , then you have to guard him , as many will be vying for his blood .
maybe afghanistan should be divided on ethnic line .
the un should fix boundaries between ethnic divisions .
an election should be held in each division .
basically , each ethnic division should have a self-rule .
there should be separation of divisional armed forces and political rulers .
people who are now fighting - including the northern alliance - should be disarmed .
peace at division borders should be monitored by un observers and the cost should be provided by cold war powers who have played at afghan bloods .
a un peace keeping army should be stationed at the afghan-pakistan border .
then the rulers of ethnic divisions should form a federation to promote cultural integrity to start with .
sukanta , tampa , usa a post-taleban government should be as representative as possible .
helle lykke jacobsen , denmark in order to avoid further strife , a post-taleban government should be as representative as possible .
the united nations should play a key role to facilitate such a government .
a possible solution with greater chances of success could be modelled after the swiss cantonal system with a kind of home-rule for local regions and a central government with rotating participation of the different ethnic parties / factions .
a new marshall - or rather powell-plan should help rebuild the country .
aid should be subject to strict conditions that human rights will be observed , especially those of women .
sharia law is inhuman and not acceptable -lrb- something mary robinson ought to have an opinion about -rrb- .
helle lykke jacobsen , copenhagen , denmark it 's wrong to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations - in this case , to impose a government .
however , the alternative in this case - of not doing so - is worse .
if the choice is between imposing what suits us and being terrorized by the festering , murderous alternative , then frankly i pick the former and i do n't care about principles .
a un-based body of external origin should be installed .
diedrich kohl , vancouver , canada " not untill the population are suffering are you sure that they are entirely submissive " - george orwell , ' 1984 ' .
this has never been more true than with the people of afganistan .
it angers me to read the comments of people supporting the ' political and social triumphs ' of the taleban .
make no mistake , this is despotism - the only thing that will save the afghani people is freedom ; freedom to choose , freedom to learn , freedom to vote , freedom to think - this will never be allowed within the confines of a taleban regime and is indeed what we are -lrb- in essence -rrb- fighting for .
removal of the taliban is not only desirable , it is neccessary to ensure the stability of the region .
the un has the funds and expertise to reform afghanistans social and economic structure , and this should be done for the good of the afghanistan people and no other reason pr , uk why not partition the country on tribal lines ?
paul t horgan , bracknell , england given that there may be a tribal context to the bitter rivalry between the northern alliance and the taleban why not partition the country on tribal lines with the tajiks in the north and the pashtuns in the south .
the south would have affinity with pakistan and fulfil their ambition to have a client state and the north would be an adjunct to tajikistan .
the benefit is that neither northern or southern afghanistan would be a client state of terrorists .
paul t horgan , bracknell , england the united nations , without a doubt .
there is no one group within afghanistan even remotely qualifed to run the country .
a un administration would obviously include afghans , but the leadership should be people not of the region ... deomcracy should be in place for the local / regional positions , but not the central administration until such time as suitable candidates have been matured .
we do n't want ot replace the current regime with another that is equally corrupt , unsecular or inept .
mark m. newdick , us / uk one wonders if the memory of some of our leaders is good john f , australia the west is again interfering in setting , or trying to put their own puppet at the head of a country .
the lesson has not been learned !
one wonders if the memory of some of our leaders is good - or maybe they think they learned the lesson and " are sure that they have now the right recipe " ..
it is the same on the battlefield !
do the " advisors " to our leaders have new fresh ideas ... such as trying a more human approach by putting people before economics for once ! ?
think human !
you will amazed to see that " they " are also human !
stop demonizing as you become like them too !
thank you for your attention , and may love , peace and understanding be our lot in the " new world " .
john f. , australia it is vital that the post-taleban regime bring stability to a country wrecked by 20 years of war , and establish the conditions for prosperity .
accordingly , afghanistan should be invited to become the 51st state of the usa .
shaun , london , uk the un and the west should assist in the formation of an interim government for at least two years .
the un model of east timor is a good example .
during this time , the infrastructure of the country should be rebuilt at least to a basic level .
this should then pave the way for a free and fair election .
those who put the united front -lrb- northern alliance -rrb- on par with the terrorists and the taleban are lacking in detailed knowlege of afghan history .
the united front is a legitimate representative of the majority of the afghan population .
this will be proven once free and fair elctions are held .
khalil nasri , australia the western world should be careful , in not being seen , to be imposing upon the afghan people , a government which has no popular support .
while it is true that the taleban have imposed some draconian measures , it is still by far the most popular of the factions in afghanistan .
one must not forget that prior to the taleban , the other factions were not able to govern afghanistan and there was a complete breakdown in the law and order .
therefore , if the taleban falls , an interim government should be formed involving all the disparate ethnic groups including the moderate taleban , under the auspices of the united nations .
muslim countries should , under the un , provide members for a security / peace force for maintaining law and order .
to succeed any future plans would have to be based on , the sharia and the local jirga concept .
arif sayed , dubai , uae the taleban are the real government of afghanistan syed salman jalal kakakhel , peshawar , pakistan the taleban are the real government of afghanistan .
everyone is wondering who will form that government in the future .
i do n't know why they are neglecting the taleban , who are in control of 90 % of afghanistan .
the us and the west in general are opposing the taleban purely for their own benefit , not for that of the afghan people .
syed salman jalal kakakhel , peshawar , pakistan afghanistan 's future is unlikely to be any different from either its past or its present .
regardless of what happens in this present war , it will remain a veritable pawn used cynically by one opportunistic group or another to serve its partisan purposes .
sriraman annaswamy , sydney , australia / madras , india in response to lori 's comments .
why does the west always think of imposing its social mores on others ?
it is for afghans to decide what type of government they will have .
before imposing its government on afghanistan , the west should ask itself how it would feel if afghanistan was a powerful country and bombed america to remove what it thought was an oppressive regime .
kg , india what afghanistan needs is a legitimate government .
unfortunately , even the perceived legitimacy of the democratic -lrb- but extremely corrupt -rrb- governments of russia and india has been called into question .
the taleban have shown , whether we like it or not , that the only government that can maintain legitimacy in afghanistan , and thus reduce drug cultivation and enforce disarmament , is an islamic state , in name and practice .
henry , ann arbor , usa neither the taleban nor the northern alliance are capable of handling their own country .
it 's time for the americans and the british to take full control of afghan affairs .
mohammed imtiaz , hong kong the unseating of the taleban from power would just represent a new phase in the civil conflict in afghanistan bailo b jallow , london , uk the imminent unseating of the taleban from power would just represent a new phase in the civil conflict in afghanistan and not an end to it .
afghans of all ethnic backgrounds would only be able to peacefully co-exist together when countries like pakistan , india , russia , and of course the usa do not seek to impose their own regimes on the afghan people .
bailo b jallow , london , uk american bombers seem to be bombing dust .
or at best , rubble into dust .
what is this campaign achieving anyway ?
of the billions that america spent in afghanistan during the cold war , not a shard of that was spent on anything constructive .
all of it was for weapons for american ideals .
america seems to be adding to the total number of world casualties in the wake of the wtc attacks .
the taleban and the northern alliance are both guilty of pathetic and barbarous human rights offences .
now they want zahir shah to take over .
how sad for the afghan people that someone like him is their only hope , albeit better than the taleban .
this is indeed a sad war .
razal , vienna , usa who will rule afghanistan ?

select the link below to watch talking point on air : 56k modems a senior pentagon official says the taleban departure from the afghan capital of kabul is " great news " .
taleban forces have abandoned kabul , fleeing south overnight as contingents of northern alliance troops entered the city .
but un secretary general kofi annan says the un must " move quickly " to help set up a representative government in afghanistan .
the pakistani government has made it clear it did not want the northern alliance to take kabul and they wanted it to be a demilitarised zone .
foreign ministry spokesman aziz ahmed khan said : " until the setting up of a multi-ethnic dispensation , no single group should occupy kabul . "
who should govern afghanistan when , and if , the taleban falls ?
should the taleban and the northern alliance play a part in any new administration ?
who should decide ?
this debate has now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme the us are now funding the northern alliance .
did n't they fund bin laden a few years ago ?
there was a lesson to learn there , has bush jnr missed it ?
dave , uk i think none of the leaders nor warriors should be elected to govern afghanistan mohammad zaher , indiana , usa i think none of the leaders nor warriors should be elected to govern afghanistan .
i think we should bring in educated persons with diverse ethnic backgrounds .
i say to pakistan 's president musharraf : please leave us alone , please leave the people of afghanistan alone .
who are you to decide the future of our country ?
mohammad zaher , indiana , usa the people of afghanistan should be their own government .
all the different tribes of the country have to sit down and try to establish a working government voted in by the people to help rebuild their country , for the interest of the people .
the outside communities should not be directly involved , for this would be another invasion of their country .
help rebuild and , when the afghanistan government is put in place peacefully , let free press , tvand radio re-enter the country so the people have the choice to live their lives without any oppression .
educated afghanistan people are living outside of their country and , if they can be assured re-entry to help their families and friends , then they might have a chance to .
good education for all men and women is the only way .
asherah , canada i think that if a broad-based government is established , the disputes will become intensified .
different people come from different groups .
some are radical and some are moderate .
this will lead to more quarrels .
just like japan after the second world war - it became very weak .
it was transferred into a democratic country .
although it is still a highly industrialized and rich country , it is very weak because there are too many different ideas from different groups .
therefore afghanistan will remain a weak country .
and many rebellions are coming soon .
jambon the only way to stop the endless war would be partition of afghanistan along ethnic lines alam , usa the fragmentation of afghanistan along ethnic lines has gone too far and bringing different ethnic groups living in the country under one flag seems highly unrealistic .
whether we like it or not , the only way to stop the endless war in afghanistan would be its partition along ethnic lines .
neither zakhir shah nor the united states or any other great power will be able to put together what had already broken apart .
the ethnic divide is way too deep , " thanks " to the taleban regime and its policy of pashtunization .
alam , usa can mr rumsfeld kindly define the " post-taliban " era ?
taliban were a result of dynamic afghan changes .
they will always remain in afghanistan armed to their teeth even if the alliance takes over kabul .
mohammad ali bangash , karachi , pakistan although i agree with the bombing campaign , i do feel it will achieve very little for afghanistan .
even if we do set up a full democratic society , it will be toppled in a few years and fall backwards into civil war and decay .
it takes an intelligent government to rule a democratic country .
the rulers must be fair and not corrupt .
also religion and politics do not mix .
if you look at any successful country , religion plays very little part in the lifestyle of people or government .
the country has to be run by intelligent and educated people and not simply by old outdated religious values .
personally , i think there is very little the west can do for nations like afghanistan .
they have to evolve themselves and not be thrust into a democracy they have never had .
let 's get bin laden , overthrow the taliban and just leave them to squabble it out themselves .
phil matthews , uk the last two decades have left afghanistan fragmented and lawless naveed kamal , karachi , pakistan the last two decades have left afghanistan fragmented and lawless .
we have the taleban on one hand and various factions of the northern alliance on the other .
none of these truly represents the afghan people and their aspirations .
the best way to ensure peace and tranquillity in afghanistan is through focus on its economic and social development .
neither the taleban nor the northern alliance should have any role in a post-taleban government .
naveed kamal , karachi , pakistan i think george w bush should be the new president of afghanistan since he is clearly more interested in meddling with the affairs of foreign countries than sorting out his own domestic problems , then perhaps he would do more for the us than he does at present .
anon , london , uk afghanistan is one of those places that no matter who 's in power , there will be trouble .
maybe a coalition of tribes will be a better type of government but it will have to include the taliban .
no one group can run a country like afghanistan .
russ black , usa i do n't think the people of any country except the afghans themselves have got a right to decide or discuss who should rule afghanistan zia mian , lahore , pakistan give me a break ! ! !
there wo n't be anything left to govern ! !
we bomb the country to bits and pieces and then we expect there will be something there to govern ? ? ?
j. cunningham , usa it seems that the united states is damned if we do help and damned if we do n't chad , seattle , usa it seems that the united states is damned if we do help and damned if we do n't .
if the us sat back and let the taleban murder people for something as normal as wanting to work , then people would want to know how we could let this happen .
do you think it 's right to suppress women as they do just because they are n't physically strong enough to fight back ?
also , can you imagine what terrorism would be like in 10 years if we left afghanistan and the taleban alone ?
i guarantee that our leaders in washington have thought this out long and hard .
chad , seattle , usa i think an american and british military government would work fine .
notice that germany and japan are democratic today .
the occupation in those countries lasted only a few years but worked wonders .
larry hastings , san diego , usa the only afghan future the usa is concerned with is to install a us-friendly government that will give it full rights to laying oil pipeline in the country .
who cares about the people ?
not the usa for a start .
zaheer mahmood , sheffield , uk we need to make afghanistan a model example of what the western world can do when liberating an oppressed people robert morpheal , canada the future of afghanistan rests upon the dethroning of the teleban .
any country that has become militarised and oppressed under an extremist regime requires longer term involvement on the part of its liberators .
it also requires reconstruction , as well as pacification .
we have seen successful examples in the instance of japan and germany post world war ii .
both countries were pacified and assisted in long term rebuilding subsequent to their suffering in the war .
both german fascism and japanese extremism that terrorised pearl harbour were ultimately defeated .
both countries were rebuilt , politically , economically , and ideologically .
we need to see the same intensity of long term effort in afghanistan to make it a model example of what the western world can do when liberating an oppressed people .
it is only in that manner that the war can ultimately be won .
robert morpheal , canada i believe a broad-based government should be formed under the supervision of the united nations .
the afghans should be allowed to elect their leaders democratically .
such a government , when in place , needs to be given the required foreign aids to be able to meet the aspirations of the populace .
onabamiro adebamiro , kaduna , nigeria the irony of it all - president bush and his partner tony blair have nothing against the people of afghanistan .
except , of course to kill them .
and kill them they do without mercy and in droves .
they do not do that to israel or to the ira .
the labour party has always been thought to be people-centrist , but now blair is directly responsible for killing innocent afghans .
would america and its puppet please leave afghanistan alone .
khalid , dar es salaam , tanzania too many other countries ' governments just use afghanistan as a stomping ground for their armies to slog it out and the poor locals get the full blast of all the cross-fire .
it is far too obvious that afghanistan , so severely devastated that its people just simply do not have the strength or ability to stand on their own feet and maintain a stable fair system of management for their ruined country .
selma , england afghanistan is the land of the afghans - let them decide who rules their country mr v patel , london afghanistan is the land of the afghans - let them decide who rules their country .
many comments on this site say that western countries should intervene .
how would britain and america like it if afghanistan said who should govern them ?
mr v patel , london i believe that there is already a legitimate government in afghanistan but if the people there feel that they do need a change , a popular uprising would be okay .
but i do not support the idea of americans going around the world telling the afghans who should or should not be their government .
benjamin , accra , ghana maybe i 'm missing something here but what has the taleban done apart from harbour various terrorists wanted by the us ?
i do n't like their human rights record anymore than anyone else but i do n't agree with this bombing .
alex banks , waterford , ireland -lrb- british -rrb- when afghans are leaving the country in millions and those left behind are dying of starvation what is the point of having a government there ?
run a country inhabited by few hundred people ?
it would be better if afghanistan became part of pakistan for an indefinite period .
at least the aid agencies would be able get to the starving masses .
mahesh srinivasan , manchester , uk i think we are missing the point here .
it matters not one iota who governs afghanistan so long as they are prepared for the yanks to lay an oil pipeline to carry uzbeck oil through their country .
rhys hughes , wales i , for one , am not entirely convinced that the taleban are the enemy .
i think there is conclusive evidence to support the theory of iraqi involvement .
firstly , saddam bears , at least two , grudges particularly against the us and britain .
secondly , i heard on cnn that the head hijacker met twice with a known iraqi intelligence officer .
in short , there is a plethora of evidence to support the theory that iraq was involved .
make your own judgement .
peter bolton , uk in usa the afghan king is the only person who can restore the nation pisut ruttanaporn , usa the afghan king is the only person who can restore the nation .
the election is a solution to find out what afghan people want .
however , it has to be done under the supervision of the united nations .
pisut ruttanaporn , chicago ridge usa let the people decide for themselves and respect their sovereignty .
solvere cog there was no racial and ethnic dispute between the afghan people ¿ until the taliban were brought into afghanistan by the pakistani government to act as their puppets , and one of the ways that the taliban have been successful is through their division of the afghan people ¿ by separating the pashtoons from tajiks and hazaras .
the major problem for any new government would be how to bring everyone under one flag .
mustafa hedayat , australia any solution for a post-war afghanistan , would have to be based on a strong central government , capable of applying , by force if necessary , the dictat of that government .
only a strong central government could run the country .
stuart montgomery singapore your comments during the programme the afghans should decide ... they should be allowed to make their own mistakes geraldyn yap , singapore i think the afghans should decide on the future of their country and the form of government - they should be allowed to make their own mistakes .
the decision should not be affected by what the western powers think and the western powers should not adopt the condescending attitude that they know what is best for the afghan people .
geraldyn yap , singapore it is sad but true , today in afghanistan there are no suitable factions or groups that are capable of ruling a country .
we have seen taliban and northen alliance , and they are just warlords and thugs .
and pakistan would never want a government which will solely in work for benefit of afghans .
i think america and the west have to play a big role in future of afghanistan .
king could be a wise choice .
forough alifi , australia it 's very easy to sit in front of the computer with a hot cup of tea and express our intellectual thoughts .
i am surprised to see that people from different parts of the world are suggesting that afghanistan should be broken and different parts should be distributed among the neighbouring countries as if its a piece of cake !
but do they ever think about the feelings of an afghan person before expressing such comments ?
khaled , uk as an afghan i agree with the people who said " let afghans make the post-taliban government themselves " , but in reality we can not do it alone in this desperate situation .
we need super power countries like us and uk to stay behind us in this mission. ehsan , ipswich , uk extremist fractions within taliban and the whole northern alliance should be excluded latif and ziam , norway the future government should consist of king zahir shah and representatives of all the ethnic groups according to their percentage .
extremist fractions within taliban and the whole northern alliance should be excluded from all future governments in afghanistan .
the neighbouring countries have been involved in the suffering of the afghan nation more than enough .
they are not the ones who should decide what kind of government afghanistan should have in the future .
latif and ziam , norway your comments before we went on air even if the taleban are toppled , that wo n't mean that afghanistan will have a eutopian society .
all the afghan tribesmen -lrb- including the na -rrb- have said that any proxy government that the west tries to install , i.e. the shah , will be will be opposed by force .
more war and bloodshed .
an election will almost certainly produce a relatively religiously hardline government anyway , because that 's what most afghanis are !
ibn masood , uk here you are deciding what should be the future of afghanistan .
that 's ok .
lets make a deal .
you people decide the future of afghanistan and let the people of afghanistan decide the future of your countries ?
how about that ? jasm , peshawar since there appears to be no kind of ethnic cohesion in afghanistan there is no reason to maintain its status as a sovereign state .
why not hand the pashtun areas to pakistan and unite the uzbek and tajik areas with their respective states .
as long as we can maintain sound governments in those countries then we should have no more trouble from the afghans .
pete whitehead , uk a bit late to be thinking about this .
the monarchy should be restored until the whole nation is given the opportunity to decide how to proceed .
in reality , it is nobodys business except the afghans .
john atkins , bridgwater , england the hope that afghanistan can survive as a stable entity is a myth .
a decade of relentless civil war has proven that the different ethnic factions in afghanistan are incapable of a peaceful co-existence under one flag .
in such a case , the best scenario would be to dissolve the durand line , amalgamate the pashtun areas with pakistan , and cede the rest to those central asian republics bordering afghanistan , and having large ethnic minorities there .
faisal aziz , islamabad , pakistan how about a un appointed government , selecting educated afghanis either living in afghanistan or ex-patriots who fled the country during the oppression to stand for election ?
hyder , las vegas , usa who are we to decide upon the rulers of afghanistan ?
in the case of taleban , i think without large-scale grassroot support they could n't have managed to control 95 % of afghanistan .
it seems rather farcical to me that the west should flatten the country with bombs , and then expect everything to be hunky dory .
fahim , london , uk the hope of building a broad-based government in afghanistan is unrealistic mushtaq , london , uk the hope of building a broad-based government in afghanistan is unrealistic .
the ethnic divisions in the country are too deep .
afghanistan has never been a stable and unified country except for short periods .
if the taleban fall , the only realistic solution will be to divide the country along ethnic lines .
this division may result in some transfer of population , but that will be preferable to endless bloodshed which an attempt to maintain a united afghanistan will cause .
mushtaq , london , uk let the afghan people decide .
does pakistan have broad-based government ?
they really have double standards .
when it suits them they implant dictators and when circumstances change , they say the rules of game have changed .
they are really bad players and bad umpires to be shunned and banned .
muhammad arshad , lahore , pakistan leave us afghans alone and we will do best nawar , luton as an afghan i am fed up to listen to other talking about who should be included in our future government .
leave us afghans alone and we will do best .
nawar , luton the un has to play a vital role in the creation of a broad-based care-taker government for afghanistan .
any attempt to impose a self-styled government based only on the majority of one section of the society will definitely lead to another dictatorial style government without any respect for the human rights .
the un can start to think in considering the former king zahir shah who commands respect and leadership of a large majority of afghans , irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds .
mahesh chandra somani , oulu , finland i think the northern alliance could be an alternative .
at least they are backed by countries like india and newly democratic power russia and iran rather than a bunch of " moderates " propped up by pakistanis .
experience has shown there are no moderate taliban .
patrick , usa the russians tried -lrb- for years -rrb- and failed to install a puppet government in afghanistan ben taylor , eston , england the russians tried -lrb- for years -rrb- and failed to install a puppet government in afghanistan , using all it 's military might .
do the us and british politicians really believe that a country and people that have lived with war for the past 25 years will just roll over and surrender after a few weeks of air raids ?
to oust the taleban and bring about real peace and democracy would require a massive military campaign with many thousands of troops on the ground .
western governments will shy away from this because of the possibility of ' body bags ' and perhaps quite a lot of them returning and lowering their popularity .
ben taylor , eston , england after reading some of the comments posted here , i am saddened to see that there are so many people who believe that the west and or the un has a right to determine the fate of the afghan people .
has n't the west already done enough ?
the rise of fundamentalism in afghanistan was supported by the us to combat the soviet presence there .
the billions of dollars that the us spent to fuel the war there , left millions of innocent afghans dead and a country torn to shreds .
if the super powers did not exploit the afghans for their own selfish reasons , the war in afghanistan probably would have ended a lot sooner and with less destruction .
south asia has always fought imperialism .
it is time that imperialism ends .
let the people of afghanistan and people of other developing countries start determining their own fate .
even if the government is despotic or tyrannical , it should be up to the people of those countries to fight for their own self-determination .
faisal , seattle , washington the question you pose is really the crux of the problem in afghanistan .
it seems that every one except the afghanis are involved in forming a government for afghanistan .
history should have taught us that afghanistan 's problems lie in the very fact that external forces have meddled in its affairs ostensibly for the good of the afghani people -lrb- or they justified it like that -rrb- and all they ended up doing was piling on more misery on the afghani people .
it seems we have not taken our lesson from history .
asif hadi , sydney , australia many of the comments show typical western arrogance , ignorance and cultural imperialism abdul kareem , karachi , pakistan many of the comments show typical western arrogance , ignorance , cultural imperialism and the belief that every one wishes to live like them .
afghani 's should be allowed to vote for their leaders in free and fair elections with universal suffrage which everyone including taleban should take part in - however as in the rest of the muslim world i doubt the us will support democracy - as it may mean the installation of a regime that refuses to do its bidding - so instead it will probably try -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- to impose a stooge on afghanistan .
afghanistan is a muslim country - the attempts by the latter-day crusaders to make it otherwise would n't succeed abdul kareem , karachi , pakistan it is possible for a society to move from feudalism to socialism and still make tremendous progress .
a cuban model with a doze of islam is my recommendation .
since frugality is a virtue to the taleban one need not worry too much about corruption .
it would be much more desirable than a capitalist system which may enrich a few but will leave the majority in abject poverty .
with collapse of the soviet union the americans may not be too paranoid about such a state .
farouk dindar , canada interesting that not one of the above commentators here who support the taleban as the lesser of many evils is an afghani woman .
lisa , honolulu , usa i am not willing to tolerate those who are committed to " murdering " to further their own ambitions to gain power bill , mertztown , usa as long as there are people whose politics are concerned more with power than leadership , and who thrive on telling others how they ought to live , we will continue cycles of war and terror .
having said this , i also am not willing to tolerate those who are committed to " murdering " to further their own ambitions to gain power .
bill , mertztown , usa just look at history and you 'll know what will happen with the future govt. of afghanistan .
once again the u.s. and britain will hand-pick a puppet to head the country .
likely he will become king rather than be voted in democratically by the people .
this so the west can continue to control who replaces each successive king decade after decade , and as is done now in many other countries .
however , do n't rule out that the u.s. will have a strong military presence in this new kingdom . again just like in other mid-east countries .
this will set the west up nicely to monitor pakistan and other neighboring muslim countries ... and do n't forget china too !
and at who 's expense ?
just the poor afghan people who the u.s. government could care less about ... just like in iraq .
carolyn , usa as someone who remembers how exotic and mystical afghanistan used to be , today 's afghanistan shows what happens to people when civil wars rage and the rest of the world abandons them .
afghanistan is the world 's " dirty little secret " that has just come out of the closet .
the taleban must be obliterated since they are not representatives of the afghan people .
they are the creation of a foreign power seeking to annex sovereign lands through a proxy government .
certainly , the u.n. should play a role in the future of afghanistan , but the afghanis themselves must be allowed to choose their government .
whether it is a democracy , theocracy , or regency . leave that up to the ordinary afghanis .
the regional and world super-powers have a duty to pay for the reconstruction of afghanistan and to ensure all afghanis are allowed basic human rights and freedoms .
rita caywood , houston , texas i am not sure what the future of afghanistan will be or who should govern it .
quite frankly this discussion is purely academic .
for every solution we or the un come up with there will be a dozen countries to undermine it and point their fingers elsewhere .
i am certain however , that as long as the taleban are in power , al-qaeda will exist .
as long as al-qaeda exists the future is very bleak for all of us .
it is inconceivable that the taleban apologists should expect us to live with a gun to our head .
in my view it is an " us or them " situation .
if the pakistanis and afghans can not understand this , then let 's get down to settling it for good .
munro , canada the afghani congress of 1000 heads of cities / villages is meeting in pakistan presently and they represent all afghanis .
they have stated that the usa / britain planes must stop the bombing of their " $ 10 tents by $ 1,000,000 bombs " .
these are the leaders who should be respected .
the citizens of usa / britain can not afford this type of war .
will someone please use some intelligent thought and not an absurd , " white man 's burden " , logic .
charles digal , usa a new afghan government will only work if it rejects terrorism scott myatt , texas the people of afghanistan must be freed from the grip of mad-dog terrorists and self-serving despotic mullas .
clerics need to turn away from the secular power they have used to murder in the name of god .
it is evil to promote suicide and violence as honorable .
a new afghan government will only work if it reject terrorism and embrace humanitarianism as the will of god .
scott myatt , new braunfels , texas if this conflict ever ends successfully for the west and a government is imposed on afghanistan by the west then we will either see a replay of what is happening at the moment .
previous imposed leaders have been murdered , mutilated and displayed in public areas whilst a government of afghan people then take power .
or , we will see the same problem as that between israel and palestine right now .
if we wish to see an end to this problem then we should stop meddling in other countries affairs .
it will only breed more contempt and in another 50 years the whole sorry saga will start all over again .
we are currently reaping the errors of our previous politicians - the covert underhanded and undemocratic choices they have made in the past are now coming to forefront .
we certainly did n't ask for this , but the way our nations have acted in the past certainly did .
anon , only the citizens -lrb- including women -rrb- of afghanistan can decide who they want .
they can vote and choose the leaders from each tribe -lrb- pashtuns , tajiks , ujbeks , hazaras and other small groups -rrb- .
the afghani people did not choose the taliban government .
they took over .
but us , russia , and uk should definitely help rebuild the country they destroyed and continue to destroy .
they owe it to the afghani people .
ratna sengupta , usa i am unsure as to whether the british public realise that afghanistan was in a far worse state of affairs before the taliban took power .
however , that is comparing the worst with the second worse senario .
i would not like the northern alliance having any powers of government in the country because they are entirely unstable .
i wish the russians had taken it instead !
ronan quinn , dublin , ireland if you install a puppet , then you have to guard him sukanta , usa no puppet can be forced on afghans .
if you install a puppet , then you have to guard him , as many will be vying for his blood .
maybe afghanistan should be divided on ethnic line .
the un should fix boundaries between ethnic divisions .
an election should be held in each division .
basically , each ethnic division should have a self-rule .
there should be separation of divisional armed forces and political rulers .
people who are now fighting - including the northern alliance - should be disarmed .
peace at division borders should be monitored by un observers and the cost should be provided by cold war powers who have played at afghan bloods .
a un peace keeping army should be stationed at the afghan-pakistan border .
then the rulers of ethnic divisions should form a federation to promote cultural integrity to start with .
sukanta , tampa , usa a post-taleban government should be as representative as possible .
helle lykke jacobsen , denmark in order to avoid further strife , a post-taleban government should be as representative as possible .
the united nations should play a key role to facilitate such a government .
a possible solution with greater chances of success could be modelled after the swiss cantonal system with a kind of home-rule for local regions and a central government with rotating participation of the different ethnic parties / factions .
a new marshall - or rather powell-plan should help rebuild the country .
aid should be subject to strict conditions that human rights will be observed , especially those of women .
sharia law is inhuman and not acceptable -lrb- something mary robinson ought to have an opinion about -rrb- .
helle lykke jacobsen , copenhagen , denmark it 's wrong to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations - in this case , to impose a government .
however , the alternative in this case - of not doing so - is worse .
if the choice is between imposing what suits us and being terrorized by the festering , murderous alternative , then frankly i pick the former and i do n't care about principles .
a un-based body of external origin should be installed .
diedrich kohl , vancouver , canada " not untill the population are suffering are you sure that they are entirely submissive " - george orwell , ' 1984 ' .
this has never been more true than with the people of afganistan .
it angers me to read the comments of people supporting the ' political and social triumphs ' of the taleban .
make no mistake , this is despotism - the only thing that will save the afghani people is freedom ; freedom to choose , freedom to learn , freedom to vote , freedom to think - this will never be allowed within the confines of a taleban regime and is indeed what we are -lrb- in essence -rrb- fighting for .
removal of the taliban is not only desirable , it is neccessary to ensure the stability of the region .
the un has the funds and expertise to reform afghanistans social and economic structure , and this should be done for the good of the afghanistan people and no other reason pr , uk why not partition the country on tribal lines ?
paul t horgan , bracknell , england given that there may be a tribal context to the bitter rivalry between the northern alliance and the taleban why not partition the country on tribal lines with the tajiks in the north and the pashtuns in the south .
the south would have affinity with pakistan and fulfil their ambition to have a client state and the north would be an adjunct to tajikistan .
the benefit is that neither northern or southern afghanistan would be a client state of terrorists .
paul t horgan , bracknell , england the united nations , without a doubt .
there is no one group within afghanistan even remotely qualifed to run the country .
a un administration would obviously include afghans , but the leadership should be people not of the region ... deomcracy should be in place for the local / regional positions , but not the central administration until such time as suitable candidates have been matured .
we do n't want ot replace the current regime with another that is equally corrupt , unsecular or inept .
mark m. newdick , us / uk one wonders if the memory of some of our leaders is good john f , australia the west is again interfering in setting , or trying to put their own puppet at the head of a country .
the lesson has not been learned !
one wonders if the memory of some of our leaders is good - or maybe they think they learned the lesson and " are sure that they have now the right recipe " ..
it is the same on the battlefield !
do the " advisors " to our leaders have new fresh ideas ... such as trying a more human approach by putting people before economics for once ! ?
think human !
you will amazed to see that " they " are also human !
stop demonizing as you become like them too !
thank you for your attention , and may love , peace and understanding be our lot in the " new world " .
john f. , australia it is vital that the post-taleban regime bring stability to a country wrecked by 20 years of war , and establish the conditions for prosperity .
accordingly , afghanistan should be invited to become the 51st state of the usa .
shaun , london , uk the un and the west should assist in the formation of an interim government for at least two years .
the un model of east timor is a good example .
during this time , the infrastructure of the country should be rebuilt at least to a basic level .
this should then pave the way for a free and fair election .
those who put the united front -lrb- northern alliance -rrb- on par with the terrorists and the taleban are lacking in detailed knowlege of afghan history .
the united front is a legitimate representative of the majority of the afghan population .
this will be proven once free and fair elctions are held .
khalil nasri , australia the western world should be careful , in not being seen , to be imposing upon the afghan people , a government which has no popular support .
while it is true that the taleban have imposed some draconian measures , it is still by far the most popular of the factions in afghanistan .
one must not forget that prior to the taleban , the other factions were not able to govern afghanistan and there was a complete breakdown in the law and order .
therefore , if the taleban falls , an interim government should be formed involving all the disparate ethnic groups including the moderate taleban , under the auspices of the united nations .
muslim countries should , under the un , provide members for a security / peace force for maintaining law and order .
to succeed any future plans would have to be based on , the sharia and the local jirga concept .
arif sayed , dubai , uae the taleban are the real government of afghanistan syed salman jalal kakakhel , peshawar , pakistan the taleban are the real government of afghanistan .
everyone is wondering who will form that government in the future .
i do n't know why they are neglecting the taleban , who are in control of 90 % of afghanistan .
the us and the west in general are opposing the taleban purely for their own benefit , not for that of the afghan people .
syed salman jalal kakakhel , peshawar , pakistan afghanistan 's future is unlikely to be any different from either its past or its present .
regardless of what happens in this present war , it will remain a veritable pawn used cynically by one opportunistic group or another to serve its partisan purposes .
sriraman annaswamy , sydney , australia / madras , india in response to lori 's comments .
why does the west always think of imposing its social mores on others ?
it is for afghans to decide what type of government they will have .
before imposing its government on afghanistan , the west should ask itself how it would feel if afghanistan was a powerful country and bombed america to remove what it thought was an oppressive regime .
kg , india what afghanistan needs is a legitimate government .
unfortunately , even the perceived legitimacy of the democratic -lrb- but extremely corrupt -rrb- governments of russia and india has been called into question .
the taleban have shown , whether we like it or not , that the only government that can maintain legitimacy in afghanistan , and thus reduce drug cultivation and enforce disarmament , is an islamic state , in name and practice .
henry , ann arbor , usa neither the taleban nor the northern alliance are capable of handling their own country .
it 's time for the americans and the british to take full control of afghan affairs .
mohammed imtiaz , hong kong the unseating of the taleban from power would just represent a new phase in the civil conflict in afghanistan bailo b jallow , london , uk the imminent unseating of the taleban from power would just represent a new phase in the civil conflict in afghanistan and not an end to it .
afghans of all ethnic backgrounds would only be able to peacefully co-exist together when countries like pakistan , india , russia , and of course the usa do not seek to impose their own regimes on the afghan people .
bailo b jallow , london , uk american bombers seem to be bombing dust .
or at best , rubble into dust .
what is this campaign achieving anyway ?
of the billions that america spent in afghanistan during the cold war , not a shard of that was spent on anything constructive .
all of it was for weapons for american ideals .
america seems to be adding to the total number of world casualties in the wake of the wtc attacks .
the taleban and the northern alliance are both guilty of pathetic and barbarous human rights offences .
now they want zahir shah to take over .
how sad for the afghan people that someone like him is their only hope , albeit better than the taleban .
this is indeed a sad war .
razal , vienna , usa who will rule afghanistan ?
whoever allows america to build an oil pipeline across the country , i would have thought .
chris , uk looking at the present situation , the whole social infrastructure of the country has been destroyed by the fighting that has been going on for years .
the only chance of afghans reconstructing their homeland is if american interference stops for good .
syed najaf afghan , islamabad , pakistan this is an opportunity for real statesmanship ian , auckland , new zealand historically , the western world has had some successes and failures in this type of venture .
japan , after being run by militaristic hardliners and being ravaged by wwii , was successfully transformed into a modern vibrant democracy .
this should serve as a model .
the events in new york have demonstrated that the first world can not leave the third world to fester with impunity .
this is an opportunity for real statesmanship .
ian , auckland , new zealand once a totalitarian oppressive regime is toppled , self-governance amongst its people depends largely on their level of education and on how liberal that education has been .
in a country such as afghanistan , there is a problem .
it is a country where ignorance is the instilled condition and where many have been taught to believe that one religious scripture , that originates 1400 and more years ago , is the sole and sufficient basis for all scientific , political , economic and social knowledge sufficient and necessary to all social needs .
that only worsens the problem of self-governance .
it is nearly impossible .
britain did a good job in bringing education to its colonies , and in fact that example might well be appropriate to afghanistan .
the united nations might be granted governance until education is more liberal and universal in afghanistan so that a true and effective democratic and constitutional system can be effected .
afghanistan as a un protectorate is not unthinkable , but with an international military presence to enforce the peace until it is ready to rule and protect itself .
afghanistan is merely a child to the western world and it must be understood as such .
what the western world does with the upbringing of that child will be on its conscience and is its responsibility .
robert morpheal , canada i believe that the us has been wronged and that it deserves revenge against the people that have committed this horrifying act .
but i also think that afghan civilians should n't be punished for the evil acts of others .
paige munroe , vancouver , canada the question of " what future for afghanistan after the taleban " is a typical western query and is itself the root cause of terrorism in the first place .
what business of ours is the future of afghanistan ?
apart from self interest and warmongering ?
what if the muslim world were debating whether or not to invade the usa in order to restore democracy after the corruption resulting in bush stealing the presidency for the big money power brokers ?
what if they decided to bomb london to teach britain a lesson for oppressing the irish ?
people do n't embark on suicide missions without good cause so why do n't we use this moment in history to find out what is driving people to such desperate behaviour .
by bombing afghanistan to rubble in a futile bid for revenge , america is worsening the rift between the west and the rest of the world and we 're all going to suffer for generations to come .
america should get its nose out of other people 's affairs for a change and stop trying to rearrange the world under its own image .
us citizens might believe all that nonsense about the " land of the free " but i do n't think what 's left of the native american tribes are taken in by that .
wake up america - leave the world alone , you 're causing nothing but trouble .
erik thomas , grimsby , england this mess will take decades to unravel charles moore , edinburgh , scotland the assumption being made is that this conflict will end with a pacified afghanistan ready for a civil society to be rebuilt .
fat chance !
there will be a rump of taleban left fighting a withering guerrilla war , the various factions in the northern alliance will be fighting each other and the regional powers of pakistan , india , iran , russia , turkey and others , will return to supporting their favoured factions .
this mess will take decades to unravel .
charles moore , edinburgh , scotland the question of who should govern a post-taleban afghanistan is absolutely none of our business .
we are attacking the taleban because they have refused to hand over osama bin laden .
if the present regime collapses as a result , it is up to the afghan people to decide who should replace the taleban .
it is most certainly not the responsibility of the usa or the uk to make that decision for them .
to bomb the hell out of an unfortunate country is one thing - to then dictate how it 's going to be governed is adding arrogant insult to massive injury .
let 's just do what has to be done as quickly and painlessly as possible , and allow these poor people the luxury and novelty of deciding their own future .
c bingham-hunter , bedford , england the idea of c. bingham-hunter that we " do what has to be done as quickly and painlessly as possible , and allow these poor people the luxury and novelty of deciding their own future " makes me wonder if he has any idea of the state of afghanistan prior to the current action , never mind if the taleban crumble .
surely the luxury and novelty of having an infrastructure and enough to eat would be a good start ?
it is horrendous and short sighted to suggest in the name of afghani autonomy that the west bomb them out of even the repulsive government they have now , and then just say " there you go , over to you - we have no right to assist you in your recovery " .
alison lowe , london , uk may i please say to alison lowe that i agree entirely with most of her expressed sentiments .
my original point - now in carefully simplified form - was that it seems outrageous to attack a derelict country like afghanistan , possibly oust the extant government , and then assume the right to insert an administration which meets our specifications .
having lived for many years in third world countries , and as a speaker of arabic , i am possibly more aware than ms lowe of the crippling predicament and hardships long endured by those unfortunate people .
and , if we are not very careful , our lasting legacy to them will be a situation somewhat worse than it was before we arrived .
c.bingham-hunter , uk c. bingham-hunter , bedford , england it 's going to take centuries for the country to become safe tim , london the job of policing afghanistan is too big for the us , the un or anyone for that matter .
the only way is to form a loose coalition government with representatives from all corners and try to guide the country through the long process of reform .
but it 's going to take centuries for the country to become safe , if ever .
tim , london , uk the million dollar question is ' will the taleban fall ? '
this has to be kept in mind , as three weeks of successive bombing has not affected them on a large scale .
there has been no defection of taleban troops seen so far and the taleban are still there .
mazar-e-sharif is still in the taleban 's control despite huge claims of it being captured in a few days time .
anyway if it does happen , there is no way out except to make a government comprising the taleban and the northern alliance , plus any other reasonable minority in afghanistan .
you have to keep in mind that people within the northern alliance have already shared power in the previous government , but failed to control certain areas where they were ruling .
i believe there looks to be no certain future for afghan people in the days ahead .
leave the afghan people to have their own choice , interrupt where necessary .
if they are happy with taleban , give them a go .
aqeel akram , mississauga , canada it would certainly be nice to think afghanistan could move to democracy but the history of trying to move countries to democracy before they are ready for it -lrb- e.g. during de-colonisation in africa -rrb- is n't exactly encouraging .
a more realistic route might be through a constitutional monarchy .
malcolm mcmahon , york , uk once the us-led nato alliance has obtained its measure of vengeance for the september 11 terrorist attacks and terminated the rule of the taleban , along with osama bin laden , there will be a vacuum to fill in terms of who will form the next government of afghanistan .
on one hand there is the northern alliance , described by some experts as an opportunistic group of unsavoury characters , and on the other hand , an aging former king living in exile in italy .
there are several possible exit strategies to this " war on terrorism " that one could imagine , but once the story is off the front pages , will the charitable good samaritan option prevail ?
given the present status of the global economy , would these same countries , including britain , willingly help rebuild this ravaged , war-torn country by underwriting its rebirth for the next decade or two ?
or will they , after assuaging their own populace , allow the afghans to sink back into their old impoverished lifestyle ?

the firm lost 523m euros -lrb- £ 322m ; $ 468m -rrb- in the three months to the end of september , compared with a 371m euro loss in the previous three months .
sales slumped 15 % to just over 1bn euros , and are now at less than half their levels a year ago .
infineon offered little comfort to the sector , saying its forecasts pointed to a 30 % decline this year , with only modest growth in 2002 .
" the market development in the next six months remains uncertain and will be impacted by the slowdown of the world economy and the uncertainty of the current global political environment , " the company said in a statement .
memory problems infineon , the world 's fourth-largest producer of computer memory chips , has been particularly hard hit as prices for dynamic random access memory chips -lrb- dram -rrb- have sunk well below the cost of production .

infineon 's latest results came within the range of analysts ' expectations , which helped its shares gain by 1 % in early trading .
infineon 's shares , which have fallen sharply since the technology-market collapse of mid-2000 , have risen by almost 70 % since 11 september , as investors turned to technology stocks as a safe haven .

ministers are expected to approve a text later on tuesday relating to the world trade organisation 's -lrb- wto -rrb- intellectual property rights accord , known as trips .
the text will state that trips " can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of wto members ' rights to protect public health and in particular to ensure access to medicines for all " .
senior us trade officials said that " great progress " had been made on the health issue , and the success demonstrated to developing countries that the wto was " part of the solution , not part of the problem " .
but they argued the text was a political statement that did not have legal force .
uk trade minister patricia hewitt told the bbc that the deal would " make it easier to get agreement on outstanding issues " .
she also said it was " very helpful that we have achieved a breakthrough early " as the talks aimed at launching a new trade round enter their final day .
different views developing countries had opposed the stance taken by the united states and switzerland on trips .
the developing countries demand the right to override patents and have open access to cheaper generic drugs in times of a health crisis .
many developing countries , such as south africa and brazil , say they can not afford the cost of expensive drugs needed to treat diseases like aids and malaria .
earlier in the year , the us brought a case against brazil to the wto because of its plans to manufacture anti-aids drugs cheaply .
the case was later dropped .
campaigners hail deal oxfam 's ian bray told the bbc that the doha deal was better than anyone could have hoped for a year ago .
however , oxfam expressed disappointment no agreement has been reached on the issue of compulsory licensing in third countries .
this allows countries with no drugs industry to arrange cheap production abroad .
but the pharmaceutical industry expressed concern that the " ambiguity " of the deal could make companies reluctant to engage in aids research .
" it is going to cause a certain amount of confusion among people who read this as to what it actually means , " said international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers associations director general harvey bale .

the deal on cheap access to medicines , which developing countries feel deeply about , will help smooth the way for agreement on other difficult issues .
trade ministers want to start a fresh round of talks to help boost the world trading system at a time when economic growth is faltering and international cooperation has moved up the agenda following the terrorist attacks on the us .
problems still lie ahead on agriculture , where the eu is refusing to agree on the goal of phasing out agriculture subsidies .
there are also difficulties on textiles , where the us may have difficulty in agreeing to accelerate textile and clothing imports from developing countries .

forensic archaeologist professor john hunter of birmingham university , and greater manchester police will use the maps to try to find the body of keith bennett .
the maps were obtained , via an intermediary , by keith bennett 's brother , alan , who has spent 15 years trying to find the missing body .
they appear to point to a different part of the moor to that previously identified by police .
hindley was given a life sentence in 1966 in an emotional interview for the bbc , keith 's mother winnie johnson said : " both me and my family have had 39 years of this .
" keith would be 50 next year .
i mean , he could have had a family of his own .
" you can see how innocent he was . "
police will also re-examine photographs of hindley taken by her partner-in-crime ian brady .
according to hindley , one of the pictures of her kneeling on the ground was taken directly on top of the grave of another victim , john kilbride .
professor hunter said the drawings had helped confirm some of his own investigations .
" i have been out on the moors thinking about where keith might be buried since 1994 . "
torture recordings he said they had managed to narrow down the search area by " re-washing existing information " , looking at aerial photographs and using geophysical survey techniques " we have managed to isolate an area of moorland which we think has a better than 50-50 chance of where keith might be . "
keith bennett would have been 50 next year the search effort has been hampered in part by the shifting of the peat on the moor which has taken place over the last 40 years .
myra hindley and ian brady were given life sentences in 1966 for killings lesley ann downey , 10 , john kilbride , 12 , and edward evans , 17 .
they tape-recorded themselves torturing their victims , whose bodies were buried on saddleworth moor , overlooking manchester .
the pair admitted in the mid-1980s that they had also murdered keith bennett , 12 , and pauline reade , 17 .
pauline reade 's body was found in 1986 but the body of keith bennett has never been found .
hindley , who is in highpoint prison in suffolk , has in the past visited the moor on two occasions to assist police in their search .
the killer has made a number of legal bids for freedom , but has been told by the home secretary , jack straw , she will never be released from prison .

the bbc 's michael osborn met the 30-strong group .
garage outfit so solid crew seem completely chilled out as they get ready to appear on legendary chart show top of the tops .
about 10 of them are crammed inside a tiny dressing room in the bowels of the bbc 's world-famous television centre . click here to watch a clip of so solid crew perform 21 seconds on top of the pops despite topping the british charts with their madly infectious song 21 seconds to go , this collective from south london are anything but your usual musical institution .
for starters , so solid are n't a neatly-moulded group like the spice girls or westlife .
they are a self-made collective of men , women , children - oh , and there 's even a dog in there somewhere .
but as i talk to dj swiss , one of the massive 's more vocal members , it 's clear that so solid 's roots lie at the heart of everything they do .
" we come from a different environment from where you grew up , " says swiss , scrutinising my clipped tones .
oxide and neutrino have had three top ten hits " we 're segregated there , and people do n't really want to know about it . "
this sense of alienation is the message behind the crew 's new single you do n't know , which has given them another top three smash .
" it 's a tune from the heart , " explains swiss .
" it 's says that as much as people want to speculate about who we are and what we do , they do n't really know . "
but does n't mainstream pop success pull you further away from your roots ?
my question causes a rumble of disapproval amongst the crew .
' struggle ' " we 're not here to mess about , we 're here to make music and make our mark that way , " booms swiss 's voice through the murmurs .
" we 've had to struggle for this , and we 've been waiting a long time .
we make ourselves , and we 're here to keep our talent fresh , " he explains to approving nods from the crew 's manager .
the controversy that has recently dogged the crew is left off the agenda - the latest being an incident at the astoria nightclub which left two men with gunshot wounds .
the metropolitan police said no member of the group was involved in the shootings .
but there is a sense that the collective are feeling the pressure of some less than favourable publicity .
' empire ' " england ai n't showing us no love , " murmurs swiss .
but a crew mate chips in to quash recent speculation that they are considering a move abroad .
until now , the driving force behind the so solid ethos has remained quiet .
then mc megaman begins to speak in erudite tones .
" we do n't have much love for the music industry , but we still had to prove ourselves to them , " he explains .
" but we 've grown into an empire and will help other young artists without having to go through the usual channels . "
" there is a lot of talent on the streets .
there are 1,000 more of us from where we come from , " continues megaman .
" our roots is our roots , " he proclaims triumphantly .
identity as the posse prepares to perform on the oldest music show in the world , there is a sense that they are already part of the whole industry they are careful to disown .
but with such a powerful sense of identity , so solid crew may well have the power to stamp their own authority upon the transparent world of pop .
so solid crew 's current single they do n't know is out now on independiente records .
their new album is released on 19 november .
