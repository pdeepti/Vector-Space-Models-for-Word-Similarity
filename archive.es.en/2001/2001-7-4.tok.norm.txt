it is a divergence .
it is not one right decision and one wrong decision eu competition commissioner mario monti honeywell said former chairman lawrence bossidy would replace mr bonsignore with immediate effect .
the eu blocked the deal because of competition fears - but the decision has provoked a furious reaction in the united states , igniting fears of a trade war with europe .
it is the first time a proposed merger between two us companies has been squashed solely by european regulators .
ge chairman and chief executive jack welch has not ruled out an appeal .
" well-meaning " " the commission took a fundamentally different approach to ... its counterparts in the us , canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions , which approved the acquisition with few , if any conditions , " ge said in a statement .
meanwhile , eu competition commissioner mario monti has attempted to heal a potential rift with the us by calling for greater co-operation between the regulators .
he told the financial times that the ge / honeywell decision had been a " rare case " of " well-meaning competition authorities coming to different opinions about the impact of a deal on the global market .
" it is a divergence .
it is not one right decision and one wrong decision . "
although us competition authorities had given their approval to the deal , the commission was worried that the integration of honeywell 's avionics and ge 's strength in jet engines could lead to dominance of the market .
" such integration , unless corrected , could have resulted in the foreclosure of the market for competitors , " mr monti told the bbc .
us backlash ?
the debate as to whether to allow the deal attracted huge interest and sparked fears of a falling-out between the european union and the us .
the eu faced criticism and the threat of retaliatory action from senior us politicians .
and us president george w bush voiced his concern that he wanted the companies to be fairly treated by the eu .
but mr monti said the occasional transatlantic divergence of views was inevitable , and harmless .
" -lsb- the ge-honeywell decision -rsb- was very unusual .
we have a success story of co-ordination in examination of mergers , " he said .
he denied that european protectionism had played a part in tuesday 's decision , stating that the merger had raised concerns among airlines and ge and honeywell rivals on both sides of the atlantic .
airbus , the european aerospace consortium , was not a plaintiff , he said .
' profound regret ' general electric , which during negotiations last month accused the ec of making " extraordinary demands " , said it was " deeply disappointed " by tuesday 's decision .
" we strongly disagree with the commission 's conclusions about the competitive effects of ge 's acquisition of honeywell , " the firm said in a statement .
" the facts just do n't support these assertions .
we believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality , service and prices . "
ge and honeywell twice last month offered the commission concessions in last ditch efforts to get the deal approved .
life after the merger ge chairman jack welch postponed his retirement to continue working on the deal but is now expected to depart swiftly .
the idea is to stay independent now , to get the company back up on its feet honeywell chairman lawrence bossidy the fate of the two companies has differed greatly during the nine-month waiting period .
ge remains a healthy company with or without honeywell .
it announced a 16 % rise in full year profits in april , and its share price has tended to rise on speculation that the deal will be blocked .
" ge remains confident that 2001 , with or without honeywell , will be another record year of double digit operating earnings growth , " said the firm in a statement .
honeywell , however , reported a dramatic slump in annual profits of 92 % in april and was forced to cut 6,500 jobs .
and the firm partially blamed the proposed merger for its demise , saying that it had delayed selling underperforming business units that it had previously planned to ditch .
on wall street , ge shares closed ahead of the 4 july holiday $ 0.80 lower at $ 49.40 .
honeywell ended $ 0.99 higher at $ 35.20 , with investors said to be warming to the prospect of mr bonsignore 's resignation .
mr bossidy , who has signed on with a one-year commitment , said he intended to keep honeywell independent , despite analysts ' expectations that ge rivals would step in to bid for the company .
mr bossidy said : " the idea is to stay independent now , to get the company back up on its feet , to get the people reengaged and obviously at some point in the future the company may reconsider it again , " he said , regarding other merger possibilities .
" but it 's not the intention of the board to have any considerations right now . "

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- ukraine edges onto world stage low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 4 july , 2001 , 06:04 gmt 07:04 uk ukraine edges onto world stage macedonia will be top of the nato chief 's agenda by stephen dalziel the nato secretary-general , lord robertson , visits the ukrainian capital , kiev , on wednesday for talks with the country 's president leonid kuchma .
the situation in macedonia will be top of their agenda .
but the two men are also likely to discuss the wider question of relations between ukraine and nato .
president kuchma wants to show that ukraine matters internationally ukraine has been an active participant in nato 's partnership for peace programme .
and president kuchma will see the visit of lord robertson as another step in what is beginning to look like an extraordinary personal political rehabilitation .
after surviving months of turmoil , and mass protests over his alleged involvement in the murder of a journalist , last month mr kuchma took full advantage of the visit of pope john paul ii to underline his place as the leader of one of europe 's largest countries .
now mr kuchma can use lord robertson 's presence in kiev to show again that ukraine matters in international affairs .
ukraine sailors make up part of the black sea fleet he knows , too , that he is on safe ground .
while there are serious doubts about ukraine 's commitment to political and economic reform , nato has welcomed the enthusiasm with which the former soviet republic has embraced its partnership for peace programme .
this will be highlighted again when the 10-day sea breeze 2001 military exercise begins around the ukrainian port of odessa on friday , involving nine nato members and four countries with black sea coasts : bulgaria , georgia , romania and ukraine .
world stage lord robertson will also discuss nato-ukrainian co-operation in macedonia .
ukraine has already supplied military equipment to the macedonian government in its struggle with albanian separatists .
but for mr kuchma , the substance of the talks with the nato secretary-general is less important than the very fact that yet again he is hosting an important figure on the world stage .

in a letter to welsh finance minister edwina hart , lord richard rogers says the project has been " bedevilled " by officials ' attempts to disguise the true costs of changes to the design .
lord rogers also warns that the future of the project is seriously threatened .
in the letter which has been leaked to bbc wales , lord rogers , designer of the millennium dome and paris 's pompidou centre , says he believes his company is getting the blame for the consequences of the increased costs .
this is unacceptable , he tells mrs hart .
the cost of building a new chamber for the assembly has risen dramatically from the Â£ 17m estimated when the body was voted for four years ago .
last november the auditor general for wales sir john bourn warned that the final cost of setting up the national assembly could reach Â£ 41m - a 123 % increase on the original estimate. n a highly critical report , sir john said there was no fixed budget and no monitoring at a senior level of the costs of converting crickhowell house in cardiff bay to be the assembly 's temporary home .
he said that some costs were grossly understated .
now lord rogers has added his voice of concern , saying the project has been bedevilled by assembly officials ' continuous attempts to disguise the true costs of design changes .
he criticises additional requirements , changes to the design , and the political will to use indigenous materials , at any cost as well as a procurement process that is highly inflexible , adversarial and divisive , he says all this has discouraged competitive bidding , and has failed to make use of the design team 's extensive experience in ensuring value for money .
approved budget he says the project is seriously threatened , and recommends an urgent and comprehensive review , to ensure optimum value to the taxpayer .
he warns the finance minister that appropriate procurement procedures must be put in place , if the building is to stay within two point five per cent of the approved budget of just over Â£ 13m .
it is the second time the eminent architect has voiced his concerns about the stalled project .
last year he called for the approval on the new chamber to be speeded up after first minister rhodri morgan decided to review all the options for the siting and costs of the new building .
then lord rogers expressed his wish that the building debate did not become a " political football " .
a spokesman for the national assembly said " the finance minister will be reporting the position on costs to the assembly before the recess .
