there is only one path to resolve our problems - spend only what we collect in taxes domingo cavallo economy minister argentina shares slid by more than 13 % shortly after the start of trading on thursday , as the nation 's financial crisis escalates , although a late rally left the merval down just over 8 % on the day .
speaking after a surprise cabinet meeting called by president fernando de la rua , mr cavallo said his austerity plan was the only alternative to " returning to an absolutely disorganised , unjust economy " .
meanwhile the united states and the international monetary fund have indicated they had no plans to grant additional funds to help south america 's third largest economy .
the merval index of leading shares fell to its lowest level since march 1995 when the government 's latest package of economic measures was not well received by the markets .
and the gloomy mood was compounded when the credit agency standard and poor 's cut the country 's credit rating to ' b ' minus .
despite the austerity plan , fears are still growing that three years of economic stagnation could leave the country without the funds to pay its $ 128bn debt .
' no devaluation ' the debt mountain is equal to almost half of the country 's gross domestic product .
mr cavallo announced on wednesday that the government intended to reduce all government spending , including pension payments and salaries .
in an address on national television , mr cavallo said : " there is only one path to resolve our problems - spend only what we collect in taxes . "
mr cavallo also tried to soothe the currency markets , saying " there wo n't be devaluations ... we will defend at all costs the stability of the peso and the financial system . "
but the markets remained unconvinced , and opposition parties dismissed the planned changes , with one deputy branding the reforms as " totally recessive " .
and members of the ruling alliance issued a statement to the government urging it to seek broad agreement with other political forces to quell the economic crisis .
knock-on effect the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- warned on thursday of the knock-on effect on growth prospects for emerging markets around the world .
" market participants widely believe that a crisis in argentina would lead to much reduced capital flows to emerging markets and thereby would reduce their growth prospects , " the imf said in its 2001 international capital markets report .
we will defend at all costs stability of the peso and the financial system domingo cavallo investors worldwide , remembering how the so-called asian crisis swept through markets in the late 1990s , have already been scrutinising the plight of emerging economies in the current period of global economic slowdown .
the fallout from argentina 's financial crisis has already spread through the americas and across the atlantic .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- algeria opposes un western sahara plan low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : africa front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 13 july , 2001 , 05:08 gmt 06:08 uk algeria opposes un western sahara plan mr bouteflika : the plan favours morocco by diplomatic correspondent barnaby mason algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika has met president george w bush and his secretary of state , colin powell , in washington .
energy co-operation and political and economic reform in algeria were high on the agenda , but the discussions were also expected to cover united nations proposals for the disputed territory of western sahara .
mr baker has been seeking an agreement for four years since 1991 , when a ceasefire ended the fighting in western sahara between moroccan troops and guerrillas of the polisario front , the un has been trying to get the two sides to agree on arrangements for a referendum to decide the future of the territory .
for the last four years , un special envoy james baker , a former us secretary of state , has been trying to break the deadlock over who should be allowed to vote .
solution ' impossible ' polisario maintains that the referendum should be limited to the 74,000 people counted in the census of 1974 , when western sahara was still a spanish colony .
morocco says many more are entitled to take part , including more recent arrivals .
neither side will give way , since both believe the size and make-up of the electorate will determine whether the territory is ruled by morocco or becomes independent .
mr baker has now concluded that reaching agreement is virtually impossible .
the un secretary-general , kofi annan , endorsed that view in a report to the security council at the end of june .
alternative autonomy plan the security council , in turn , urged the parties to discuss an alternative : mr baker 's autonomy plan .
this came as a bombshell to polisario and its backers .
although western sahara would have internal self-government , with responsibility for the key sectors of phosphate mining and fishing , morocco would control national security as well as foreign affairs and defence , including everything relating to weapons and explosives .
most controversially , there would be a referendum on the status of the territory within five years , and everyone having lived there for at least a year would be entitled to vote .
that could include large numbers of settlers from elsewhere in morocco .
' plan deprives sahrawi ' the reaction from algeria came in a memorandum from mr bouteflika to mr annan only recently made public .
the algerian president says such a referendum would be open to every kind of manipulation and deprive the sahrawi people of their right to self-determination .
in general , he says , the draft plan favours only one approach : the integration of western sahara into morocco .
it confirms the illegal occupation of the territory in violation of previous un resolutions .
the new approach certainly amounts to a drastic about-turn .
the big powers are tired of the deadlock , and if no agreement is possible on autonomy they are likely to walk away from the problem altogether .
the moroccans would have the most to gain from that .

former russian defence minister igor sergeyev called us consultations with allies and with moscow a " smokescreen " to cover a decision that had already been taken , the russian news agency ria reported .
but mr sergeyev - now a top security advisor to russian president vladimir putin - said russia would not panic or " beg the united states to stick to the anti-ballistic missile treaty " .
us deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz told the senate that the bush administration expected to " bump up " against the abm treaty , which puts severe limits on systems like the one the us is considering , " in months rather than years " .
seeking agreement but he added that washington was aiming to reach an agreement with russia to avoid breaching the 1972 treaty , allowing both countries to " move beyond it " .
george w bush 's national security advisor , condoleezza rice , said mr bush would raise the issue again with mr putin on the sidelines of a summit in italy later this month .
missile defence has been brought into sharp focus by a test planned for saturday - the first since mr bush took office .
previous tests have ended in failure .
a us arms control expert said saturday 's test would prove critical to mr bush .
key test " if this test fails , it will have a major impact on the credibility of the us president , " said joseph cirincone of the carnegie endowment for peace .
they have spent a long time doing everything possible to make this a successful test joseph cirincone , arms control expert he said that the test had been designed to be as easy as possible .
" they have spent a long time doing everything possible to make this a successful test .
they should be able to do this , " he said .
the bbc defence correspondent , jonathan marcus , says that despite washington 's decision to press ahead with the scheme , the political , diplomatic and technical hurdles remain immense .
democratic scepticism key democrats are sceptical of the project and are urging a cautious approach to research and testing - a view shared , according to opinion polls by a majority of ordinary americans .
if saturday 's test is not successful , democrats will have a powerful position from which to fight the pentagon 's request for a 57 % increase in the programme 's budget , to $ 8.3 billion for 2002 .
preliminary work on a new test facility at fort greely in alaska could begin as early as next month .
the eventual aim is to base a small number of interceptor missiles there .
by 2004 , the americans also want to upgrade an important radar installation on shemya island in alaska , and officials believe that a rudimentary missile defence system could be operational by 2005 .
the new test site would enable test launches of dummy missiles with flight paths towards the united states .
this would provide a realistic target .
if tests are successful , fort greely could provide an interim - albeit limited - defensive capability .

but last week , guerrillas bombed the 775km -lrb- 485 mile -rrb- long oil pipeline operated by us-based occidental petroleum corporation .
this year alone there have been more than 100 attacks .
the bogota daily el tiempo says rebel attacks on the pipeline have cost the country $ 340m in lost revenue .
the guerrillas are fighting against what they perceive to be foreign dominance of the colombian oil industry .
but no-one has been hit harder than the population of arauca .
two rebel groups are fighting for control of the oil fields today the region is facing the worst financial crisis in its history .
governor hector federico gallardo told caracol radio that all investment in infrastructure and social programmes had been suspended .
one of two operating theatres in the main hospital , san vicente , is about to close .
nearly 1,000 teachers paid by the arauca governor 's office are owed two months ' back pay .
one hundred doctors have been waiting three months for their wages .
shops have suffered too .
thousands are on the verge of closing down as a result of a guerrilla ban on the sale of beer , soft drinks and bottled water .
distribution stopped in may , because the suppliers - including coca-cola - refused to pay the rebels protection money .
after oil royalties , tax on beer consumption is the region 's main source of revenue .
paralysed last week , the governor appealed for help .
" it has been 15 years since the government invested one single peso in social development , because it left everything to the royalties " , he said .
more troops are needed to guarantee security in the region " there has been no oil production , and the department has been paralysed for five months , besieged by a war in which civilians continue to suffer . "
a special security council meeting was recently held to resolve the crisis .
a government commission led by vice-president gustavo bell heard that if help was not forthcoming , 300,000 people faced the collapse of public services .
oil companies are calling on the government to guarantee security in the region .
still committed in an interview in el tiempo , the president of occidental petroleum in colombia , jose guimer dominguez , gave assurances the company was still committed to colombia .
" we have been there for the good times and we are not thinking about abandoning it in the bad times , " he said .
but he added that rebel attacks on the pipeline had led to the suspension of more than 500 workers ' contracts pending guarantees for continuous production .
for the time being , the company would make no further investments in other colombian oil projects .

the rocket was carrying the experimental artemis communications satellite and a japanese satellite for direct broadcast television .
arianespace president jean-marie luton said an investigation into the failure had already begun .
preliminary results were expected on friday .
we did not reach the desired orbit - we apologise to our clients jean-marie luton , arianespace european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- experts said there was a possibility the satellites could be salvaged , but that firing their reignitable engines could shorten their lifespan .
the artemis satellite has two engines , while the japanese bsat-2b television orbiter has only one .
full apology arianespace president luton apologised to clients for the failure to reach proper orbit .
the $ 850m artemis satellite was partially insured .
bsat-2b officials were not available to comment .
the satellite was meant to orbit 36,000 km above the earth the ariane programme , which began in 1979 , has a good record .
only eight of its 141 missions have ended in failure - the most spectacular being the ariane 5 's maiden test-flight in 1996 .
the vehicle was destroyed 37 seconds after launch as it veered off course .
the latest failure is considered unlikely to affect ariane 's full order book .
thursday launch from europe 's space port in kourou , french guiana , went well at first .
the artemis payload was aiming for a final geostationary orbit at 21.5 degrees east over central africa , about 36,000km -lrb- 22,300 miles -rrb- above the ground .
at present , its orbit is only reaching a maximum of 17,500km -lrb- 10,940 miles -rrb- .
most advanced artemis is the most advanced telecommunications satellite yet developed by esa and its partners .
it will act as a demonstrator for new technologies .
artemis is a demonstrator for future space technologies the multi-purpose satellite is designed to conduct trials of europe 's proposed satellite navigation system , which esa claims will be more accurate and more reliable than the american global positioning system .
it is also meant to demonstrate new mobile communication technologies that should eventually make telephone conversations possible via satellite anywhere in europe , north africa or the near east - even at sea .
its system of propulsion , which uses ionised xenon as the propellant , should make future satellites more compact .
it is also intended to test direct satellite-to-satellite communications , including a revolutionary laser link that is so accurate the light pulses can hit a target the size of a coin at 10km -lrb- six miles -rrb- .
the link is expected to replace conventional earthbound relay systems , and should dramatically improve the time it takes for satellites to pass data between each other and their terrestrial base stations .
earth observation satellites should send down their pictures of the planet much faster , for example .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- gene linked to heart disease risk low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's daniel sandford " the advise from doctors to all smokers is still give it up " real 56k professor steve humphries , university college london explains the results of his study real 56k friday , 13 july , 2001 , 07:10 gmt 08:10 uk gene linked to heart disease risk male smokers with the gene variant are at increased risk scientists have discovered a gene which increases smokers ' risk of developing coronary heart disease by up to four times .
around a quarter of the population carries one or more copies of the key gene variant .
but researchers say genetic tests to warn who is at risk will not be commercially available until further studies have confirmed their findings .
smokers are known to have an increased risk of developing heart disease , because smoking increases the risk of blood clots and blocked arteries .
men who carried the e4 type are at higher risk of heart disease , but only if they are smokers professor steve humphries , university college london but this study may explain why some smokers get heart disease while others get lung cancer or bronchial problems .
and heart health experts say they hope the information will help motivate smokers to stop .
the gene which has been studied is apo-e which produces a protein and helps control levels of fats in the blood .
there are three variations , e2 , e3 and e4 .
e4 is the variant linked to highest risk .
risk factors everyone has two copies of the gene , one from their mother and one from their father .
professor steve humphries warned against smoking scientists in this study found risk was increased just by having one e4 variant .
they speculate people with two e4 copies would be at increased risk .
researchers from university college london -lrb- ucl -rrb- and the wolfson institute at st bartholomew 's hospital tracked the heart health of over 3,000 men aged between 50 and 61 over eight years .
all had checks to assess their cholesterol levels and other heart disease risk factors .
dna techniques were used to identify which type of the gene the men had .
current smokers had double the risk of having a heart problem than those who had never smoked .
but men who smoked and had the e4 variant had a three-fold risk compared to those who had never smoked , when the risk factor of the gene was considered on its own .
when taken along with other risk factors such as obesity , the increased risk was nearly four times as high .
but e4 variant smokers who quit see their risk reduced to roughly the levels of non-smokers , say the scientists .
e4 had previously been recognised as a risk factor for coronary heart disease .
this research confirms the link and extends the findings to a younger age group .
antioxidants steve humphries , british heart foundation professor of cardiovascular genetics at ucl , said : " men who carried the e4 type are at higher risk of heart disease , but only if they are smokers " .
artery walls are damaged by chemicals from tobacco smoke which make holes in the wall lining , and damage ldl , the " bad " form of cholesterol .
the damaged ldl particles enter the holes and accumulate on the artery walls .
that triggers an immune response in the body and attracts large numbers of white blood cells to the site .
that causes plaque to form , which can block the artery and lead to blood clots .
apo-e is thought to stop the damage being done to the cholesterol , but with varying degrees of effectiveness .
professor humphries said : " e2 is best at this , e3 is not so good , and e4 is downright terrible . "
professor george miller of the wolfson institute , who also worked on the study , said : " there is no test widely available for this gene , and even if there were , doctors can not treat you for having a gene . "
sir charles george , medical director of the british heart foundation , said : " i hope the information gained in this study will help to motivate the many smokers who want to quit . "
more studies will now be carried out , looking at the gene 's effect on women , and seeing if this first study 's results are replicated .

but men who smoked and had the e4 variant had a three-fold risk compared to those who had never smoked , when the risk factor of the gene was considered on its own .
when taken along with other risk factors such as obesity , the increased risk was nearly four times as high .
but e4 variant smokers who quit see their risk reduced to roughly the levels of non-smokers , say the scientists .
e4 had previously been recognised as a risk factor for coronary heart disease .
this research confirms the link and extends the findings to a younger age group .
antioxidants steve humphries , british heart foundation professor of cardiovascular genetics at ucl , said : " men who carried the e4 type are at higher risk of heart disease , but only if they are smokers " .
artery walls are damaged by chemicals from tobacco smoke which make holes in the wall lining , and damage ldl , the " bad " form of cholesterol .
the damaged ldl particles enter the holes and accumulate on the artery walls .
that triggers an immune response in the body and attracts large numbers of white blood cells to the site .
that causes plaque to form , which can block the artery and lead to blood clots .
apo-e is thought to stop the damage being done to the cholesterol , but with varying degrees of effectiveness .
professor humphries said : " e2 is best at this , e3 is not so good , and e4 is downright terrible . "
professor george miller of the wolfson institute , who also worked on the study , said : " there is no test widely available for this gene , and even if there were , doctors can not treat you for having a gene . "
sir charles george , medical director of the british heart foundation , said : " i hope the information gained in this study will help to motivate the many smokers who want to quit . "
more studies will now be carried out , looking at the gene 's effect on women , and seeing if this first study 's results are replicated .

bosses at the mean fiddler empire , which has grown from a single club in north london in 1982 into an international concern , have said they will launch the channel within two years .
" the directors believe that interactive tv represents the logical conclusion to the convergence of technologies and the future for digital broadcasts , " a statement on friday said .
the channel would allow the empire , which attracts more than 2 million customers to its events and venues , to exploit further its music festival operations .
stock market listing the plans were revealed in a document detailing plans to merge the mean fiddler holdings , the festivals and venue business , with its sister firm meanfiddler.com , which runs internet and rights operations .
while meanfiddler.com has been listed on london 's small-company aim market since may last year , the rest of the empire has remained in private hands - notably those of founder vince power .
mr power , a former demolition worker and second-hand furniture salesman , still owns more than one-third of mean fiddler holdings , and stands to make more than Â£ 10m from the listing .

the very fact that eight families now live in the haveli , or mansion , occupied by only the musharraf family indicates that they belonged to the muslim elite of old delhi .
it 's our tradition to do the utmost in hospitality local councillor , shoaib iqbal when he visited the house on saturday afternoon , the first day of his trip to india , he was unlikely to have recognised it .
it has changed enormously since his family left for pakistan after partition , when he was just four years old .
in fact , the present occupants had no idea that general musharraf 's parents had been the original owners until he assumed power in pakistan and the bbc broadcast an interview in which he casually mentioned that he recalled the house , known as neharwali haveli -lrb- house by the canal -rrb- .
the two owners of the main portions of the haveli competed host the president for tea .
as part of the welcome , they presented him with the original title deeds .

sir syed ahmed , the greatest reformer of muslim education , lived next door to general musharraf 's family .
now it is a fantastically-congested ghetto , inhabited largely by poor muslims with only a sprinkling of hindus , although it still retains some of its old , oriental charm .
the immediate area around the musharraf family 's haveli is an ugly , crowded cluster of narrow alleyways .
cloaked in security a massive spring clean has been under way for weeks .
the local councillor , shoaib iqbal , has been masterminding the facelift .
security precautions have been extensive " it 's our tradition to do the utmost in hospitality and that means making sure everything is immaculate for our guests , " he said .
the disruption has caused considerable inconvenience to the local residents but they appear not to mind .
anil jain , who lives in part of the haveli , said : " as long as it leads to better relations with pakistan , we do not mind one bit . "
certainly , the security precautions were extensive , particularly because of the narrow lanes .
in fact , the haveli was cordoned off totally by a huge white protective screen .
the area around the haveli was deserted when general musharraf paid his 40-minute visit .
the local residents were told to remain indoors and ordered not even to open their windows as a security precaution .
their only experience of the visit was the sound of his motorcade arriving , the banging of car doors and security officials talking on their walkie-talkies .
but they were able to enjoy one event .

figures published on friday show that since 1 april , 2001 , 2,670 nursing staff have returned to the nhs , are on refresher courses , or waiting to take up posts .
but , as of march this year , there were 9,020 posts that had been vacant in england for longer than three months .
that is a fall of 0.5 % compared to the march 2000 figure .
health secretary alan milburn said : " the vacancy survey published today show that we have got a long way to go but we are clearly turning the corner on nurse and midwife recruitment . "
there are also 670 hospital consultants jobs vacant - up 0.2 % on last year 's figures .
in professions such as radiologists , physiotherapists and laboratory technicians , the vacancy rate rose by just under 1 % .
the government has pledged to recruit 20,000 nurses by 2004 .
the department of health said some returners cited the introduction of family-friendly policies as the reason for their return .
it claims the abolition of two thirds of health authorities will mean Â£ 100m will be available for childcare facilities for nhs staff in the future .
free refresher courses and one-off lump-sums of at least Â£ 1,000 had also attracted nurses and midwives back , it said .
' 110,000 needed ' figures from the department show that since february 1999 , 8,226 nurses , midwives and health visitors have returned to the nhs .
they are coming in the front door , but we have got to make sure they do n't fall out the back door beverly malone government statistics also reveal there are 17,100 extra nurses in the nhs , compared to 1997 - where september to september figures are matched .
in december last year , an independent study commissioned by the royal college of nursing , suggested that because of the numbers who would leave the profession , 110,000 new recruits will be needed to meet the 2004 target .
the rcn report also found a nationwide shortage of 22,000 nurses , midwives and health visitors .
it said if retirement and other losses stay at their current rates , 90,000 nurses will have left by 2004 .
that , together with 20,000 planned extra recruits , means the nhs will actually need to fill in excess of 110,000 vacancies .
retention issues royal college of nursing general secretary beverly malone told the bbc she was delighted that nurses were returning to the profession .
however she warned that efforts must be made to persuade those currently working in the nhs not to quit .
we have got a long way to go but we are clearly turning the corner on nurse and midwife recruitment health secretary alan milburn she said : " they are coming in the front door , but we have got to make sure they do n't fall out the back door . "
this could only be done by improving the pay and working conditions for nurses , she said .
" we need to pay nurses adequately , and reward them and value them .
" the working conditions play a big part also .
nurses have to have the right equipment , they have to have enough staff , and they have to have a management system that supports their ability to give safe , quality care to patients . "
dr evan harris , liberal democrat shadow health secretary , said , at the current rate , it would take more than ten years to fill all medical and dental vacancies in the nhs .
the nurse recruitment campaign , involving tv , radio and press advertisements , ran from february to march this year .
local recruitment drives also took place .

squads from the elite police mobile squad arrived at the home of police general suroyo bimantoro at sunset on thursday .
they said they had been ordered to protect general bimantoro 's home from any threat .

troops were also reported to be protecting the home of jakarta police chief , major general sofyan yacob .
president wahid has accused both men of plotting against him and planning his detention ahead of impeachment proceedings that are due to start next month .
