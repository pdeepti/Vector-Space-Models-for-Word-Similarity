we have a solemn obligation to make sure that the case has been handled in full accordance ... with our constitution george w bush he said the very foundations of the country 's democracy depended on its ability to assure its citizens that they would be treated fairly under us law .
the us attorney-general announced on friday that mcveigh 's execution would be delayed by a month after it emerged that thousands of documents had been mistakenly withheld from mcveigh 's defence lawyers by the fbi .
mcveigh was originally scheduled to die by lethal injection next wednesday in a high-profile execution which has been eagerly awaited by some of the victims of the bombing .
president bush said he understood that people would be frustrated by the delay .
but he added : " any time we are preparing to carry out the death penalty , we have a solemn obligation to make sure that the case has been handled in full accordance with all the guarantees of our constitution . "
mcveigh was , mr bush said , lucky to be born an american .
the president said he was sure of mcveigh 's guilt but did not want the government " rushing his fate " .
one of mcveigh 's lawyers , rob nigh , said his client might decide to fight the execution order in the light of the developments .
" he is distressed about this , " said mr nigh .
timothy mcveigh born to working-class catholic parents in a buffalo suburb decorated gulf war veteran developed a passion for gun ownership and a hate for the federal government motivated by right-wing novel the turner diaries , which features deadly assault on an fbi hq before thursday 's dramatic developments , mcveigh had declined to appeal against his conviction .
attorney-general john ashcroft said that mcveigh , by his own admission , was guilty and the newly disclosed evidence did not contradict the jury 's verdict .
the bbc washington correspondent says the postponement is probably more a matter of ensuring that justice is seen to be done than a signal that the case against mcveigh will unwind .
mr ashcroft has also asked the justice department to investigate why the fbi failed to hand over the 3,135 documents from 46 of its offices , which include interview notes , photographs , written correspondence and tapes .
there is no doubt in my mind ... about the guilt of timothy mcveigh attorney general john ashcroft president bush admitted he was " concerned " about the bungle , but stressed his confidence in the us justice system .
" i think by and large the system is healthy , and i think today proved why it is healthy , " he said .
the us justice department issued a statement saying it was " confident the documents do not in any way create any reasonable doubt about mcveigh 's guilt , and do not contradict his repeated confessions of guilt " .
if the defence does choose to act , it will have to file a motion to consider new evidence .
the appeals court can only grant this motion if it determines that the evidence might have changed the jury 's verdict .
survivors of the blast and the victims ' relatives have expressed outrage at the delay .
the 1995 bombing of a federal building in oklahoma city , in which 168 people were killed and hundreds injured , was the worst ever such atrocity on american soil .

the dismantling of the ring began with a severe embarrassment for the colombian government when some seven months ago the son of the head of the country 's drug crop substitution programme was arrested with a friend in miami .
the two of them were caught with nearly seven kilogrammes -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- of heroin strapped to their legs under baggy trousers .
andres lafaurie-restrepo , then 19 years old , apparently co-operated fully with the us authorities and helped launch an investigation that resulted in the arrest of 40 people - 24 in colombia and 16 in the us .
authorities estimate the ring had smuggled up to a ton of heroin into the united states , mainly using upper-class colombians with long-established us visas to divert suspicion .
colombia now exports every year nine tons of heroin along with 600 tons of cocaine .
colombia is well known for its cocaine , of which it exports over 80 % of the world total , but in recent years the drug traffickers have diversified into heroin , worth much more per kilo than cocaine .
so colombia has quickly become the main supplier of both drugs to the us , producing a heroin of unsurpassed purity which need not be injected but can be smoked or snorted , removing much of the stigma associated with the drug .
authorities estimate that colombia now exports every year nine tons of heroin along with 600 tons of cocaine .

the dismantling of the ring began with a severe embarrassment for the colombian government when some seven months ago the son of the head of the country 's drug crop substitution programme was arrested with a friend in miami .

the soap will be based around the lives , loves , triumphs and disasters of a group of eight characters .
each episode will stretch across three sms messages .
the idea is already on trial in germany and its inventors are now talking to british tv companies to develop the soap and the update service further .
leading the way with this new form of episodic entertainment is technology company materna , which has signed a deal with german mobile phone firm e-plus the drama , simply called sms-soap , revolves around the lives of eight individuals - called laura , franziska , judith , inka , tim , mirko , jan , and ulf - who all work at an advertising agency owned by tim .
michael ohajuru , a spokesman for materna , said three messages were needed for each episode because the 160-character limit of one sms message would not allow the story to develop enough .
" the only downside of sms is its brevity , " he said .
mr ohajuru added that many mobile phone networks allowed up to three messages to be linked together as a single " event " for which the customer was charged the price of only one message .
the sms-soap will be free until the end of may when e-plus will start charging 39 pfennigs -lrb- 12p -rrb- for each episode .
a weekly summary of events in the soap will be posted on the e-plus website every sunday .
mr ohajuru said materna was currently negotiating with the makers of soaps in the uk and expected a similar service to launch in britain soon .
