i hope that no one else ever has to go through the same sort of thing again julie bower she was given a £ 25,000 bonus for 1998 , while some male co-workers received up to £ 1.5m.
mrs bower , from pimlico , central london , won her claim of unfair dismissal and two claims of sexual discrimination in relation to both her dismissal and the bonus .
but the tribunal rejected two further claims of sex discrimination , and an equal pay claim that she should also have been paid a £ 1.5m bonus .
the company had said this bonus was only arranged to stop ssl workers who had been approached by other companies from being " poached " .
the tribunal ruled that the firm 's attitude over pay had forced the mother-of-one to resign .
' threatening and sarcastic ' it concluded that her £ 25,000 bonus did not reflect the market rate or represent a genuine valuation of her performance , but was " calculated and intended to give her the message that she was not valued or wanted " .

mrs bower , who was also told by chairman philip augar to go on a relationship skills course , resigned in october 1999 .
speaking after the tribunal decision , mrs bower said : " the way in which schroder dealt with my complaints about the way i was treated was completely unacceptable and i hope that no one else ever has to go through the same sort of thing again . "
the equal opportunities commission , which backed mrs bower 's case , said the culture at ssl made discrimination all too easy to occur .
jenny watson , deputy chairman of the commission , said : " i hope employers will take notice of the lessons to be learned from this case .
equal opportunities are not an optional extra and there is no case , as is sometimes claimed , for the city to ' do things differently ' . "

mr zuma is reported to have held separate meetings with the congolese president , joseph kabila , and a delegation of the burundian forces for the defence of democracy -lrb- fdd -rrb- , headed by its leader jean-bosco ndayikengurukiye .
another burundian rebel group , the national liberation forces , had been expected to attend but reports did not confirm whether the rebel group attended .
the talks coincided with fighting between army and fdd near the country 's second city , gitega .
inclusion of rebels none of the participants commented on the meetings , but the talks in kinshasa are said to have been aimed at bringing rebel groups more fully into peace negotiations .
earlier this year , congolese and burundian authorities agreed to settle their differences after the two sides accused each other of backing rebels fighting the other .
for eight years there has been a civil war in burundi between the hutu majority and the mainly tutsi army , resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 people .
and the country 's troops are also said to have operated across the border in congo , where both burundian and rwandan hutus have bases .
