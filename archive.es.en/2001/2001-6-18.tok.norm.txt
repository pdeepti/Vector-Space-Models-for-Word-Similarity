the former monarch has promised to revive his impoverished country 's fortunes born into the royal house of saxe-coburg and related to britain 's queen elizabeth ii , the 64-year-old bearded ex-monarch has promised to revive his impoverished country 's fortunes .
other former monarchs from eastern europe have returned to their homelands since the collapse of communism 11 years ago , but simeon is the first to regain political power .
simeon became king at the age of six during world war ii , in which bulgaria supported nazi germany .

simeon has been able to play on his credentials as never forgetting his roots he married a spanish aristocrat , and , keen to hold onto his heritage , gave his five children bulgarian names .
he speaks several languages , including bulgarian peppered with out-of-date vocabulary kept during his long exile .
his own name was taboo in communist bulgaria , but not forgotten .

' cry for help ' simeon has been able to play on his credentials as both the bulgarian who never abandoned his roots and an outsider untainted by the country 's politics of the last 50 years .
he has stressed how he closely watched bulgaria from afar .
" during this period there was nothing more hurtful , for me , than the cry for help of hundreds of my countrymen who had been living on the border of human existence .

the chicks are being moved as part of a five-year project to establish a breeding population in county donegal .
the golden eagle , which is a protected species in the uk , has not been found breeding in ireland for nearly a century .
collection of the birds , aged between five and six weeks , will start within the next few days and the first 12 will be moved across the irish sea before the end of the month .
golden eagles normally lay two eggs , but the elder chick often kills the younger one .
tracking plans for the irish transfer , only one will be removed from each specially-selected nest in a large area so that numbers in scotland are not affected .
when they arrive in donegal they will be held captive for six weeks before being released .
they will be fitted with small radio transmitters before they are freed so they can be tracked .
the initiative which was originally conceived in 1989 is being part-funded by the irish government .
official approval for the scheme had to be given in scotland because the golden eagle is a protected species under the wildlife and countryside act 1981 .

scientists in manchester have been working on preserving the 3,500 year old remains , nicknamed brymbo man .
the preservation work has included recreating his skeleton and features .
now final preparations are under way for brymbo man to go on display at wrexham town museum .
the early bronze age discovery was made in the village of the same name in 1958 and is considered to be one of wales 's most important archaeological finds .
the remains were uncovered by a workman digging a trench .
brymbo man was found still in his burial chamber and with a flint knife at his side .
reconstruction with the aid of modern scientific techniques , experts at manchester university have reconstructed his skull and face .
little is known about his origins , but painstaking reconstruction work has revealed he stood 5ft 7ins tall , was about 40 years of age and was right-handed .
the launch of the new exhibit will be attended by children from brymbo school and relatives of ron pritchard , one of the workers who found the burial site 43 years ago .

the area is thought to have been the scene of fierce inter-tribal battles during the bronze age and the caves could have been used as a refuge from conflict .
