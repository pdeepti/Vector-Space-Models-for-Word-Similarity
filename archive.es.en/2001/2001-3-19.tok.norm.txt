the portman group , which promotes sensible drinking , warns of the dangers of too much alcohol and urges drinkers to cut back before they land themselves in danger .
the posters " if you do do drink , do n't do drunk , " target 18-24 year olds and warns them of the risks they face by excessive drinking .
when drunk people lose inhibitions they can be more aggressive than usual , ending up in trouble with the law ; injured in a hospital 's casualty department or vulnerable to attack .
enjoy a drink , no problem .
but getting drunk should be as socially unacceptable as drink-driving jean coussins , director of the portman group it is estimated that one in six people attending accident and emergency have alcohol related injuries or problems .
jean coussins , director of the portman group , said that one million young adults are drinking regularly simply to get drunk .
one of the new posters warning of the perils of too much drink putting the posters in pubs , bars , casualty wards , public transport and university campuses , they hope to change the image of a drunken britain .
ms coussins said : " this campaign is the start of a long haul to change the image of drunkenness and the culture of excess around alcohol in britain .
" enjoy a drink , no problem .
but getting drunk should be as socially unacceptable as drink-driving . "
cutting crime health minister gisela stuart welcomed the campaign and stressed that cutting drunkenness will lead to a cut in crime and injuries .
" drunkenness poses many problems : accidents , violent crime , unprotected sex and ill-health when drinkers go too far .
" this campaign 's message is an important one .
it recognises that consumers have a choice between sensible drinking and drunkenness , and addresses a number of serious issues which have adverse effects every day on the lives of a huge number of people . "
another of portman group posters rob hayward , chief executive of the brewers and licensed retailers association , said it is important to convince drinkers of the difference between having a drink and getting drunk .
" convincing young people that a good night out does not need to be fuelled by excessive drinking that can lead to dangerous and damaging behaviour is key to developing a more sensible drinking culture in britain . "
rob taylor , assistant chief constable of greater manchester police , said drink and crime are closely linked .
" the misuse of alcohol , excessive drinking and drunkenness is closely associated with violence , disorder and other forms of social harm . "
dr hazel watson , secretary of the nursing council on alcohol and a researcher at glasgow university , said alcohol fuelled violence is an increasing problem for the nhs .
" patients who are intoxicated put not only themselves at risk from injury , but also jeopardise the safety of other patients and staff . "

the pre-emptive cull aimed at stamping out foot-and-mouth disease north of the border started on saturday - in advance of similar steps planned in the rest of the uk .
union leaders said scotland 's farmers backed the drastic measures , which will see the slaughter of 200,000 healthy sheep on scottish farms .
confirmed disease cases in scotland 46 cases on 18 march lockerbie -lrb- 8 cases -rrb- canonbie -lrb- 9 -rrb- gretna -lrb- 10 -rrb- lochmaben -lrb- 2 -rrb- twynholm langholm beattock corrie ruthwell -lrb- 4 -rrb- tundergarth moffat dalton -lrb- 2 -rrb- torthorward mouswald -lrb- 2 -rrb- creca hightae but there have been concerns south of the border , with some farmers in cumbria threatening " all out war " over the move .
meanwhile , six further cases of the disease were confirmed in dumfries and galloway on sunday - taking the scottish toll to 46 .
the new cases were at mouswald , lockerbie , dalton , hightae and two farms at ruthwell .
all the confirmed outbreaks have been in the same region , where the pre-emptive slaughter is due to start early next week .
the scottish cull got under way on saturday at farms in moray and aberdeenshire which had links to an infected market .
the following day , the scottish executive confirmed : " slaughter has been completed at the two farms and a total of about 1,800 sheep have been killed . "
infected farms the spokesman added that culls were expected to take place at four farms in the highlands early next week .
apparently healthy sheep on 500 scottish farms within 3km of infected farms will be culled - and 30 farms outside the 3km radius .
of these 30 farms , 17 are in dumfries and galloway , one in ayrshire , one in aberdeenshire , six in the highlands , four in the borders and one in renfrewshire .
the farms have flocks of sheep traced as having links with the infected longtown market in cumbria .
people talk about compensation , but money will not replace a lifetime 's work john kinnaird , nfu scotland it has been estimated that the slaughter programme , which will take several weeks , could cost up to £ 20m .
rural affairs minister ross finnie said the executive was " fairly confident " that all the animals linked to the market had been traced .
" the veterinary staff have done a magnificent job in tracing these animals , " he said .
" we are reasonably confident , but it would be foolish to say with absolute certainty . "
mr finnie admitted that all scottish farmers were going through an " absolutely horrendous " experience .
but he added : " the people of dumfries and galloway have been absolutely magnificent .
they have coped with a huge logistical exercise . "
ross finnie paid tribute to farmers john kinnaird , vice-president of the national farmers union scotland , told bbc scotland 's eye-to-eye programme that farmers were in " absolute despair " and undergoing a " terrible time " .
but he said they backed the cull .
" they realise and understand the need for this cull and know it must be done as quickly as possible , " he said .
" it is a very virulent disease and can be masked in sheep , that 's why they need to be taken out in the cull . "
mr kinnaird said he believed the pre-emptive cull would be successful in containing the disease to the only region affected .
contain disease he said : " we have to rely on veterinary and scientific advice and that 's their best advice .
" at the moment they see it as the only means of trying to contain the disease and ultimately eradicate it . "
he feared some farmers may go out of business , adding : " many people will not restart , you are looking at a lifetime 's work being destroyed and that 's not something you can get over lightly .
" people talk about compensation , but money will not replace a lifetime 's work . "
two scottish farms have completed the cull some parts of the scottish countryside have re-opened to the public , although landowners are asking people not to go near estates with livestock .
mountaineers can now roam on the northern side of ben nevis and its sister mountains - but will be have to be disinfected before they are allowed to climb .

he is urging the financial institutions these bodies represent to give " sympathetic consideration " to all those hit by the foot-and-mouth crisis .

in a new report , the constitution unit has said that devolution will have failed if there is still a secretary of state for wales in the cabinet in five years time .
the body believes that , following devolution , wales should no longer have a voice at westminster in addition to having its own elected welsh assembly .
and it argues that the posts of welsh , scottish and northern irish secretaries should disappear .
the revelations are the latest volleys in a long-running debate over how long the post will continue to exist .
earlier this month current welsh secretary paul murphy said labour had no plans to scrap the post after the election .
hague challenge mr murphy told mps that the role was part of the devolution settlement and - despite speculation to the contrary - would remain .
but , he admitted , ultimately it was a decision for prime minister tony blair .
mr murphy 's comments came in response to a challenge issued by the conservatives to guarantee that the post would not be abolished .
the future of the title " secretary of state for wales " featured prominently during the annual welsh day debate in the commons .
the conservatives promised they would keep the role but would combine it with another cabinet post to reflect the changes brought by devolution .
the comments of the constitution unit will undoubtedly set the controversial debate blazing again .
professor robert hazell , has said government policy on devolution is fragmented enough already .
he has called for a new secretary of state for the union , who could take a more rounded view of what he says are the unresolved issues of finance and representation at westminster .
the future of the post has been a subject for debate in all parties since most of the welsh secretary 's powers transferred to the national assembly for wales in 1999 .
there had been speculation that the tories would scrap the role if they won the election .
whitehall insiders believe tony blair may merge the welsh post with its equivalent in scotland and northern ireland to create a new department for the nations , if labour wins the next election .

earlier this month current welsh secretary paul murphy said labour had no plans to scrap the post after the election .
hague challenge mr murphy told mps that the role was part of the devolution settlement and - despite speculation to the contrary - would remain .
but , he admitted , ultimately it was a decision for prime minister tony blair .
mr murphy 's comments came in response to a challenge issued by the conservatives to guarantee that the post would not be abolished .
the future of the title " secretary of state for wales " featured prominently during the annual welsh day debate in the commons .
the conservatives promised they would keep the role but would combine it with another cabinet post to reflect the changes brought by devolution .
alun michael was the last welsh secretary before devolution the comments of the constitution unit will undoubtedly set the controversial debate blazing again .
professor robert hazell , has said government policy on devolution is fragmented enough already .
he has called for a new secretary of state for the union , who could take a more rounded view of what he says are the unresolved issues of finance and representation at westminster .
the future of the post has been a subject for debate in all parties since most of the welsh secretary 's powers transferred to the national assembly for wales in 1999 .
there had been speculation that the tories would scrap the role if they won the election .
whitehall insiders believe tony blair may merge the welsh post with its equivalent in scotland and northern ireland to create a new department for the nations , if labour wins the next election .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- behavioural genetics to get public scrutiny low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo bbc science correspondent pallab ghosh " there are fears that people will be unfairly labelled " real 28k dr sandy thomas " more and more genes are being linked to behaviour " real 28k monday , 19 march , 2001 , 08:08 gmt behavioural genetics to get public scrutiny scientists are identifying genes that could be linked to behavioural traits the public is to be asked how scientists should investigate the possible link between genes and behaviour .
the nuffield council on bioethics has launched a consultation exercise to find out how the public views current research into anti-social behaviour , obesity , homosexuality , aggression and intelligence .
the scientists involved are also keen to explain their work - and its implications - more fully to the public .
research into behavioural genetics is controversial not only because of concerns about its scientific validity , but also because of the ethical , legal , social and practical implications it has .
concerns have already been expressed that this sort of research could lead to discrimination and stigma .
and some groups have expressed fears that identifying the gene responsible for certain behavioural traits might even result in society indulging in eugenics .
screen babies even the nuffield council on bioethics admits that information , once in the public arena , could be put to controversial use .
for instance , it is possible that individuals found to have a gene that predisposed them to criminal activity might be ordered to undergo corrective treatment .
similarly , babies might be screened while still in the womb to weed out undesirable personality characteristics .
the research has widespread implications for the way we view ourselves , and the way we view other people dr sandy thomas , director of the nuffield council on bioethics dr sandy thomas , director of the nuffield council on bioethics , said it was important people were given the chance to discuss research which could have an important impact on their lives .
" this is an important area of research that affects the way in which we think about ourselves , and has implications for the way we treat other people .
" research in behavioural genetics aims to discover genetic influences not only on abnormal or extreme forms of behaviour , but also on normal aspects of our personalities .
" much of the research is looking at genetic factors that influence traits we all share , though to different degrees , such as anxiety , aggression , and intelligence .
" for this reason , the research has widespread implications for the way we view ourselves , and the way we view other people .
" for example , it has been suggested that if genetic factors are associated with behavioural traits , such as sexual orientation , this may contribute to discrimination and stigmatisation . "
behavioural traits last november , the nuffield council on bioethics set up a working party to examine the issues .
it admits there is a big difference between collating genetic information about illness and disease and getting genetic information about behavioural traits .
in its public document , it raises the spectre that if there are genetic breakthroughs , the research could then be misused and manipulated .
the document says : " the central precept of eugenics is the idea that the physical , mental and behavioural qualities of the human race can be improved by selective breeding .
" this means encouraging people who have ' desirable traits ' to have children and discouraging , or preventing , those who do not .
" this belief was at least partially responsible for the appalling events of the 20th century in nazi germany , and the compulsory sterilisation programmes for mentally handicapped people in north america and northern europe . "
dangers and pitfalls the report says that memories of these human rights abuses still cast a shadow over today 's research - particularly in the area of behavioural genetics where there is a chance of social prejudice and racism .
a spokeswoman for stonewall , the gay rights group , said they welcomed the public scrutiny saying it was important people should be alerted to the dangers and pitfalls of this sort of research .
she said the research had been abused before and that it was important it was not abused again .
" it is interesting that people have used that sort of research to shape their own kind of positions .
it is very problematic .
" but it is interesting that there is attention being drawn to the way that these implications can be used and that the public is going to be given a view . "
