if we follow the japanese , in five , 10 or perhaps 15 more years , we wo n't have machu picchu any more dr frederico kauffmann dr frederico kauffmann is calling on the national cultural institute of peru to urgently set up an inquiry into a recent survey by japanese geologists who found the earth beneath machu picchu is moving .
according to the japanese , there are alarming signs that the mountainside beneath the 2,250-metre-high city could give way in a potentially catastrophic landslide within the next few years .
" machu picchu is constructed over a place that is moving inside .
it 's terrible , " dr kauffmann said .
" according to the japanese , this phenomena is going now very quickly , so if we follow the japanese , in five , 10 or perhaps 15 more years , we wo n't have machu picchu any more . "
geological activity to study the geological activity in the mountain , the researchers from the disaster prevention research institute at the kyoto university set up sensitive instruments buried in the steepest slopes around the citadel .
the team found that the soils were moving at a rate of up to one centimetre a month .
the team later published an annex to their study which acknowledged that the movement was exaggerated by excessive rainfall and construction work at a hotel beneath the site in the months that they were there , but their concerns remain .
and at the site its self , there are clear signs of problems .
the incas were master stone-masons , crafting walls out of massive blocks of granite so tight fitting that it is impossible to slip a piece of paper between them .
but gaps have begun to appear in some of the constructions , hinting at movement beneath .
warning signs all around the spectacular razor-back ridge that the incas built on , there are other warning signs : deep scars on the jungle-clad slopes left by landslides caused by natural erosion in the geologically young andean mountains .
the mountain perch where the incas established their homage to the gods of the sun and the moon is also split by no less than five geological faults .
the original inhabitants managed to stabilise most of these , even turning some into drainage channels , but they remain weak spots in the constructions , and most of the damage to buildings lies along those lines .
the national institute of culture which administers machu picchu acknowledges the problem , but it insists there is no need for panic .
" this is nothing new , " said the institute 's executive director ricardo ruiz .
" the incas were aware of just how unstable the region was when they started building 500 years ago .
they were careful to protect the city when they built the foundations , and they did such a good job that there 's very little damage to machu picchu until now , " he added .
' alarmism ' danger mr ruiz also attacked experts like dr kauffmann for being alarmist .
" the geological process takes a very long time , and dr kauffmann knows this .
in reality it takes 10 or 15 years to properly diagnose what 's going on , " he said .
" so for us to take radical action after a study that lasts just two or three months would be irresponsible , " he added .
the institute insists that it is determined to protect the spectacular ruins .
machu picchu draws in some 700,000 tourists each year , easily winning the prize as peru 's biggest draw-card .
the institute has plans to increase the numbers to nearly two million by 2005 , and says it simply can not afford to see anything happen to the site .
but dr kauffmann believes the institute is simply burying its head in the sand .
" i think the national institute of culture is acting irresponsibly .
the solution is n't to hide the problem but to confront it , to see if the japanese are right , " he said .
" if they are not right , then we are okay , but maybe they are right .
we ca n't afford to ignore them , " he added .

a military band played and a small group of local people waved vatican flags and signs welcoming the visiting pope .
during the five-day trip he is expected to face fierce opposition from the russian orthodox church , moscow patriarchate , which has called for it to be cancelled .
not all orthodox clergy are boycotting the visit the pontiff , the first slav pope in history , wants to bolster the faith of an isolated pocket of five million catholics who live in the country .
" finally , with deep joy , i have been able to kiss the beloved soil of ukraine , " the pope said , speaking in ukrainian .
" i thank god for the gift that he has given me today " he then appealed to ukraine 's orthodox christians to forgive " errors " committed towards them in ancient and modern times , as catholics " forgave the wrongs " done to them .
orthodox opposition the russian patriarchate has asked the 81-year-old pontiff to stay away from its spiritual centre , the pecherska lavra monastery in kiev .

his visit follows other historic trips earlier this year to greece , syria and malta .
the pope visited greece despite vociferous objections from orthodox christians .

" i am convinced that this visit will contribute to the establishment of peace between the faiths in ukraine , " mr kuchma said .
' god-given mission ' but the russian patriarch , alexis ii , has warned that the visit could further strain relations between his church and the vatican at a time when catholics say they want closer inter-faith ties .
the visit has split ukraine 's religously divided population the local orthodox church accuses the country 's catholics of violently seizing its property and persecuting its priests and congregation .
however , at mr kuchma 's invitation and against the wishes of the ukrainian orthodox church , which is subordinate to the russian orthodox church , the pontiff will celebrate two latin and two byzantine masses for nearly two million people in kiev and lviv .
the bbc 's rome correspondent says the pope feels he has a god-given mission to heal the split between eastern and western christians .
our correspondent says the pontiff wants to go down in history as the pope who , just as he refused to accept the permanency of the political divisions of the cold war , also refuses to regard these ancient religious feuds as eternal at the start of the third christian millennium .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- cost of hiding the killers low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 23 june , 2001 , 12:17 gmt 13:17 uk cost of hiding the killers the murder investigation cost about Â£ 500,000 the total cost to the taxpayer of dealing with the murderers of james bulger could be up to Â£ 5m , according to reports .
robert thompson and jon venables , both now 18 , are receiving secret new identities on their release - granted , on life licences , by the parole board on friday .
new identities are usually reserved for spies and gangland informers or " supergrasses " who have passed information to police or testified in a major trial .
james was beaten to death and left by a railway line it has been speculated that creating and preserving the killers ' new identities from any vigilante threat and the prying eyes of the international media could cost about Â£ 1.5m.
a strict injunction prevents the media in england and wales carrying anything that could lead to the identification or location of the pair , who murdered james when they were aged 10 .

robert thompson and jon venables , both now 18 , are receiving secret new identities on their release - granted , on life licences , by the parole board on friday .
new identities are usually reserved for spies and gangland informers or " supergrasses " who have passed information to police or testified in a major trial .
it has been speculated that creating and preserving the killers ' new identities from any vigilante threat and the prying eyes of the international media could cost about Â£ 1.5m.

refugee week marks the 50th anniversary of the un convention on refugees , which provides protection to millions of people fleeing persecution around the world .
music , dance , theatre and sport events , drawn from different cultures , will mark the week in towns and cities across britain .
the refugee council , promoting the week starting saturday , says uk society has been profoundly enriched by refugees .
it points out that the inventor of the contraceptive pill , the designer of the mini , the founder of marks & spencer and the first governor of the bank of england all came to the uk as refugees .
wales trek one of the week 's events is the display suitcases and sanctuary , in which east london schoolchildren depict each other 's immigration stories .
other events include celebrating sanctuary on 24 june at coin street in london , a show by a diverse range of refugee musicians and dancers .
glasgow city council is planning a range of activities , and the refugee forum in birmingham is planning a week-long event based in cannon park .
the united nations association in wales is working with the prince 's trust to stage a trek across wales - simulating an emergency situation and crossing an imaginary border to " seek asylum " .
what is a refugee ?
under the un convention , a refugee is described as someone who " has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or political opinion ; is outside the country they belong to or normally reside in , and is unable or unwilling to return home for fear of persecution . "
the uk is a signatory to the convention , and thus has a legal obligation to protect refugees .
the uk ranks seventh out of 15 european union countries in terms of asylum applicants per 1,000 inhabitants .
however , there has been much argument in recent months about the number of refugees taken in by britain .
the refugee council says many members of the public believe the uk is seen as a " soft touch " , despite evidence that it is increasingly difficult to enter the uk as an asylum seeker .
last year , immigration officials found that about 50 % of asylum seekers were in genuine need of protection .
