the company thinks it is very difficult - that there is a remote possibility of finding anyone alive petrobras chief executive if it sinks and damages shutters of underwater wells , it could cause brazil 's worst environmental disaster , according to engineers .
despite the efforts of salvage engineers , the rig could sink in two to three days , experts say .
engineers say they are attempting to pump nitrogen into the columns to refloat the rig but they do not know whether they will be successful .
explosions one worker was killed and nine others are still missing after a series of explosions on the rig early on thursday morning .
the president of brazil 's state oil company has said the prospects of finding the missing workers alive are now very remote .
" petrobras is in mourning , " he said .
as tall as a 40-storey skyscraper , the rig has 1.5 million litres of petrol and oil on board , much of which could spill into the sea if the structure collapses .
one of the legs of the petrobras platform appears to have broken , and the rig is still taking on water , technicians have warned .
public anger there is public outrage in brazil , where state oil company petrobras has already been tarnished by a series of other accidents .
petrobras officials said the oil rig was listing at an angle of 24 degrees , or over two times more than the leaning tower of pisa .
working around the rig is dangerous - if it sinks it could drag any nearby ships down with it .
" we want to be sure it wo n't sink suddenly , and that if experts go aboard there is no risk , " irani varela , the company 's director of security , said in a radio interview .
catastrophe petrobras president henri philippe reichstul said that their efforts continue but the platform is sinking more and more .
petrobras hall of shame 1984:34 people killed in oil platform explosion and fire 35 oil workers killed since 1998 at petrobras facilities , say unions jan 2000 : one million litres of oil from tanker polluted rio de janeiro 's picture-postcard guanabara bay .
fined $ 28m july 2000:4 million litres of crude oil spilled from a broken pipeline into the iguacu river in southern brazil .
fined $ 110m if the rig does not sink there is virtually no risk of environmental damage , according to argemio pertence , director of the association of engineers .
" if the rig sinks there is the distinct possibility that some or all of the 21 pipelines could rupture .
it could be a catastrophe " he added .
the company said five ships with floating anti-oil barriers were surrounding the p-36 rig to soak up any possible spillage .
the incident is the latest in a series of other accidents .
the oil workers ' union says that over the last three years 32 people hired or subcontracted by petrobras have died in a total of 99 accidents .
unions have started staging protests against poor safety standards at petrobras , accusing the company of outsourcing work to inexperienced workers to cut costs , thus putting employees at risk .
petrobras has recently announced heavy investments in safety and measures to protect the environment .
the company says it is losing $ 2m a day because of the accident .
oil will now have to be imported to replace the production of the rig , further denting brazil 's already negative balance of payments .
the explosions have had a dramatic effect on the brazilian currency , the real , which slumped to a two-year low against the dollar .

in a former clay pit near st austell , cornwall , giant futuristic domes called biomes have been built to recreate the earth 's different climates , housing thousands of different plant species .
this is not a garden - we are creating a museum and the plants are a series of exhibits philip mcmillan browse calling itself " a gateway into the world of plants and people " , it aims to show how sustainable development depends on plants .
tim smit , the man behind the project , said he hoped it would give people " a new way of looking at the world . "
" if all we have created is an Â£ 86m theme park we should all be shot today , " he said .
' better by the day ' the largest of the three spheres at eden is the humid tropics biome which is tall enough to house nelson 's column .
snaking boardwalks lead visitors through the 12,000 plants taking them from the oceanic islands to malaysia and from west africa to south america .
" a gateway into the world of plants " along with a rainforest and 25-metre waterfall , the biome , where humidity is around 65 % , also contains plantations of cocoa , coffee and rubber .
standing inside the humid tropics biome , mr smit said he was delighted with what he could see .
" i do n't think anyone will walk in here and feel disappointed , " he said .
" it is better than i ever imagined and it is going to get better every day . "
at one point the foot-and-mouth crisis looked as if it might postpone eden 's opening but the team decided to go ahead as planned .
disinfectant pads will be placed at eden 's entrances and exits to try to prevent the spread of the disease .
" if we had not opened we would have been saying cornwall is closed , " said mr smit .
humid zone the site hopes to attract 750,000 visitors annually , by becoming " somewhere very special that not only entertains but also encourages people to action , and provides the means for them to act " .
ways of encouraging action include linking schools around the world , and relating this educational work to practical projects , perhaps in rainforests or in local conservation initiatives .
each " biome " is devoted to the plants of a particular climate .
thousands of plants from around the globe have been planted in the biomes philip mcmillan browse , horticultural director , said species were chosen according to how they fitted into the story of man 's relationship with plants .
" this is not a garden .
we are creating a museum and the plants are a series of exhibits , " he said .
the biomes are made of a self-supporting steel hexagonal structure covered in a self-cleaning hi-tech foil .
the first designs were drawn on three paper napkins while the designers were having a cup of coffee .
breeding programme the plants themselves also help to control the climate inside the domes , giving off more water and therefore cooling the air as it gets hotter .
birds , insects and reptiles appropriate to the different biomes will live in the domes and will help to control pests .
the entire project is costing Â£ 74m -lrb- $ 110m -rrb- .
it also includes a small breeding programme for endangered conifers .
the eden project is working with a range of partners , including the international institute for environment and development , the charity plantlife , the royal botanic gardens at kew in london , and several university departments .
the ambitious project received Â£ 43m from the millennium commission .
mike o 'connor , director of the commission , said eden 's opening was " a great day " .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- puffy : the road to innocence low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 17 march , 2001 , 07:01 gmt puffy : the road to innocence time to smile for puff daddy and his fans by jane hughes in new york sean combs could never have guessed that a spur-of-the-moment outing to a new york nightclub with his then girlfriend jennifer lopez would turn his life upside down .
sean combs was with lopez at the club but when they decided late on the evening of 27 december 1999 to head into manhattan from his luxury beach house in long island , they set in motion a train of events which does not even come to an end with his acquittal .
puff daddy , as he is better known , and his singer and then film-star girlfriend , were in party mood when they arrived at club new york .
it was sunday night , rap night at the club , and he knew a lot of the people there .
within minutes , he was dancing on a table in the vip area , a champagne bottle in each hand , dispensing drinks to friends and acquaintances .
bar bill when they decided to leave a couple of hours later , the bar bill came to $ 4,000 , which puffy combs paid .
but as he headed for the exit , a confrontation broke out .
his fans believed only one verdict was possible some said they saw money thrown in the rapper 's direction , a hip hop insult meant to imply that he had " sold out " .
gunfire began ricocheting around the club , and pandemonium broke out .
in the confusion , sean combs fell to the floor , terrified that the shots were aimed at him , then scrambled to get outside , all the while asking where jennifer lopez was .
one of his entourage quickly found her , they all climbed into a car , and they drove away at high speed .
speechless less than half a mile away , they were stopped by police , a gun was found in the car , and they were all arrested and hauled off to police cells .
puff daddy said he was speechless with shock .
and so began the saga that has cast a cloud over his name for the last year .
sean combs was charged with illegal weapons possession and with attempting to bribe his driver .
police said he had offered his chauffeur $ 50,000 to take the blame for the gun in the car during a whispered conversation at the police station .
his trial last for six weeks .
contradictory evidence sixty witnesses were called and they offered a wealth of contradictory evidence .
some were suing puff daddy for large sums of money , and in his summing up , the rapper 's lawyer , benjamin brafman , said the trial had turned into a case of " who wants to be a millionaire ? " .
he called them liars , hoping to profit from a conviction .
the prosecutor , matthew bogdanos , warned the jury not to be dazzled by puff daddy 's fame .
the star took the gamble of giving evidence himself .
but his gamble paid off .
calm and cool his calm , cool , assured denials that he had ever had a gun , and his coherent description of the events of the fateful night convinced the jury of his innocence .
they decided there was not the evidence to find the rapper guilty .
but it does not end here for sean combs , though .
several people have brought lawsuits against him , alleging injury or emotional distress .
in total , they are seeking $ 1bn in damages .
that spur of the moment night out to club new york will probably dog the rap star for many months to come .
