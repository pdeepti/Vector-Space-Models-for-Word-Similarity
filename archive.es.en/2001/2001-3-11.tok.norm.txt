an icm poll for bbc news online suggests an overwhelming 63 % approve of mr brown 's package - even though the majority do n't think they will be better off as a result .
only 23 % disapproved of it .
and , in a piece of bad news for william hague , even 36 % of tory voters who took part liked what the chancellor did last week .
the figures indicate that mr brown managed to pull off the delicate balancing trick of limiting tax cuts to specific groups while still increasing spending in the key areas of health and education .
only one in 10 people believe they will be worse off as a result of his taxation and spending measures .
however , the bad news for the government is that voters clearly believe the budget failed to do enough to help pensioners and motorists .
a majority of 58 % of those questioned said they believe the chancellor should have done more to help pensioners , while a massive 72 % wanted more cuts in petrol tax .
some 49 % thought he had not done enough for motorists overall .
only 33 % thought he had got it right for drivers .
that will worry ministers who have been eager to placate the two groups after last summer 's crisis which saw the government plunge to its lowest ever poll ratings as a result of protests over fuel tax and pensions .
the poll suggests that an overwhelming 65 % of people are satisfied with the chancellor 's performance , including 35 % of tories and 91 % of labour voters .
the figures will delight the government and help secure gordon brown 's reputation as the most successful labour chancellor ever .
disappointment for tories however , the poll will make disappointing reading for william hague and shadow chancellor michael portillo whose charge that labour is all about raising taxes clearly has not stuck .
exactly half of those polled now believe labour is the best party on the economy , an increase of 8 % over last month 's bbc news online poll .
support for the tories as the most trusted party to run the economy has plummeted over 10 % from 33 % last month to just 22 % now .
mr brown 's budget was greeted with almost universal praise and many in the press suggested it made a spring election a certainty .
these results would appear to underline the message .
it is usual that any post-budget euphoria wears off fairly rapidly and tony blair will be under intense pressure to seize on the current advantage and call the election sooner rather than later .
icm interviewed 1032 adults aged 18 + via the internet and by telephone between the 8th and 10th march 2001 .
interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
the bbc news online 1000 will continue to give their opinions on political issues over the coming months as momentum builds towards a general election .

more than 150 people have been arrested in the troubled squatter district of kampung medan since trouble first erupted on thursday .
machetes , knives and other weapons have been seized .
the authorities have played down suggestions that the trouble , which was triggered by a petty row between malay muslims and ethnic indians , is related to ethnic tensions .
journalists who toured the area on sunday morning say a heavy police presence , backed up by water cannon , remains in place .
machete-wielding youths the authorities are desperate to avoid any repetition of the ugly clashes of the past few days .
almost all the casualties have been ethnic indians , members of malaysia 's third largest racial group .
community leaders have accused the police force of failing to protect them from the gangs of machete-wielding malay youths blamed for carrying out a series of cold-blooded attacks .
malay groups in turn say the indians were responsible for provoking the trouble .
some families have moved out of the area fearing for their safety .
racial motive denied government leaders have sought to play down the extent of the disturbances .
sunday 's malaysian newspapers quote the prime minister , dr mahathir mohamad , as saying that it was wrong to describe the violence as racially motivated .
but when people start spreading rumours that indians are attacking malays , then people come out and clashes happen , mr mahathir said .
ever since bloody riots between malays and ethnic chinese in 1969 , the government has regarded its record of maintaining racial harmony as one of its proudest achievements .
these incidents are a reminder that while malaysia 's problems are nowhere near as severe as those of neighbouring indonesia , ethnic tensions still lurk beneath the surface .

mr khatami was making a speech to iran 's parliament summing up his achievements of the past four years .
we have no other choice but to establish democracy in our country president khatami mr khatami was elected on a platform of political and social reforms in 1997 , but his attempts to implement his programme have been thwarted by hardliners who continue to control key state institutions such as the judiciary and security forces .
the president said that he would remain in the service of the people irrespective of whether he remained president , but added that he accepted that reforms could not be achieved " in the blink of an eye " .
" as long as the people want me to be , i will be at their service .
and if they do not want it , i will be elsewhere , " he said .
he vowed to uphold the islamic regime and the pledges he had made to the people when he came to power .
" i made a promise to the people , i swore it and i will keep steadfast to this promise , " he said .

pressure for change in iran is growing despite the reformists ' sweeping victory in last year 's parliamentary elections , almost all liberal newspapers have been closed down and several of mr khatami 's prominent supporters jailed .
his reformist allies are urging him to make sure he has enough power in his second term to prevent similar setbacks in the next four years .

the directors guild of america -lrb- dga -rrb- award for directorial achievement went to ang lee for his epic crouching tiger , hidden dragon on saturday night .
the award boosts his chances of winning the best director award at the oscars considerably .
the dga has an impressive track record because the winner of their best feature film directing award has gone on to pick up the best director oscar on all but four occasions in the last 50 years .
the screen actors guild -lrb- sag -rrb- awards on sunday night could give a strong indication of which of two favourites , tom hanks or russell crowe , will win the best actor oscar .
since the sag awards began in 1995 its choice of best actor has matched the academy on every single occasion .
the prevailing wisdom is that crowe 's charismatic portrayal of the roman warrior general maximus decimus meridius in gladiator has given him oscars frontrunner status .
but he 's in a very close race with hanks who has been nominated for his role as the island survivor in cast away .
foregone conclusion although hanks is extremely popular in hollywood the sag trophy is awarded by actors .
they may want to make up for last year when they failed to bestow a prize upon crowe for his highly nuanced portrayal of a tobacco industry whistleblower in the insider .
if crowe wins the sag award it will probably bring him extra votes from academy members - and it could put the oscar trophy within his grasp .
jollity at the sag awards may be interspersed with political activism because of the possibility of a looming actors strike that threatens to cripple hollywood in the best actress race it seems to be a foregone conclusion that julia roberts will win the sag award for best leading actress for her portrayal of a feisty legal secretary in erin brockovich , boosting her chances of taking home her first oscar .
if roberts does n't win , a scenario that is seen as extremely unlikely , it would be a major upset and create a wave of speculation about her oscar fortunes .
the outcome of the sag awards supporting actress race may prove decisive in anointing an oscars frontrunner .
in what is widely seen as one of the more unpredictable contests many believe kate hudson is the popular favourite for her role as rock groupie penny lane in almost famous .
support but hudson is up against another strong almost famous contender , frances mcdormand , as well as dame judi dench who 's been nominated for her small role as a crusty matriarch in chocolat .
athough dench is well liked , there 's no great momentum in her favour this year .
the same applies to kate winslet nominated for her role in quills .
but the remaining supporting actress contender , julie walters , who portrays a tough but loving ballet teacher in billy elliot , has a lot of support and could if lucky emerge as the sag awards victor .
if she does , then her chances of walking away with an oscar in two weeks time improve immeasurably .
in the supporting actor category the sag awards are not going to provide much insight into the likely oscar winner because a strong favourite , benicio del toro , is n't running in the category .
del toro , who plays a mexican cop in traffic has instead been given a sag nomination in the leading actor race .
however , if albert finney takes home the sag award for his role opposite julia roberts in erin brockovich it will suggest that he , and del toro , are the two strongest favourites to win the oscar for best supporting actor .
strike among the celebrities handing out the trophies will be the beleaguered , but popular , robert downey junior who was arrested at the end of last year on drugs possession charges .
jollity at the sag awards may be interspersed with political activism because of the possibility of a looming actors strike that threatens to cripple hollywood .
some winners may take advantage of their moment in the spotlight to state their views on the controversial strike .
the producers of the awards telecast say they have no intention of cutting anyone off .
the combination of possible political activism , hollywood glitz and glamour , and an awards show that promises to bring clarity to the oscars race should make for an entertaining evening .

the farmers ' union of wales has accepted maff 's word that lorries removing slaughtered animals from anglesey to cheshire are properly sealed and disinfected .
farmers voiced concerns that carcasses , if not properly sealed for the journey , could increase the chance of air contamination .
farmers brynle williams - one of the leaders of last year 's fuel protests - and lloyd williams said the carcass movement was " unimaginable folly " .
meanwhile , the total of confirmed foot-and-mouth cases in wales now stands at eight after the latest , at a cattle farm on the welsh border with england , was confirmed on saturday .
ministry of agriculture vets confirmed three more cases - two on anglesey and one at painscastle , powys , mid wales on friday .
anglesey is badly affected with four confirmed cases while 17 sites across wales are still being investigated - nine are on anglesey .
why should we be frightened out of our wits by these wagons carrying deadly loads ?
farmer brynle williams on friday , wales 's agriculture minister carwyn jones said licences would be issued under strictly controlled conditions to enable farmers to move animals within a 10km radius .
the national assembly 's divisional offices across wales began issuing the licences from 1000gmt on saturday .
some farmers queuing for forms were angered after being told they required a vet 's certificate if their animals had to be moved more than 0.5km.
but the breakthrough on animal movement has been welcomed by the farmers ' union of wales and national farmers ' union cymru .
fuw president bob parry warned many new-born lambs and calves might die if they were not allowed to be moved from fields to farm buildings .
mr jones added that rules on entering certain parts of the countryside would be reviewed on 16 march .
the welsh tourism industry is the latest potential casualty of the crisis .
mrs rae duffield , secretary of the beddgelert tourism association has written to gwynedd council warning jobs could be lost if venues are unable to open for easter .
across the uk as a whole , 140 cases have now been identified after the worst day so far for outbreaks of foot-and-mouth .
the figure compares to 185 cases after the same length of time during the 1967 crisis .
this outbreak is going to last for a long time chief veterinary officer jim scudamore with the number of cases around the uk still rising , chief veterinary officer jim scudamore has said the outbreak is likely to last for some time yet .
mr scudamore said 89,000 animals had now been earmarked for slaughter - and that 61,000 of them had already been culled .
despite this , farmers have been given hope that restrictions on the movement of livestock during the crisis will be eased .
