a judge ordered seven of them to be detained until thursday , and two more to be held until tuesday while investigations go forward .
it 's part of a culture of sloppiness , of ' everything will be okay ' police chief shlomo aharonishky the court hearing was held on saturday night as a memorial service and funerals took place .
rescue workers called off their efforts on saturday after 42 hours .
among those held is the inventor of a construction method that was banned in 1996 .
the so-called pal-kal method of construction , which was used in building the hall that collapsed on thursday night , was used in 3 million square metres -lrb- 32 million square feet -rrb- of construction after its invention in the 1980s .
the four owners of the building , the owner of the company involved in the original construction , the contractor responsible for renovations several months ago , and an engineer were among those held .
a bbc correspondent in jerusalem says they could face charges of causing death through negligence .
' culture of sloppiness ' israeli police chief shlomo aharonishky said the disaster was due to the country 's " culture of sloppiness , of ' everything will be okay " ' .
on the basis of a thorough investigation by the israeli police , there are no more people in the building major general gabi ofir an army spokesman said the operation was called off partly because the risk of continuing the search in the unstable ruins of the three-storey building was too great .
he said the building would be handed over to the jerusalem municipality which he understood planned to level the site .
engineers from the technion , a prestigious israeli university , have already begun taking samples for analysis .
hundreds of guests hundreds of people were attending the wedding party on thursday when the floor of the versailles hall in west jerusalem gave way , injuring more than 300 people .
more than 160 people remain in hospital , including 16 who are in serious condition .
the exact moment that celebration turned to tragedy was captured in a terrifying video .
footage broadcast repeatedly worldwide showed guests dancing , some with children in their arms , and then suddenly disappearing as the floor collapsed .
according to israel tv 's channel two , a preliminary investigation of the collapse pointed to negligence in the original 1986 construction , and indicated that a supporting column was removed in renovations three months ago .
jerusalem mayor ehud olmert has faced calls to resign over the tragedy .
he said it was too early to draw conclusions about responsibility .
prime minister ariel sharon called the accident a " national disaster " and said the government would meet on tuesday to consider launching an official investigation .
industrial building the city 's deputy mayor said the building , which stood in talpiot industrial area , had been built for an industrial purpose - not to hold wedding receptions .
entire families were invited to the wedding , as is common at jewish celebrations , so many are mourning the loss of several relatives .
shlomi srur said he told his son during the celebration , " the floor is trembling here , something is wrong .
i have a bad feeling . "
within minutes , his wife and two of his sons were hurled into the chasm and killed .
there have also been tales of heroism , such as that of ronnie mor , 47 , who was able to free his wife from the rubble although he was unable to walk due to a fractured pelvis , shoulder and ribs .
among the injured were the bride and groom , keren and assaf dror ; she suffered pelvic injuries but her husband was only slightly injured .

the one-day meeting on saturday also urged the un security council to do more to protect palestinians and called on the us to exert pressure on israel to accept a balanced peace .
now that the meeting is over , the results are coming under the microscope .
this gives a message to israel that it will be isolated in the international community if it continues its aggression against the palestinian people palestinian minister nabil shaath delegates disagree on whether the final communique sends a strong enough message of support for the palestinians .
iran and syria wanted a total pan-islamic boycott of israel .
iraq said it wanted a holy war .
instead , they have got a watered-down document that calls on muslim states to sever their ties with israel , but which threatens no punishment if they do n't .
condemnation both the un and the us are urged to do more to stop the palestinian-israeli conflict .
the palestinians are satisfied with the outcome jewish settlements on arab land are condemned , and the call was renewed for certain israelis to face a war crimes tribunal .
all in all , palestinian minister for planning and international co-operation , nabil shaath says he is satisfied with the final communique .
" this gives a message to israel that it will be isolated in the international community if it continues its aggression against the palestinian people , " he says .
" if it continues to reject all attempts at peaceful solutions , such as the mitchell report or the egyptian-jordanian initiative " .
it 's not a question of getting the whole muslim world behind us against israel , but it is getting the muslim world behind the right definition of peace arab league secretary-general amr moussa there is no mention of the mitchell report in the final communique because the syrians do not think it went far enough to meet arab demands .
but their calls for tough measures against israel have been overruled .
us influence the organisation of islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which ran this meeting , is dominated by moderate countries that have no wish to upset the united states .
kassem jaafar , who advises the qatari government , believes that the pursuit of peace is the only choice open to arabs .
there is no military option for the palestinians " we 're definitely not talking here about a military option because we all know that there is , at the moment , no credible arab military option against israel , " jaafar says .
" so that is a fact .
but there are other possibilities that perhaps the arabs and perhaps the muslim world can do in the political arena .
" and basically , in my view , it is to try and convince the world community , and particularly the us and of course the european union , of the necessity to intervene at this very juncture - before things are too late " .
another nakba ?
kassem jaafar paints a terrifying picture of what could happen in the middle east if the talking stops - ever bigger attacks on israelis , ever bigger reprisals against the palestinians .
he says that is a course which could lead to the mass exodus of palestinian refugees across borders once again .
moussa : no peace on israel 's terms it is the nightmare scenario which he says led to this meeting being held .
now that it 's over , the arab league 's new secretary general , amr moussa , says its achievement is to focus muslim minds on securing a balanced peace in the region .
" it 's not a question of getting the whole muslim world behind us against israel , but it is getting the muslim world behind the right definition of peace .
" that is not to have an israeli peace to prevail in the area .
this will not happen " .
strong words from the man who said this conference would fail if it just brought more speeches .
he insists it is done more than that , by reminding the world of the urgent need for a just solution in the middle east .

speaking in kenya on the latest leg of his africa tour , mr powell urged the sudanese government to provide access to all those in need .
he described the situation in parts of sudan as desperate , with people on the verge of starvation .
he made it clear that urgent steps were needed to avert a famine in a country torn by almost two decades of civil war .
deteriorating " i call on the government of sudan to do everything possible to provide access to these people desperately in need and to remove all barriers to providing them with humanitarian aid , " he said .
the head of the american agency for international development , andrew natsios , gave more details after emerging from talks in nairobi with aid agencies working in sudan .
" things are deteriorating fairly rapidly in the north , " he said .
" there are no food stocks left in both sides of the conflict , in the drought-affected areas .
we do not believe people will make it until the fall and so we have announced today an additional 40,000 tonnes of food that will be distributed regardless of need on both sides of the conflict . "
the us has been strongly critical of the sudanese government 's bombing campaigns in the south of the country .
' stop bombing ' colin powell said he wanted to help both sides to achieve a ceasefire and added that he would be watching the government 's actions closely .
" recently in the last few days , they have announced new cessation of bombing .
i think this is a good step , but it ca n't just be for a short period of time .
" they ought to stop bombing humanitarian sites altogether , so we will measure their behaviour , we 'll measure their response to our actions and see whether or not we have a basis for moving forward . "
heavy fighting has been reported in sudan in recent weeks , with both sides apparently seeking to gain a military advantage before any new negotiations and before the annual rains turn the frontlines into a swamp .
mr powell has outlined a policy of continued engagement with africa .
while praising many african leaders , mr powell issued unusually direct criticism of president robert mugabe of zimbabwe , a neighbour of south africa .
and he has urged urged the kenyan government to reform the economy and stamp out corruption .
he said the us was also looking forward to the will of the people being respected during next year 's kenyan presidential election .

the sale , one of the largest private equity transactions in britain , includes the country 's leading classified advertising directory business yellow pages , its us counterpart the yellow book , 24-hour telephone-based directory talking pages and business information internet site yell.com.
the proceeds will go towards clearing bt 's debts of about £ 28bn , which have savaged its share price .
british-based apax capital partners and dallas-based hicks , muse , tate & furst clinched the deal with a bid that was about £ 700m less than one they had previously offered .
the sale of yell is good for bt and its shareholders bt chairman , sir christopher bland the value of the division was hit 10 days ago by the imposition of price caps by uk fair trade watchdogs .
the move will , between 2002 and 2006 , limit rises in yellow pages ' advertising rates to six points below inflation , compared with the two points-below regime currently in operation .
the move would force yell , which has revenues of about £ 500m a year , effectively to cut prices if uk inflation continues at current levels .
it could cut yell 's profits by about 10 % , according to analysts .
but the new owners may ask the regulators to ease the restrictions .
industry sources said the deal was to be announced on friday , but had been delayed when the rival private equity partnership of kohlberg kravis roberts and texas pacific had offered up to an extra £ 300m to match the apax and hicks bid .
british media company carlton communications had also made an approach to buy the business , it was reported .
significant step bt said the sale was a significant step in its restructuring programme .
new chairman , former bbc chief sir christopher bland , said : " the sale of yell is good for bt and its shareholders . "
yell 's chief executive john condron said he was excited about the deal , which would give it greater flexibility to capitalise on new opportunities with small and medium sized businesses .
john r muse , from hicks , muse , tate & furst , said the purchase was part of a plan to become the global leader in the directories sector .
executives squabble the sale of yell is expected to earn senior managers at its us subsidiary yellow book usa as much as £ 40m .
the payment will be derived from a $ 250m -lrb- £ 275m -rrb- sweetener offered to the managers when bt acquired yellow book in 1999 .
in the uk , where managers are expected to receive about £ 5m , there is much anger by bosses who feel short changed , uk press reports suggested over the weekend .

the attacks happened in a shopping and entertainment area close to the police headquarters .
we 're going to give the ceasefire a chance .
but at the same time we have a responsibility to defend our citizens israeli government spokesman raanan gissin police said nobody was injured in the first , while two were slightly hurt in the second explosion about nine hours later .
the popular front for the liberation of palestine said it carried out the first attack , while the islamic jihad movement said it was responsible for the second .
us envoy william burns has begun talks with palestinian leader yasser arafat and he is later due to meet the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon .
campaign a bbc correspondent in jerusalem , paul wood , says the explosions are beginning to look like a concerted campaign , adding to a sense of national emergency following a daily diet of violence and disaster in the past week .
witnesses reported a series of detonations during the morning rush hour on sunday , along with the second car bomb blast .
the streets were less crowded than usual , on the eve of a jewish holiday , and there were no reports of serious injuries .
the car bomb blast - heard across the city - set an adjacent building on fire .
police said the device was a combination of a mortar bomb and nails .
israeli radio reported the discovery of six devices .
search police put up roadblocks and deployed helicopters to search for the overnight bombers , who - police believe - drove off in a second car after parking the one with the bomb .
" we were lucky , " said jerusalem mayor ehud olmert .
" think what would have happened if this explosion succeeded . "
police spokesman shmuel ben-ruby said 25 people had been detained , but that police were not sure they were involved in the explosion .
israeli officials accused mr arafat of mounting a deliberate campaign of incitement .
on friday , explosions in hadera and the gaza strip killed three apparent suicide bombers and injured more than 60 israelis .
israel is still reeling from its worst ever civilian disaster - the collapse of a building in jerusalem that killed at least 23 people attending a wedding party on thursday .
us role us president george bush has urged mr arafat and mr sharon to put into effect the recommendations of the us-sponsored mitchell report .
according to israeli spokesman raanan gissin , mr burns will press for a ceasefire , in line with the report which also calls for confidence-building measures by both sides .
israel has rejected one of the report 's key recommendations - a freeze on jewish settlement expansion .
correspondents say there is little optimism surrounding the mission by mr burns .
muslim pressure muslim states have vowed to halt political contacts with israel in an attempt to pressure it to end eight months of clashes with the palestinians .

the attacks happened in a shopping and entertainment area close to the police headquarters .
we 're going to give the ceasefire a chance .
but at the same time we have a responsibility to defend our citizens israeli government spokesman raanan gissin police said nobody was injured in the first , while two were slightly hurt in the second explosion about nine hours later .
the popular front for the liberation of palestine said it carried out the first attack , while the islamic jihad movement said it was responsible for the second .
us envoy william burns has begun talks with palestinian leader yasser arafat and he is later due to meet the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon .
campaign a bbc correspondent in jerusalem , paul wood , says the explosions are beginning to look like a concerted campaign , adding to a sense of national emergency following a daily diet of violence and disaster in the past week .
emergency services arrived on the scene quickly witnesses reported a series of detonations during the morning rush hour on sunday , along with the second car bomb blast .
the streets were less crowded than usual , on the eve of a jewish holiday , and there were no reports of serious injuries .
the car bomb blast - heard across the city - set an adjacent building on fire .
police said the device was a combination of a mortar bomb and nails .
israeli radio reported the discovery of six devices .
search police put up roadblocks and deployed helicopters to search for the overnight bombers , who - police believe - drove off in a second car after parking the one with the bomb .
yasser arafat said the un was failing to protect the palestinians " we were lucky , " said jerusalem mayor ehud olmert .
" think what would have happened if this explosion succeeded . "
police spokesman shmuel ben-ruby said 25 people had been detained , but that police were not sure they were involved in the explosion .
israeli officials accused mr arafat of mounting a deliberate campaign of incitement .
on friday , explosions in hadera and the gaza strip killed three apparent suicide bombers and injured more than 60 israelis .
israel is still reeling from its worst ever civilian disaster - the collapse of a building in jerusalem that killed at least 23 people attending a wedding party on thursday .
us role us president george bush has urged mr arafat and mr sharon to put into effect the recommendations of the us-sponsored mitchell report .
the conflict has claimed more than 500 lives since september according to israeli spokesman raanan gissin , mr burns will press for a ceasefire , in line with the report which also calls for confidence-building measures by both sides .
israel has rejected one of the report 's key recommendations - a freeze on jewish settlement expansion .
correspondents say there is little optimism surrounding the mission by mr burns .
muslim pressure muslim states have vowed to halt political contacts with israel in an attempt to pressure it to end eight months of clashes with the palestinians .
meeting in qatar , islamic foreign ministers issued a statement saying they had decided to " halt all political contacts with the israeli government so long as the aggression and blockade against the palestinian people and its national authority continues " .
egypt , jordan and mauritania are the only arab countries to have full diplomatic ties with israel .

the $ 279m -lrb- £ 197m -rrb- deep impact mission will be launched in january 2004 and take 18 months to approach the tempel 1 comet .
once at the comet in july 2005 , a flyby spacecraft will launch a smaller 770 lb -lrb- 350 kg -rrb- impactor , which will slam into tempel 1 at a speed of 22,300 miles per hour -lrb- 36,000 kilometres per hour -rrb- .
nasa says the mission is designed to learn about the comet 's composition , structure , and how its interior differs from its surface .
preserved in space , comets are thought to contain pristine examples of the primitive material that formed the solar system 4.5 billion years ago .
huge crater the collision - to be broadcast live back to earth - will create a crater the size of a football field some seven storeys deep .
scientists are eager to learn whether comets exhaust their supply of gas and ice to space or seal it into their interiors nasa spokesman the flyby spacecraft will remain at a safe distance to take pictures and measure the composition of the gas and ice expelled from the blast hole , and the composition of the comet rocks .
tempel 1 was discovered in 1867 and orbits around the sun every 5.5 years .
nasa says the fact that the comet has made many passages through the solar system means it is a good candidate for studying evolutionary change in its mantle , or upper crust .
a nasa spokesman said : " scientists are eager to learn whether comets exhaust their supply of gas and ice to space or seal it into their interiors .
" they would also like to learn how a comet 's interior is different from its surface .
the controlled cratering experiment of this mission could provide those answers . "

the $ 279m -lrb- £ 197m -rrb- deep impact mission will be launched in january 2004 and take 18 months to approach the tempel 1 comet .
once at the comet in july 2005 , a flyby spacecraft will launch a smaller 770 lb -lrb- 350 kg -rrb- impactor , which will slam into tempel 1 at a speed of 22,300 miles per hour -lrb- 36,000 kilometres per hour -rrb- .
nasa says the mission is designed to learn about the comet 's composition , structure , and how its interior differs from its surface .
preserved in space , comets are thought to contain pristine examples of the primitive material that formed the solar system 4.5 billion years ago .
huge crater the collision - to be broadcast live back to earth - will create a crater the size of a football field some seven storeys deep .
scientists are eager to learn whether comets exhaust their supply of gas and ice to space or seal it into their interiors nasa spokesman the flyby spacecraft will remain at a safe distance to take pictures and measure the composition of the gas and ice expelled from the blast hole , and the composition of the comet rocks .
tempel 1 was discovered in 1867 and orbits around the sun every 5.5 years .
nasa says the fact that the comet has made many passages through the solar system means it is a good candidate for studying evolutionary change in its mantle , or upper crust .
a nasa spokesman said : " scientists are eager to learn whether comets exhaust their supply of gas and ice to space or seal it into their interiors .
" they would also like to learn how a comet 's interior is different from its surface .
the controlled cratering experiment of this mission could provide those answers . "

but ashid ali , chairman of the oldham bangladeshi youth association , said some members of the white community had provoked the trouble .
earlier on saturday evening , he said , members of the national front had " rampaged through the glodwick area causing trouble , breaking windows and apparently assaulting an elderly asian woman .
" this is what sparked off the whole incident , " mr ali said " for the last five saturdays the asian community in general stayed away from the town centre because there has been a large presence of members of the national front . "
he said they had been " threatening to actually cause damage and cause harm between ourselves and the police and the wider community .
" unfortunately the whole of the uk will look at this as being a riot between the police and asian youths , " he said , " when it was clearly sparked by white youths who were probably members of the national front .
" they 've actually held back for so long , and things were boiling away and things were about to go out of control and yesterday it did go out of control . "

only weeks ahead of the flotation of its own shares , the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- has reportedly discussed a take-over of the leading derivatives exchange in the city .
does clara furse want to merge her old firm with her new ?
ongoing discussions about how the lse and the london financial futures and options exchange -lrb- liffe -rrb- could share technology going forward could be a precursor to a merger , according to the sunday telegraph .
the reported talks come soon after lse 's chief executive clara furse announced the listing of the exchange 's shares in july .
during the announcement , ms furse said the exchange is keen to cut costs by forming technology links and partnerships .
when asked whether this could include a deal with liffe , ms furse declined to elaborate .
competitive strategy speculation of a deal between liffe and the lse has been rife ever since ms furse was hired as the stock exchange 's new boss in january .
ms furse was a liffe board member for nine years and held the position as deputy chairman until 1999 .
at the time of her appointment to the lse , a potential link-up between the stock exchange and liffe was seen as a likely competitive strategy .
such a deal could help counter the onslaught from deutsche börse and euronext , the merger between the bourses in paris , belgium and the netherlands , which both deal in both equities and derivatives .
a deal with liffe would enable the lse to add derivatives dealing to its capabilities .
