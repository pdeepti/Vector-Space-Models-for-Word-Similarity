the economy was continuing to absorb weak retail sales , falling factory orders and higher energy costs , the us federal reserve said in its latest regional survey .
" almost all districts report a slow pace of economic activity in march and early april , " said the report , which is based on information supplied by the fed 's 12 regional offices .
" industrial activity has continued to weaken , with orders and production having fallen in many districts . "
but the survey failed to scare investors , with both the broad ranging dow jones and tech-heavy nasdaq indices standing in positive territory , and above early lows , half an hour after the report was published .
the dow jones industrial average eventually closed down 21 points at 10,786 , while the technology heavy nasdaq index ended 52 points higher at 2,220.6 - it 's highest for two months .
interest rates the report offered some hope for observers worried about the slowdown in the world 's largest economy , saying retail sales appeared to strengthen in april .
the survey 's sombre tone may increase pressure on the federal reserve to reduce interest rates at its 15 may meeting , especially as earlier concerns over inflation seem to have subsided .
wednesday 's report noted little pressure on prices , and an easing in the country 's labour market .
" upward wage pressures have generally abated , " the survey said .
" wages are rising very moderately or are unchanged in most parts of the country . "
rocketing energy costs but the fed warned of rising energy costs , which have " hit historic highs in some areas " , and which have hit the trucking industry in particular .
in some districts , such as dallas , rises in energy costs have passed on to customers in the form of fuel surcharges .
" hikes in electricity costs are concerns in both the philadelphia and , especially , san francisco districts , " the report added .
an interest rate cut at the 15 may meeting would be the fifth ordered by the fed this year in response to the us economic downturn .

the team , led by home secretary jack straw , spent over an hour discussing whether the project to build a new national stadium for england in north west london should be scrapped .
options could include going ahead with the redevelopment , scaling down the plans or choosing an alternative site .
the inquiry team is likely to take up to six weeks to consider whether the project should receive more money .
funding collapse downing street has already criticised the football association over the collapse of efforts to raise the necessary funding .
the fa has admitted that it was unable to get enough support from finance houses to meet the £ 660m cost , and that the project would need to be underwritten by the government to proceed .
wembley national stadium limited , an fa subsidiary placed in charge of the project , has already received £ 120m in lottery funding .
but the fa refused to meet the funding shortfall .
the conservatives have demanded the resignation of culture secretary chris smith over the collapse of the project , calling it a " humiliating fiasco " .
shadow culture secretary peter ainsworth accused mr smith of trying to pass the blame for the failure in a " futile and cowardly way " .
mr smith has said wembley was still the preferred site for the project .
' choose birmingham ' but mps are urging him to consider other areas such as birmingham .
birmingham city council has gone as far as beginning talks with the fa on using a site in the midlands for the stadium .
on wednesday , conservative leader william hague told mps : " they -lrb- the government -rrb- scrapped the design , closed the stadium , dug up the pitch - now will they take responsibility and apologise to millions of sports fans for they mess they have created ? "
mr smith said the fa had told him last week that it needed another £ 300m of public money to pay for the £ 650m re-development .

the number of personal computers delivered in europe , africa and the middle east rose 11.5 % in the first three months of this year , a report by gartner dataquest said .
the news comes as the global technology sector is showing some signs of revival , helping the hi-tech nasdaq stock market rise for four days in succession to hit two month highs .
but gartner 's report also indicated continued weakness in the home pc market , which slid 3.8 % , year on year , in the europe , africa and middle east regions .
overall , pc shipments rose 7.2 % to 9.7m units in the quarter .
millennium bug hangover the rise in corporate pc spending has been put down to a recovery from the millennium bug hangover .
concerns over the bug , which many experts feared could cause a worldwide crisis as computers failed to cope with the date change from 1999 to 2000 , prompted a surge in spending on new equipment two years ago .
after this , with companies upgraded to new computers , there was much less call for replacing equipment , an industry expert said .
" the pc market was very flat for most of 2000 , " gartner analyst brian gammage told bbc news online .
" what the latest report shows is that the market is coming back .
the figures should be good news .
" but the increase in pc replacements may prove unsustainable if the economic outlook continues to deteriorate . "
leading vendors the survey also further highlighted the success of dell in increasing its share of the pc market .

the row over what attitude britain should take towards so-called " son of star wars " is intensifying a week before us defence experts visit the uk to discuss president bush 's proposals .
alastair campbell : missile defence " a good idea " downing street has insisted that no decision has yet been made and the government will have to consider specific plans .
but many labour backbenchers and some ministers fear that a decision in principle has already made .
their concerns were fuelled by comments by the prime minister 's spokesman alastair campbell that broadly speaking missile defence was a " good idea " .
mps from a number of parties , including former defence minister peter kilfoyle , have joined together to urge the government to be cautious .
national missile defence -lrb- nmd -rrb- as sparked international concern and raised fears the uk could be turned into a missile target .

mr campbell 's comment had come only minutes after tony blair refused to be drawn on the issue in the commons .
shadow defence secretary iain duncan smith asked whether it was the prime minister 's official spokesman and not mr blair who was running the country .
and liberal democrat defence spokesman menzies campbell asked why , if the government believed nmd was a good idea , mr blair had not told the commons .
but downing street dismissed the attacks as a " fuss about nothing " .
labour chairman of the commons foreign affairs committee , donald anderson , insisted that what mr campbell had said was " still a long way from william hague 's blank cheque " of endorsing the us position .
president bush insists nmd is vital for us defence but he said he thought the more cautious line taken by mr blair during prime minister 's questions was preferable .
a spokeswoman for greenpeace said : " tony blair is looking increasingly like a puppet whose strings are being pulled first by bush and then by his press spokesman . "
mr blair had already insisted that he would not be drawn into a decision until a " firm proposal " was on the table .
defence secretary geoff hoon repeated mr blair 's argument in prime minister 's questions that " we need to see the detail " before deciding .
he told bbc2 's newsnight : " we have made it quite clear that we would want to be helpful to the united states , we understand their concerns , they are our closest allies and they would want us to react to their proposal when it comes . "
the us president announced on tuesday that he was committed to building a global missile defence shield , in breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty .

he told bbc2 's newsnight : " we have made it quite clear that we would want to be helpful to the united states , we understand their concerns , they are our closest allies and they would want us to react to their proposal when it comes . "
the us president announced on tuesday that he was committed to building a global missile defence shield , in breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty .

mr persson , the first western leader to visit north korea , is in pyongyang as the head of a european union delegation holding talks with leader kim jong-il .
the swedish prime minister also said that mr kim had expressed a commitment to holding a second summit with south korean president kim dae-jung .
the north korean leader 's reported comments were his first on either subject since george w bush ordered a review of united states korea policy on taking office .
mr persson said he thought north korea wanted to be " careful about the timing " of a new summit because of the policy review .
north korea is also reported to have agreed to make arrangements with the eu to begin talks on its human-rights record .
the north korean news agency kcna reported that talks took place between mr kim and the eu delegation " in a warm and friendly atmosphere " , but gave no further details .
the european delegation 's visit is designed to demonstrate support for the inter-korean engagement policy , which began almost a year ago when the two korean leaders held a historic summit .
that marked a thaw in relations between the two countries , which still remain technically at war .
but the engagement process has come to a virtual standstill , with north korea cancelling inter-korean exchanges and signalling its unhappiness at the tougher tone coming out of the bush administration in the us .
the eu view is that the rapprochement policy represents a unique opportunity to try to end half a century of cold war rivalry on the korean peninsula - a process that is too important to let languish .
famine impoverished north korea , which has struggled to feed its people over the last few years following a series of floods and famine , is expected to ask the eu for food and other aid .
the un aid agency world food programme says north korea is facing another spring and summer of serious food shortages , with the government-run public distribution system already relying on international aid and alternative foods .
north korea 's most recent harvest was the worst since the depths of famine four years ago .
aid agencies estimate that as many as a million people may have died in recent years as a result of chronic food shortages .
