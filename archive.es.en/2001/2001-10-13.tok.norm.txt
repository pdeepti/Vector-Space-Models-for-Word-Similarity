northern ireland secretary dr john reid made the announcement that the ulster defence association and loyalist volunteer force ceasefires were at an end at hillsborough castle on friday afternoon .
the decision followed the murder of a journalist and an upsurge in street violence .
despite fears of heightened risk of street trouble and other violence , the situation was quiet overnight on friday .
mr reid said both groups have been respecified - meaning the government no longer recognises their ceasefires .
" they have systematically breached their ceasefires and i believe the patience of the people of northern ireland has run out , " dr reid said .
dr john reid has declared ceasefires over increased security is likely to follow the government 's ruling .
dr reid said : " the security forces will get the full backing of the government in anything they need to do . "
it is just two weeks since dr reid was on the brink of declaring the ceasefire of the uda - the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation - to be over .
in september the ruc said the uda had orchestrated several nights of serious rioting in north belfast during which the police were attacked with guns and blast bombs .
scores of officers were injured .
dr reid said the ruc chief constable had briefed him that the uda was also behind trouble on the shankill road on thursday night , during which vehicles were hi-jacked and burned and the police were attacked with petrol and blast bombs .
the northern ireland secretary said he felt he had made the right decision not to specify the uda two weeks ago because there was " nothing to be lost and everything to be gained from putting them to the test " .
they had failed that test , he said .
he also said police inquiries into the murder of investigative journalist martin o 'hagan near his home in county armagh were concentrating on the lvf , a loyalist splinter group .
the police have said the uda was involved in recent north belfast violence the red hand defenders , a cover name used in the past by both the loyalist volunteer force and the ulster defence association , said it carried out the murder .
but the weapon used to kill the father-of-three is understood to have been linked to a previous lvf shooting .
' prisoners could be returned ' asked what the specification would mean in real terms for the two groups , dr reid said some paramilitary prisoners released early under the good friday agreement could be returned to jail .
the police believe the lvf murdered journalist martin o 'hagan he said : " if there are people who are on licence and whose licence period has not yet expired , it will have implications for them .
" and if there are those in jail belonging to these organisations hoping to benefit from the release scheme , it could affect them .
it also applies to any offences before the good friday agreement for which people may not have been charged . "
john white of the ulster democratic party , which is linked to the uda , said some members of the organisation had been " flippant " in response to the government 's move .
he said : " they said they 'll set their own agenda and they 're not concerned about whether the secretary of state declares their ceasefire over or not .
" but they 're saying their collective organisation is still on ceasefire and that 's what 's important . "
specification welcomed sinn fein and the sdlp welcomed the announcement .
gerry kelly of sinn fein said dr reid had finally " accepted what catholic victims of the uda have been telling them for well over a year and to accept that they called it wrong two weeks ago " .
sdlp assembly member brid rodgers said : " it is my firm hope that the secretary of state and the chief constable will now move quickly to send those individuals behind the recent murder of martin o 'hagan and the disgraceful violence in belfast to prison where they belong . "
but hardline ulster unionist mp jeffrey donaldson expressed fears that the move could lead to more trouble on the streets .
" this is a very serious development .
i would urge the uda and lvf to take steps to end the violence , but i 'm very worried about what may happen in the next few days , " the lagan valley mp said .
mr donaldson also criticised the government for not acting against the ira .
and he said the government should have ensured the ceasefires of all the paramilitary groups were holding , before giving their prisoners early release .

growing backlash the jui has issued a fatwa declaring that " this war must be fought in every muslim home , everywhere " .

bbc news -pipe- media reports -pipe- guide to argentina 's congressional poll categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : monitoring : media reports front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 13 october , 2001 , 07:54 gmt 08:54 uk guide to argentina 's congressional poll president de la rua faces poll test argentine voters go to the polls on sunday 14 october for elections to both houses of congress .
the elections will be marked by continuing economic disarray and political uncertainty , reports bbc monitoring 's simon watts .
president fernando de la rua 's government inherited a sluggish economy and a large foreign debt when it was elected amid much optimism in 1999 .
the country lurched into crisis almost exactly a year ago , on 5 october 2000 , when de la rua botched a cabinet reshuffle leading to political chaos and a collapse in investor confidence .
since then the country has managed - just - to stave off a default on its $ 130bn debt through emergency imf loans and a huge $ 30bn debt swap to delay repayment .
workers are unhappy the likely world slowdown after the 11 september attacks looks set to lead to a further deterioration in the economic situation .
the standard and poor 's credit rating agency recently put argentina in its lowest category before default , and the country now has one of the highest risk ratings in the world .
the government has also sought to keep the economy afloat through a tough " zero-deficit " policy , under which it can spend no more than it raises through taxes .
this has resulted in highly unpopular 13 % cuts in salaries and pensions .
after years of belt-tightening , many argentines are now simply fed up .
political malaise many members of the governing alliance have left , disillusioned by a lack of firmness on corruption and the government 's economic orthodoxy .
mr de la rua was forced to bring back former president carlos menem 's economic guru domingo cavallo to fight the crisis , to little avail .
his high profile has become controversial and creates permanent speculation about his continuity in the role and rivalry with mr de la rua .
domingo cavallo regional issues are also vital , especially in buenos aires and in the more remote provinces , which are often dominated by local political barons .
in both the governing alliance and the opposition peronists , there are leaders who back the current economic orthodoxy and " populists " who would prefer a looser approach .
the election campaign has been fiercely fought , but the public appears to be disenchanted with politics and the turnout may be low .
the seats at stake argentina has a bicameral national congress consisting of the 72-seat senate and the 257-seat chamber of deputies .
on paper , the congress is a powerful institution with the power to raise taxes and oversee the country 's foreign debt , exchange rate and budget .
senate elections 72 seats 24 districts return three members each directly elected for first time in the past , strong presidents have dominated congress , while weak president 's have been hampered by it .
elections to the senate are in transition to a new system under which one third of the members will be elected to six-year terms every two years .
at this election , all 72 seats in the senate will be filled and the winners will then draw lots to decide whether they get two- , four- or six-year terms .
each of the 24 districts -lrb- the 23 provinces and the federal capital -rrb- will return three members , and , under a new quota system , at least one of them must be a woman .
chamber of deputies 130 seats at stake deputies serve four years about half elected every two years the seats in the senate are also being directly elected for the first time rather than being appointed by the provincial legislatures .
members of the chamber of deputies serve four years , with elections for approximately half the house held every two years .
there are 130 seats at stake at this election .
main parties alliance for work , justice and education -lrb- alliance -rrb- : the alliance governing argentina at national level .
it consists of the radical civic union -lrb- ucr -rrb- led by former president raul alfonsin and the front for a country in solidarity -lrb- frepaso -rrb- , led by dario d 'alessandro .
the ucr is historically a liberal , middle-class party , while the frepaso is a newer centre-left coalition .
they joined forces to defeat the carlos menem government in 1999 .
argentines for a republic of equals -lrb- ari -rrb- : led by elisa carrio , this is a splinter group of disillusioned members of the alliance .
it pledges to crack down on corruption and is likely to take votes away from the government , especially in buenos aires .
justicialist party -lrb- pj -rrb- : the peronist party , led by ex-president carlos menem , who is currently under house arrest on arms-trafficking charges .
the main opposition formation , although it has been prepared to work with the government to tackle the economic crisis .
menem looks like winner reflecting peron 's ambiguous legacy , the party contains a wide-range of political views , from traditional unionists to the economically orthodox .
it is characterised by political bosses and internal turf wars .
action for the republic -lrb- ar -rrb- : right-wing , pro-business party led by economy minister domingo cavallo .
provincial parties are also strong at local level .
opinion polls most opinions predict that the peronists will become the biggest minority group in both houses .
according to the new majority study centre , the pj will win 36 senate seats to the alliance 's 26 .
last senate results 1997 pj - 40 seats ucr - 20 seats frepaso - 1 seat others - 11 in the congress of deputies , the pj is expected to end up with between 110 and 112 seats after the election , with the alliance on between 88 and 90 .
in this way , the government would lose control of the lower house , but the pj 's grip on the senate would also be weaker .
in terms of national percentages , the pj is predicted to take between 38 % and 40 % of valid votes , with the alliance on less than 25 % .
last chamber of deputies results 1999 alliance parties : ucr - 85 seats frepaso - 36 seats others - 3 seats opposition parties : pj - 101 seats ar - 12 seats others - 20 seats this is partly because the pj is presenting united candidatures in all districts .
the polls also show that a high number of voters are intending to spoil their ballot papers or cast blank votes .
protest votes could run as high as 12 % in the capital , according to pollsters , although the figures are likely to be lower elsewhere .

the elections will be marked by continuing economic disarray and political uncertainty , reports bbc monitoring 's simon watts .
president fernando de la rua 's government inherited a sluggish economy and a large foreign debt when it was elected amid much optimism in 1999 .
the country lurched into crisis almost exactly a year ago , on 5 october 2000 , when de la rua botched a cabinet reshuffle leading to political chaos and a collapse in investor confidence .
since then the country has managed - just - to stave off a default on its $ 130bn debt through emergency imf loans and a huge $ 30bn debt swap to delay repayment .
the likely world slowdown after the 11 september attacks looks set to lead to a further deterioration in the economic situation .
the standard and poor 's credit rating agency recently put argentina in its lowest category before default , and the country now has one of the highest risk ratings in the world .
the government has also sought to keep the economy afloat through a tough " zero-deficit " policy , under which it can spend no more than it raises through taxes .
this has resulted in highly unpopular 13 % cuts in salaries and pensions .
after years of belt-tightening , many argentines are now simply fed up .
political malaise many members of the governing alliance have left , disillusioned by a lack of firmness on corruption and the government 's economic orthodoxy .
mr de la rua was forced to bring back former president carlos menem 's economic guru domingo cavallo to fight the crisis , to little avail .
his high profile has become controversial and creates permanent speculation about his continuity in the role and rivalry with mr de la rua .
regional issues are also vital , especially in buenos aires and in the more remote provinces , which are often dominated by local political barons .
in both the governing alliance and the opposition peronists , there are leaders who back the current economic orthodoxy and " populists " who would prefer a looser approach .
the election campaign has been fiercely fought , but the public appears to be disenchanted with politics and the turnout may be low .
the seats at stake argentina has a bicameral national congress consisting of the 72-seat senate and the 257-seat chamber of deputies .
on paper , the congress is a powerful institution with the power to raise taxes and oversee the country 's foreign debt , exchange rate and budget .
senate elections 72 seats 24 districts return three members each directly elected for first time in the past , strong presidents have dominated congress , while weak president 's have been hampered by it .
elections to the senate are in transition to a new system under which one third of the members will be elected to six-year terms every two years .
at this election , all 72 seats in the senate will be filled and the winners will then draw lots to decide whether they get two- , four- or six-year terms .
each of the 24 districts -lrb- the 23 provinces and the federal capital -rrb- will return three members , and , under a new quota system , at least one of them must be a woman .
chamber of deputies 130 seats at stake deputies serve four years about half elected every two years the seats in the senate are also being directly elected for the first time rather than being appointed by the provincial legislatures .
members of the chamber of deputies serve four years , with elections for approximately half the house held every two years .
there are 130 seats at stake at this election .
main parties alliance for work , justice and education -lrb- alliance -rrb- : the alliance governing argentina at national level .
it consists of the radical civic union -lrb- ucr -rrb- led by former president raul alfonsin and the front for a country in solidarity -lrb- frepaso -rrb- , led by dario d 'alessandro .
the ucr is historically a liberal , middle-class party , while the frepaso is a newer centre-left coalition .
they joined forces to defeat the carlos menem government in 1999 .
argentines for a republic of equals -lrb- ari -rrb- : led by elisa carrio , this is a splinter group of disillusioned members of the alliance .
it pledges to crack down on corruption and is likely to take votes away from the government , especially in buenos aires .
justicialist party -lrb- pj -rrb- : the peronist party , led by ex-president carlos menem , who is currently under house arrest on arms-trafficking charges .
the main opposition formation , although it has been prepared to work with the government to tackle the economic crisis .
reflecting peron 's ambiguous legacy , the party contains a wide-range of political views , from traditional unionists to the economically orthodox .
it is characterised by political bosses and internal turf wars .
action for the republic -lrb- ar -rrb- : right-wing , pro-business party led by economy minister domingo cavallo .
provincial parties are also strong at local level .
opinion polls most opinions predict that the peronists will become the biggest minority group in both houses .
according to the new majority study centre , the pj will win 36 senate seats to the alliance 's 26 .
last senate results 1997 pj - 40 seats ucr - 20 seats frepaso - 1 seat others - 11 in the congress of deputies , the pj is expected to end up with between 110 and 112 seats after the election , with the alliance on between 88 and 90 .
in this way , the government would lose control of the lower house , but the pj 's grip on the senate would also be weaker .
in terms of national percentages , the pj is predicted to take between 38 % and 40 % of valid votes , with the alliance on less than 25 % .
last chamber of deputies results 1999 alliance parties : ucr - 85 seats frepaso - 36 seats others - 3 seats opposition parties : pj - 101 seats ar - 12 seats others - 20 seats this is partly because the pj is presenting united candidatures in all districts .
the polls also show that a high number of voters are intending to spoil their ballot papers or cast blank votes .
protest votes could run as high as 12 % in the capital , according to pollsters , although the figures are likely to be lower elsewhere .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- anthrax ' may be linked to bin laden ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 13 october , 2001 , 08:27 gmt 09:27 uk anthrax ' may be linked to bin laden ' the cases are under criminal investigation us vice president dick cheney has said there could be a connection between the recent anthrax cases in the country and osama bin laden 's terror network .
maybe it 's coincidence , but i must say i 'm a sceptic dick cheney " i think the only responsible thing for us to do is proceed on the basis that it could be linked , " said mr cheney .
he spoke after a woman employed by the nbc television network in new york was found to have become infected with anthrax after opening mail addressed to the station 's main news presenter .
it followed the confirmation of three cases - one of them fatal - at media organisations in florida that have led to the launch of a criminal investigation .
other cases of suspicious mail , at the state department in washington , the new york times and a subsidiary of the microsoft corporation in the state of nevada , are being investigated .
the cases have heightened the fears of americans in the wake of the 11 september terror attacks on the country that have been blamed on bin laden .
cheney : " they 've trained people how to deploy and use these substances " both the letter that the nbc employee opened and the one to the new york times were posted from florida .
many media companies have refused to accept new mail in the wake of the new york case , and some new yorkers have been turning up at hospital emergency facilities or buying the antibiotic used to treat anthrax .
new york 's mayor , rudolph giuliani , has urged people not to panic .
anthrax was not contagious , he said .
experts believe the anthrax so far discovered is not the specially-made weaponised type which would be used in an attack of mass destruction .
correspondents say new yorkers have so far remained calm , with cafes and theatres full on friday night .
training manuals mr cheney told pbs television : " we know that -lsb- bin laden -rsb- has over the years tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction , both biological and chemical weapons .
" we know that he 's trained people in his camps in afghanistan .
for example , we have copies of the manuals that they 've actually used to train people with respect to how to deploy and use these kinds of substances .
it is unlikely the anthrax occurred naturally " so , you start to piece it altogether .
again , we have not completed the investigation and maybe it 's coincidence , but i must say i 'm a sceptic . "
the vice president 's comments followed an earlier statement by attorney general john ashcroft , who said there was no evidence linking the four cases with terrorist actions .
they came after a warning from the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- that there might be more terrorist attacks within the us in the next few days as a response to the us-led bombing of afghanistan , whose ruling taleban regime is sheltering bin laden .
media targets unease about a potential biological attack by terrorists has mounted since a man died on 5 october after inhaling anthrax , and two others were infected after testing positive for exposure in a separate incident in florida .
the latest anthrax case in new york - which is also the subject of a criminal investigation - involves a woman who is believed to be an assistant to nbc news anchor tom brokaw .
strains of anthrax respiratory : similar beginnings to flu but shock occurs between two and six days later - frequently fatal intestinal : severe food poisoning type symptoms - up to 50 % mortality cutaneous : rarely painful skin lesion - fatal in one in 20 cases nbc said the infected female employee tested positive for a skin case of anthrax after handling a 25 september letter filled with a " powdery substance " that arrived at the network 's new york headquarters .
she was in no danger and was responding well to treatment with antiobiotics , the broadcaster said in a statement .
cutaneous - or skin - anthrax is much less deadly than the respiratory form which caused the infections in florida .
the three florida cases were also linked to a media company , american media inc . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jane standley " tests have found nothing dangerous yet " rudolph guiliani , mayor of new york " the chances that the outbreak has been contained are very good " the loya jirga political healing what is a loya jirga ?
